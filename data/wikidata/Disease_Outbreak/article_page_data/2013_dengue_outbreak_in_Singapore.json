He then died from dengue shock syndrome on 29 May.\n\nOn 9 June 2013, a second person died from dengue in Singapore. He was tested positive for dengue on 8 June, but his condition deteriorated.\n\nThe third dengue death was reported on 25 June 2013. He was admitted to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital emergency department (ED) on 22 June 2013 with fever and low blood pressure. He was then sent to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) diagnosed with a dengue shock syndrome, kidney failure and liver inflammation. His condition deteriorated and died on 25 June 2013.\n\nAn Indonesian male was also pronounced dead on 25 June 2013 and has become the fourth person to die from dengue in Singapore.

His condition started to deteriorate on 24 June 2013 in the Intensive Care unit (ICU).\n\nThe fifth person to die from dengue in Singapore was a 66-year-old Chinese male who suffered multi-organ failure from severe dengue shock syndrome. He had initially gone to the Emergency Department on 2 July with fever and lethargy, and subsequent tests confirmed dengue fever. He was admitted and transferred to the ICU after deterioration, but continued to deteriorate and died on the morning of 8 July.\n\nThe sixth death was a 52-year-old Chinese male. He was first seen at Jurong Polyclinic on 29 June 2013 with a two-day history of fever. He returned to the polyclinic a few days later as he was still having fever and was referred by the polyclinic to the National University Hospital (NUH) emergency department. He was admitted to NUH's Medical Intensive Care Unit on the same day and was diagnosed with Dengue Shock Syndrome. The patient's condition improved transiently after dialysis and supportive therapy but he remained critically ill with low blood counts. The patient's condition deteriorated after he developed pneumonia with septic shock on 11 August 2013 and he died on 13 Aug 2013.\n\nA 35-year-old Chinese woman died of dengue on Monday, becoming the seventh death in 2013.
