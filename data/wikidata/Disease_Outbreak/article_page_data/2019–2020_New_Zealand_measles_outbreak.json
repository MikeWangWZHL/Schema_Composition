    "article": "The 2019\u20132020 New Zealand measles outbreak refers to an ongoing epidemic affecting New Zealand, though primarily in the Auckland region. The outbreak is the worst epidemic in New Zealand since an influenza epidemic in 1999, and the worst measles epidemic since 1938. The Measles outbreak of 1999 was actually predicted two years prior. An \"immunization campaign\" was intended to vaccinate 90\u201395% of New Zealand, but ultimately failed as less than 80 percent of New Zealand's population was vaccinated, resulting in the epidemic. Australia have been linked to the New Zealand epidemic. An ongoing outbreak in Perth began in October 2019 after a New Zealander visited while infectious.\n\nThe strain of this outbreak is the D8 strain and this epidemic has spread to Samoa killing more than 72 people and Tonga.\n\nThe New Zealand Government has been criticised for its response to the epidemic, particularly due to shortages in the supply of vaccines. Scientists have also criticised the Ministry of Health for not acting on previous recommendations to conduct national 'catch-up' campaigns with the MMR vaccine prior to the outbreak. Although New Zealand has had a high demand for the MMR Vaccine, resulting in a shortage, there has also been an increase of .5% of people who have declined the vaccine since 2017.\n\nTwo unborn fetuses in 2nd trimester have died as a result of the outbreak.\n\n4 cases in Fiji, and 74 cases in Australia are directly or indirectly linked to the outbreak in New Zealand and have being included in the total. To compare, the United States has only had 1249 cases from 1 January 2019 \u2013 1 October 2019 throughout the entire country.\n\n==Cases==\nAs of 29 January 2020, there had been 2,193 cases of measles reported throughout New Zealand since 1 January 2019. Auckland had been the worst-hit region, with 1,736 cases alone. The New Zealand Government activated the National Health Coordination Center in August 2019 to respond to the outbreak.\n\n\n\n==See also==\n* Taylor Winterstein, Samoan anti-vaccination campaigner\n* 2019 Samoa measles outbreak\n* 2019 Tonga measles outbreak\n* 2019 Philippines measles outbreak\n* Chemophobia\n* Measles resurgence in the United States\n* Vaccination\n* Vaccine hesitancy\n\n== References ==",
