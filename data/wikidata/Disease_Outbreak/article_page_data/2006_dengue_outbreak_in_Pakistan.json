There were 1931 lab-confirmed cases, and 41 confirmed deaths, according to the World Health Organization Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean.  Other sources report a death toll of 52.\n\nSince 2006, studies indicate that dengue fever is on the rise in Pakistan.  It is noted throughout the year, peaking at post-monsoon season. Many factors have been cited, including a surge in the principal mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti. and Aedes albopictus  However, in 2006, an additional factor may have been the lack of patient management standards, since dengue was a relatively new public health challenge for the country.\n\n==See also==\n*2006 dengue outbreak in India\n*2011 dengue outbreak in Pakistan\n*Mosquito control\n\n==References==",
