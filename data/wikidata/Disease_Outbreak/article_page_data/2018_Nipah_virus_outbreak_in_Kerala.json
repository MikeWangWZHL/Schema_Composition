This patient\u2014Mohammed Sabith\u2014was later taken to the Government Medical College, Kozhikode for further treatment, where he later succumbed to the virus. Later, his brother Mohammed Salih was admitted to Baby Memorial Hospital, Kozhikode, with suspected viral encephalitis. A team of doctors at Baby Memorial Hospital, Kozhikode suspected Nipah, as the symptoms were similar to that of his brother who had died by then. The samples were tested at the Manipal Institute of Virology where it was confirmed as a case of Nipah; samples were also tested positive at National Institute of Virology, Pune.\n\nSabith had passed the virus to 16 persons at Medical College Hospital; later two more were infected, increasing the total count of infected to 18. There were 10 deaths in the first week, including a nurse named Lini Puthussery who treated the index patient before diagnosis. The outbreak began in Kozhikode district and later spread to the adjoining Malappuram district. Health advisories were issued for Northern Kerala as well as the adjoining districts of Karnataka, with two suspected cases detected in Mangalore on 23 May 2018.\n\nOver 2,000 people in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts were quarantined and kept under observation during the period of the outbreak.

The outbreak was officially declared over on 10 June 2018.\n\n==Virology and epidemiology==\nThe presence of the Nipah virus in patients was confirmed from RT-PCR tests conducted at the Manipal Institute of Virology and the National Virology Institute, Pune.\n\nThough the first set of samples did not detect the virus in bats, later tests proved that fruit bats in the area were the source of the virus.\n\n== Response ==\nOn 23 May 2018, Kerala Health Department issued a travel advisory asking travelers to the Northern districts of Kerala to be extra cautious.\n\nOn 23 May 2018, State of Kerala, requesting medical advisory from Malaysian Health Department (Kementerian Kesihatan  Malaysia), for treatment and medicines for Nipah virus \n\nOn 25 May 2018, Sharing of Information of Virus Posted in the WHO EIS on at Malaysian Time \n\nOn 25 May 2018, the Ministry of Health and Prevention of the United Arab Emirates advised postponing unnecessary travel to Kerala and avoiding its fruits and vegetables until the situation was under control.\n\nOn 30 May 2018 construction began on the Institute of Advanced Virology, Kerala, which was founded in response to the outbreak.\n\nOn 1 June 2018, Thamarassery diocese in northern Kerala urged churches to stop giving Communion on the tongue, to postpone religious classes, and to avoid weddings and family get-togethers and unnecessary travel until the virus spread was contained.\n\n== Recognition ==\nKerala's efforts in containing the outbreak under the leadership of Additional Chief Secretary Rajeev Sadanandan and the then district collector were lauded by many, including the Kerala High Court and Robert Gallo of the Institute of Human Virology, Baltimore.
