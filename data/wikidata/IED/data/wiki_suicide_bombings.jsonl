{"title":"Kamikaze","article":", officially , were a part of the Japanese Special Attack Units of military aviators who initiated suicide attacks for the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels in the closing stages of the Pacific campaign of World War II, designed to destroy warships more effectively than possible with conventional air attacks. About 3,800 kamikaze pilots died during the war, and more than 7,000 naval personnel were killed by kamikaze attacks.\n\nKamikaze aircraft were essentially pilot-guided explosive missiles, purpose-built or converted from conventional aircraft. Pilots would attempt to crash their aircraft into enemy ships in what was called a \"body attack\" (tai-atari) in planes loaded with a combination of explosives, bombs, and torpedoes. Accuracy was much higher than that of conventional attacks, and the payload and explosion larger; about 19% of kamikaze attacks were successful. A kamikaze could sustain damage that would disable a conventional attacker and still achieve its objective. The goal of crippling or destroying large numbers of Allied ships, particularly aircraft carriers, was considered by the Empire of Japan to be a just reason for sacrificing pilots and aircraft.\n\nThese attacks, which began in October 1944, followed several critical military defeats for the Japanese. They had long since lost aerial parity as a result of having outdated aircraft and enduring the loss of experienced pilots. Japan suffered from a diminishing capacity for war and a rapidly declining industrial capacity relative to that of the Allies. Japan was also losing pilots faster than it could train their replacements. These combined factors, along with Japan's unwillingness to surrender, led to the use of kamikaze tactics as Allied forces advanced towards the Japanese home islands.\n\nThe tradition of death instead of defeat, capture and shame was deeply entrenched in Japanese military culture; one of the primary values in the samurai life and the Bushido code was loyalty and honor until death.  In  addition to  kamikazes, the Japanese military also used or made plans for non-aerial Japanese Special Attack Units, including those involving submarines, human torpedoes, speedboats and divers.   \n\n==Definition and origin==\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Japanese word kamikaze is usually translated as \"divine wind\" (kami is the word for \"god\", \"spirit\", or \"divinity\", and kaze for \"wind\"). The word originated from Makurakotoba of waka poetry modifying \"Ise\" and has been used since August 1281 to refer to the major typhoons that dispersed Mongol-Koryo fleets who invaded Japan under Kublai Khan in 1274.\n\nA Japanese monoplane that made a record-breaking flight from Tokyo to London in 1937 for the Asahi newspaper group was named Kamikaze. She was a prototype for the Mitsubishi Ki-15 (\"Babs\").\n\nIn Japanese, the formal term used for units carrying out suicide attacks during 1944\u20131945 is tokubetsu k\u014dgekitai (\u7279\u5225\u653b\u6483\u968a), which literally means \"special attack unit\". This is usually abbreviated to tokk\u014dtai (\u7279\u653b\u968a). More specifically, air suicide attack units from the Imperial Japanese Navy were officially called shinp\u016b tokubetsu k\u014dgeki tai (\u795e\u98a8\u7279\u5225\u653b\u6483\u968a, \"divine wind special attack units\"). Shinp\u016b is the on-reading (on'yomi or Chinese-derived pronunciation) of the same characters as the kun-reading (kun'yomi or Japanese pronunciation) kamikaze in Japanese. During World War II, the pronunciation kamikaze was used only informally in the Japanese press in relation to suicide attacks, but after the war this usage gained acceptance worldwide and was re-imported into Japan. As a result, the special attack units are sometimes known in Japan as kamikaze tokubetsu k\u014dgeki tai.\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n\n\nBefore the formation of kamikaze units, pilots had made deliberate crashes as a last resort when their planes had suffered severe damage and they did not want to risk being captured, or wanted to do as much damage to the enemy as possible, since they were crashing anyway. Such situations occurred in both the Axis and Allied air forces. Axell and Kase see these suicides as \"individual, impromptu decisions by men who were mentally prepared to die\". One example of this may have occurred on 7 December 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor. First Lieutenant Fusata Iida's plane had taken a hit and had started leaking fuel when he apparently used it to make a suicide attack on Naval Air Station Kaneohe. Before taking off, he had told his men that if his plane were to become badly damaged he would crash it into a \"worthy enemy target\".  But in most cases, little evidence exists that such hits represented more than accidental collisions of the kind that sometimes happen in intense sea or air battles. \n\nThe carrier battles in 1942, particularly Midway, inflicted irreparable damage on the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS), such that they could no longer put together a large number of fleet carriers with well-trained aircrews. Japanese planners had assumed a quick war and lacked comprehensive programmes to replace the losses of ships, pilots and sailors; and Midway; the Solomon Islands campaign (1942\u20131945) and the New Guinea campaign (1942\u20131945), notably the Battles of Eastern Solomons (August 1942); and Santa Cruz (October 1942), decimated the IJNAS veteran aircrews, and replacing their combat experience proved impossible.\n\n\n\nDuring 1943\u20131944, U.S. forces steadily advanced toward Japan. Newer U.S.-made planes, especially the Grumman F6F Hellcat and Vought F4U Corsair, outclassed and soon outnumbered Japan's fighter planes. Tropical diseases, as well as shortages of spare parts and fuel, made operations more and more difficult for the IJNAS. By the Battle of the Philippine Sea (June 1944), the Japanese had to make do with obsolete aircraft and inexperienced aviators in the fight against better-trained and more experienced US Navy airmen who flew radar-directed combat air patrols. The Japanese lost over 400 carrier-based planes and pilots in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, effectively putting an end to their carriers' potency. Allied aviators called the action the \"Great Marianas Turkey Shoot\".\n\nOn 19 June 1944, planes from the carrier  approached a US task group. According to some accounts, two made suicide attacks, one of which hit .\n\nThe important Japanese base of Saipan fell to the Allied forces on 15 July 1944. Its capture provided adequate forward bases that enabled U.S. air forces using the Boeing B-29 Superfortress to strike at the Japanese home islands. After the fall of Saipan, the Japanese High Command predicted that the Allies would try to capture the Philippines, strategically important to Tokyo because of the islands' location between the oilfields of Southeast Asia and Japan.\n\n===Beginnings===\n\n\nCaptain Motoharu Okamura, in charge of the Tateyama Base in Tokyo, as well as the 341st Air Group Home, was, according to some sources, the first officer to officially propose kamikaze attack tactics. With his superiors, he arranged the first investigations into the plausibility and mechanisms of intentional suicide attacks on 15 June 1944.\n\nIn August 1944, it was announced by the Domei news agency that a flight instructor named Takeo Tagata was training pilots in Taiwan for suicide missions.\n\nOne source claims that the first kamikaze mission occurred on 13 September 1944. A group of pilots from the army's 31st Fighter Squadron on Negros Island decided to launch a suicide attack the following morning. First Lieutenant Takeshi Kosai and a sergeant were selected. Two  bombs were attached to two fighters, and the pilots took off before dawn, planning to crash into carriers. They never returned, but there is no record of an enemy plane hitting an Allied ship that day.\n\nAccording to some sources, on 14 October 1944,  was hit by a deliberately crashed Japanese plane.\n\n\n\nRear Admiral Masafumi Arima, the commander of the 26th Air Flotilla (part of the 11th Air Fleet), is sometimes credited with inventing the kamikaze tactic. Arima personally led an attack by about 100 Yokosuka D4Y Suisei (\"Judy\") dive bombers against a large Essex-class aircraft carrier, , near Leyte Gulf, on or about 15 October 1944. Arima was killed and part of a plane hit Franklin. The Japanese high command and propagandists seized on Arima's example. He was promoted posthumously to Vice Admiral and was given official credit for making the first kamikaze attack. It is not clear that this was a planned suicide attack, and official Japanese accounts of Arima's attack bore little resemblance to the actual events.\n\nOn 17 October 1944, Allied forces assaulted Suluan Island, beginning the Battle of Leyte Gulf. The Imperial Japanese Navy's 1st Air Fleet, based at Manila, was assigned the task of assisting the Japanese ships that would attempt to destroy Allied forces in Leyte Gulf. That unit had only 41 aircraft: 34 Mitsubishi A6M Zero carrier-based fighters, three Nakajima B6N Tenzan (\"Jill\") torpedo bombers, one Mitsubishi G4M (\"Betty\") and two Yokosuka P1Y Ginga (\"Frances\") land-based bombers, and one additional reconnaissance aircraft. The task facing the Japanese air forces seemed impossible. The 1st Air Fleet commandant, Vice Admiral Takijir\u014d \u014cnishi, decided to form a suicide offensive force, the Special Attack Unit. In a meeting on 19 October at Mabalacat Airfield (known to the U.S. military as Clark Air Base) near Manila, Onishi told officers of the 201st Flying Group headquarters: \"I don't think there would be any other certain way to carry out the operation [to hold the Philippines] than to put a 250\u00a0kg bomb on a Zero and let it crash into a U.S. carrier, in order to disable her for a week.\"\n\n===First unit===\n\n\nCommander Asaichi Tamai asked a group of 23 talented student pilots, all of whom he had trained, to volunteer for the special attack force. All of the pilots raised both of their hands, volunteering to join the operation. Later, Tamai asked Lieutenant Yukio Seki to command the special attack force. Seki is said to have closed his eyes, lowered his head and thought for ten seconds before saying: \"Please do appoint me to the post.\" Seki became the 24th kamikaze pilot to be chosen. He later said: \"Japan's future is bleak if it is forced to kill one of its best pilots\" and \"I am not going on this mission for the Emperor or for the Empire\u00a0... I am going because I was ordered to.\"\n\nThe names of the four sub-units within the Kamikaze Special Attack Force were Unit Shikishima, Unit Yamato, Unit Asahi and Unit Yamazakura. These names were taken from a patriotic death poem, Shikishima no Yamato-gokoro wo hito towaba, asahi ni niou yamazakura bana by the Japanese classical scholar, Motoori Norinaga. The poem reads:\n\n\n\nA less literal translation is:\n\n\n\u014cnishi, addressing this unit, told them that their nobility of spirit would keep the homeland from ruin even in defeat.\n\n===Leyte Gulf: the first attacks===\n\n\n\nSeveral suicide attacks, carried out during the invasion of Leyte by Japanese pilots from units other than the Special Attack Force, have been described as the first kamikaze attacks. Early on 21 October, a Japanese aircraft deliberately crashed into the foremast of the heavy cruiser . This aircraft was possibly either an Aichi D3A dive\u00a0bomber, from an unidentified unit of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service, or a Mitsubishi Ki-51 of the 6th Flying Brigade, Imperial Japanese Army Air Force. The attack killed 30 personnel, including the cruiser's captain, Emile Dechaineux, and wounded 64, including the Australian force commander, Commodore John Collins. The Australian official history of the war claimed that this was the first kamikaze attack on an Allied ship, although other sources disagree because it was not a planned attack by a member of the Special Attack Force, but was most likely to have been undertaken on the pilot's own initiative.\n\nThe sinking of the ocean tug  on 24 October is listed in some sources as the first ship lost to a kamikaze strike, but the attack occurred before 25 October, and the aircraft used, a Mitsubishi G4M, was not flown by the original four Special Attack Squadrons.\n\nOn 25 October 1944, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the Kamikaze Special Attack Force carried out its first mission. Five A6M Zeros, led by Seki, were escorted to the target by leading Japanese ace Hiroyoshi Nishizawa, and attacked several escort carriers. One Zero attempted to hit the bridge of  but instead exploded on the port catwalk and cartwheeled into the sea. Two others dove at  but were destroyed by anti-aircraft fire. The last two ran at . One, under heavy fire and trailing smoke, aborted the attempt on White Plains and instead banked toward , plowing into the flight deck. Its bomb caused fires that resulted in the bomb magazine exploding, sinking the carrier. By day's end on 26 October, 55 kamikazes from the Special Attack Force had also damaged the large escort carriers ,  (which had also been struck\nby a kamikaze forward of its aft elevator on 25 October),  and the smaller escorts USS White Plains,  and Kitkun Bay. In total, seven carriers were hit, as well as 40 other ships (five sunk, 23 heavily damaged and 12 moderately damaged).\n\n===Main wave of attacks===\n\n\nEarly successes \u2013 such as the sinking of St. Lo \u2013 were followed by an immediate expansion of the program, and over the next few months over 2,000 planes made such attacks.\n\nWhen Japan began to suffer intense strategic bombing by Boeing B-29 Superfortresses, the Japanese military attempted to use suicide attacks against this threat. During the northern hemisphere winter of 1944\u201345, the IJAAF formed the 47th Air Regiment, also known as the Shinten Special Unit (Shinten Seiku Tai) at Narimasu Airfield, Nerima, Tokyo, to defend the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. The unit was equipped with Nakajima Ki-44 Shoki (\"Tojo\") fighters, whose pilots were instructed to collide with United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-29s approaching Japan. Targeting the aircraft proved to be much less successful and practical than attacks against warships, as the bombers made for much faster, more maneuverable and smaller targets. The B-29 also had formidable defensive weaponry, so suicide attacks against the plane demanded considerable piloting skill to be successful, which worked against the very purpose of using expendable pilots. Even encouraging capable pilots to bail out before impact was ineffective because vital personnel were often lost when they mistimed their exits and were killed as a result.\n\nOn 11 March, the U.S. carrier  was hit and moderately damaged at Ulithi Atoll, in the Caroline Islands, by a kamikaze that had flown almost  from Japan, in a mission called Operation Tan No. 2. On 20 March, the submarine  survived a hit from an aircraft just off Japan.\n\nPurpose-built kamikaze planes, as opposed to converted fighters and dive-bombers, were also being constructed. Ensign Mitsuo Ohta had suggested that piloted glider bombs, carried within range of targets by a mother plane, should be developed. The First Naval Air Technical Bureau (Kugisho) in Yokosuka refined Ohta's idea. Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka rocket planes, launched from bombers, were first deployed in kamikaze attacks from March 1945. U.S. personnel gave them the derisive nickname \"Baka Bombs\" (baka is Japanese for \"idiot\" or \"stupid\"). The Nakajima Ki-115 Tsurugi was a simple, easily built propeller aircraft with a wooden airframe that used engines from existing stocks. Its non-retractable landing gear was jettisoned shortly after takeoff for a suicide mission, recovered and reused. During 1945, the Japanese military began stockpiling hundreds of Tsurugi, Ohkas, other aircraft and suicide boats for use against Allied forces expected to invade Japan. The invasion never happened, and few were ever used.\n\n===Allied defensive tactics===\n\n\nIn early 1945, U.S. Navy aviator Commander John Thach, already famous for developing effective aerial tactics against the Japanese such as the Thach Weave, developed a defensive strategy against kamikazes called the \"big blue blanket\" to establish Allied air supremacy well away from the carrier force. This recommended combat air patrols (CAP) that were larger and operated further from the carriers than before, a line of picket destroyers and destroyer escorts at least  from the main body of the fleet to provide earlier radar interception and improved coordination between fighter direction officers on carriers. This plan also called for around-the-clock fighter patrols over Allied fleets, though the U.S. Navy had cut back training of fighter pilots so there were not enough Navy pilots available to counter the kamikaze threat. A final element included intensive fighter sweeps over Japanese airfields, and bombing of Japanese runways, using delayed-action bombs to make repairs more difficult.\n\nLate in 1944, the British Pacific Fleet (BPF) used the good high-altitude performance of its Supermarine Seafires (the naval version of the Spitfire) on combat air patrol duties. Seafires were heavily involved in countering the kamikaze attacks during the Iwo Jima landings and beyond. The Seafires' best day was 15 August 1945, shooting down eight attacking aircraft with a single loss.\n\n\n\nAllied pilots were more experienced, better trained and in command of superior aircraft, making the poorly trained kamikaze pilots easy targets. The U.S. Fast Carrier Task Force alone could bring over 1,000 fighter aircraft into play. Allied pilots became adept at destroying enemy aircraft before they struck ships.\n\nAllied gunners had begun to develop techniques to negate kamikaze attacks. Light rapid fire anti-aircraft weapons such as the 40\u00a0mm Bofors and 20\u00a0mm Oerlikon autocannons were highly effective, but heavy anti-aircraft guns such as the 5\"\/38 caliber gun (127\u00a0mm) had the punch to blow kamikazes out of the air, which was preferable since even a heavily damaged kamikaze could complete its mission. The speedy Ohkas presented a very difficult problem for anti-aircraft fire, since their velocity made fire control extremely difficult. By 1945, large numbers of anti-aircraft shells with radio frequency proximity fuzes, on average seven times more effective than regular shells, became available, and the U.S. Navy recommended their use against kamikaze attacks.\n\n===Final phase===\n\n\n\nThe peak period of kamikaze attack frequency came during April\u2013June 1945 at the Battle of Okinawa. On 6 April 1945, waves of aircraft made hundreds of attacks in Operation Kikusui (\"floating chrysanthemums\"). At Okinawa, kamikaze attacks focused at first on Allied destroyers on picket duty, and then on the carriers in the middle of the fleet. Suicide attacks by planes or boats at Okinawa sank or put out of action at least 30 U.S. warships and at least three U.S. merchant ships, along with some from other Allied forces. The attacks expended 1,465 planes. Many warships of all classes were damaged, some severely, but no aircraft carriers, battleships or cruisers were sunk by kamikaze at Okinawa. Most of the ships lost were destroyers or smaller vessels, especially those on picket duty. The destroyer  earned the nickname \"The Ship That Would Not Die\" after surviving six kamikaze attacks and four bomb hits during this battle.\n\nU.S. carriers, with their wooden flight decks, appeared to suffer more damage from kamikaze hits than the armored-decked carriers from the British Pacific Fleet. U.S. carriers also suffered considerably heavier casualties from kamikaze strikes; for instance, 389 men were killed in one attack on , greater than the combined number of fatalities suffered on all six Royal Navy armoured carriers from all forms of attack during the entire war. Bunker Hill and Franklin were both hit while conducting operations with fully fueled and armed aircraft spotted on deck for takeoff, an extremely vulnerable state for any carrier. Eight kamikaze hits on five British carriers resulted in only 20 deaths while a combined total of 15 bomb hits, most of  weight or greater, and one torpedo hit on four carriers caused 193 fatal casualties earlier in the war \u2013 striking proof of the protective value of the armoured flight deck.\n\n\n\nThe resilience of well-armoured vessels was shown on 4 May, just after 11:30, when there was a wave of suicide attacks against the British Pacific Fleet. One Japanese plane made a steep dive from \"a great height\" at the carrier  and was engaged by anti-aircraft guns. Although the kamikaze was hit by gunfire, it managed to drop a bomb that detonated on the flight deck, making a crater  long,  wide and  deep. A long steel splinter speared down through the hangar deck and the main boiler room (where it ruptured a steam line) before coming to rest in a fuel tank near the aircraft park, where it started a major fire. Eight personnel were killed and 47 were wounded. One Corsair and 10 Grumman Avengers were destroyed. The fires were gradually brought under control, and the crater in the deck was repaired with concrete and steel plate. By 17:00, Corsairs were able to land. On 9 May, Formidable was again damaged by a kamikaze, as were the carrier  and the battleship . The British were able to clear the flight deck and resume flight operations in just hours, while their American counterparts took a few days or even months, as observed by a U.S. Navy liaison officer on  who commented: \"When a kamikaze hits a U.S. carrier it means six months of repair at Pearl Harbor. When a kamikaze hits a Limey carrier it's just a case of 'Sweepers, man your brooms'.\"\n\nTwin-engine aircraft were occasionally used in planned kamikaze attacks. For example, Mitsubishi Ki-67 Hiry\u016b (\"Peggy\") medium bombers, based on Formosa, undertook kamikaze attacks on Allied forces off Okinawa, while a pair of Kawasaki Ki-45 Toryu (\"Nick\") heavy fighters caused enough damage for USS Dickerson (DD-157) to be scuttled.\n\nVice Admiral Matome Ugaki, the commander of the IJN 5th Air Fleet based in Kyushu, participated in one of the final kamikaze attacks on American ships on 15 August 1945, hours after Japan's announced surrender.\n\n==Effects==\n\n\nAs the end of the war approached, the Allies did not suffer more serious significant losses, despite having far more ships and facing a greater intensity of kamikaze attacks. Although causing some of the heaviest casualties on U.S. carriers in 1945, the IJN had sacrificed 2,525 kamikaze pilots and the IJAAF 1,387\u2014far more than it had lost in 1942 when it sank or crippled three carriers (albeit without inflicting significant casualties). In 1942, when U.S. Navy vessels were scarce, the temporary absence of key warships from the combat zone would tie up operational initiatives. By 1945, however, the U.S. Navy was large enough that damaged ships could be detached back home for repair without significantly hampering the fleet's operational capability. The only surface losses were destroyers and smaller ships that lacked the capability to sustain heavy damage. Overall, the kamikazes were unable to turn the tide of the war and stop the Allied invasion.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of kamikaze strikes, British carriers with their armoured flight decks recovered more quickly compared to their US counterparts. Post-war analysis showed that some British carriers such as HMS Formidable suffered structural damage that led to them being scrapped, as being beyond economic repair. Britain's post-war economic situation played a role in the decision to not repair damaged carriers, while even seriously damaged American carriers such as USS Bunker Hill were repaired, although they were then mothballed or sold off as surplus after World War II without re-entering service.\n\n\n\nThe exact number of ships sunk is a matter of debate. According to a wartime Japanese propaganda announcement, the missions sank 81 ships and damaged 195, and according to a Japanese tally, kamikaze attacks accounted for up to 80% of the U.S. losses in the final phase of the war in the Pacific. In a 2004 book, World War II, the historians Wilmott, Cross and Messenger stated that more than 70 U.S. vessels were \"sunk or damaged beyond repair\" by kamikazes.\n\nAccording to a U.S. Air Force webpage:\n\n\nAustralian journalists Denis and Peggy Warner, in a 1982 book with Japanese naval historian Sadao Seno (The Sacred Warriors: Japan's Suicide Legions), arrived at a total of 57 ships sunk by kamikazes. Bill Gordon, an American Japanologist who specialises in kamikazes, lists in a 2007 article 47 ships known to have been sunk by kamikaze aircraft. Gordon says that the Warners and Seno included ten ships that did not sink. He lists:\n* three escort carriers: , , and \n* 14 destroyers, including the last ship to be sunk,  on 29 July 1945, off Okinawa\n* three high-speed transport ships\n* five Landing Ship, Tank\n* four Landing Ship Medium\n* three Landing Ship Medium (Rocket)\n* one auxiliary tanker\n* three  Victory ships\n* three Liberty ships\n* two high-speed minesweepers\n* one Auk class minesweeper\n* one submarine chaser\n* two PT boats\n* two Landing Craft Support\n\n==Recruitment==\n\n\nIt was claimed by the Japanese forces at the time that there were many volunteers for the suicidal forces. Captain Motoharu Okamura commented that \"there were so many volunteers for suicide missions that he referred to them as a swarm of bees\", explaining: \"Bees die after they have stung.\" Okamura is credited with being the first to propose the kamikaze attacks. He had expressed his desire to lead a volunteer group of suicide attacks some four months before Admiral Takijiro Ohnishi, commander of the Japanese naval air forces in the Philippines, presented the idea to his staff. While Vice Admiral Shigeru Fukudome, commander of the second air fleet, was inspecting the 341st Air Group, Captain Okamura took the chance to express his ideas on crash-dive tactics. \"In our present situation I firmly believe that the only way to swing the war in our favor is to resort to crash-dive attacks with our planes. There is no other way. There will be more than enough volunteers for this chance to save our country, and I would like to command such an operation. Provide me with 300 planes and I will turn the tide of war.\"\n\nWhen the volunteers arrived for duty in the corps, there were twice as many persons as aircraft available. \"After the war, some commanders would express regret for allowing superfluous crews to accompany sorties, sometimes squeezing themselves aboard bombers and fighters so as to encourage the suicide pilots and, it seems, join in the exultation of sinking a large enemy vessel.\" Many of the kamikaze pilots believed their death would pay the debt they owed and show the love they had for their families, friends and emperor. \"So eager were many minimally trained pilots to take part in suicide missions that when their sorties were delayed or aborted, the pilots became deeply despondent. Many of those who were selected for a bodycrashing mission were described as being extraordinarily blissful immediately before their final sortie.\"\n\nAs time wore on, modern critics questioned the nationalist portrayal of kamikaze pilots as noble soldiers willing to sacrifice their lives for the country. In 2006, Tsuneo Watanabe, editor-in-chief of the Yomiuri Shimbun, criticized Japanese nationalists' glorification of kamikaze attacks:\n\nIt's all a lie that they left filled with braveness and joy, crying, \"Long live the emperor!\" They were sheep at a slaughterhouse. Everybody was looking down and tottering. Some were unable to stand up and were carried and pushed into the plane by maintenance soldiers.\n\n==Training==\n\n\nTokk\u014dtai pilot training, as described by Takeo Kasuga, generally \"consisted of incredibly strenuous training, coupled with cruel and torturous corporal punishment as a daily routine\". Daikichi Irokawa, who trained at Tsuchiura Naval Air Base, recalled that he \"was struck on the face so hard and frequently that [his] face was no longer recognizable\". He also wrote: \"I was hit so hard that I could no longer see and fell on the floor. The minute I got up, I was hit again by a club so that I would confess.\" This brutal \"training\" was justified by the idea that it would instill a \"soldier's fighting spirit\", but daily beatings and corporal punishment eliminated patriotism among many pilots.\n\n\n\nPilots were given a manual that detailed how they were supposed to think, prepare and attack. From this manual, pilots were told to \"attain a high level of spiritual training\", and to \"keep [their] health in the very best condition\". These instructions, among others, were meant to make pilots mentally ready to die.\n\nThe tokk\u014dtai pilot's manual also explained how a pilot may turn back if the pilot could not locate a target and that \"[a pilot] should not waste [his] life lightly\". One pilot who continually came back to base was shot after his ninth return.\n\nThe manual was very detailed in how a pilot should attack. A pilot would dive towards his target and \"aim for a point between the bridge tower and the smoke stacks\". Entering a smoke stack was also said to be \"effective\". Pilots were told not to aim at a ship's bridge tower or gun turret but instead to look for elevators or the flight deck to hit. For horizontal attacks, the pilot was to \"aim at the middle of the vessel, slightly higher than the waterline\" or to \"aim at the entrance to the aircraft hangar, or the bottom of the stack\" if the former was too difficult.\n\nThe tokk\u014dtai pilot's manual told pilots to never close their eyes, as this would lower the chances of hitting their targets. In the final moments before the crash, the pilot was to yell \"hissatsu\" (\u5fc5\u6bba) at the top of his lungs, which translates to \"certain kill\".\n\n==Cultural background==\nIn 1944\u201345, US military leaders invented the term \"State Shinto\" as part of the Shinto Directive to differentiate the Japanese state's ideology from traditional Shinto practices. As time went on, Americans claimed, Shinto was used increasingly in the promotion of nationalist sentiment. In 1890, the Imperial Rescript on Education was passed, under which students were required to ritually recite its oath to offer themselves \"courageously to the state\" as well as protect the Imperial family. The ultimate offering was to give up one's life. It was an honour to die for Japan and the Emperor. Axell and Kase pointed out: \"The fact is that innumerable soldiers, sailors and pilots were determined to die, to become eirei, that is 'guardian spirits' of the country. ... Many Japanese felt that to be enshrined at Yasukuni was a special honour because the Emperor visited the shrine to pay homage twice a year. Yasukuni is the only shrine deifying common men which the Emperor would visit to pay his respects.\" Young Japanese people were indoctrinated from an early age with these ideals.\n\n\n\nFollowing the commencement of the kamikaze tactic, newspapers and books ran advertisements, articles and stories regarding the suicide bombers to aid in recruiting and support. In October 1944, the Nippon Times quoted Lieutenant Sekio Nishina: \"The spirit of the Special Attack Corps is the great spirit that runs in the blood of every Japanese ... The crashing action which simultaneously kills the enemy and oneself without fail is called the Special Attack ... Every Japanese is capable of becoming a member of the Special Attack Corps.\" Publishers also played up the idea that the kamikaze were enshrined at Yasukuni and ran exaggerated stories of kamikaze bravery \u2013 there were even fairy tales for little children that promoted the kamikaze. A Foreign Office official named Toshikazu Kase said: \"It was customary for GHQ [in Tokyo] to make false announcements of victory in utter disregard of facts, and for the elated and complacent public to believe them.\"\n\nWhile many stories were falsified, some were true, such as that of Kiyu Ishikawa, who saved a Japanese ship when he crashed his plane into a torpedo that an American submarine had launched. The sergeant major was posthumously promoted to second lieutenant by the emperor and was enshrined at Yasukuni. Stories like these, which showed the kind of praise and honour death produced, encouraged young Japanese to volunteer for the Special Attack Corps and instilled a desire in the youth to die as a kamikaze.\n\nCeremonies were carried out before kamikaze pilots departed on their final mission. The kamikaze shared ceremonial cups of sake or water known as \"mizu no sakazuki\". Many Army officer kamikaze took their swords along, while the Navy pilots (as a general rule) did not. The kamikaze, along with all Japanese aviators flying over unfriendly territory, were issued (or purchased, if they were officers) a Nambu pistol with which to end their lives if they risked being captured. Like all Army and Navy servicemen, the kamikaze would wear their senninbari, a \"belt of a thousand stitches\" given to them by their mothers. They also composed and read a death poem, a tradition stemming from the samurai, who did so before committing seppuku. Pilots carried prayers from their families and were given military decorations. The kamikaze were escorted by other pilots whose function was to protect them en route to their destination and report on the results. Some of these escort pilots, such as Zero pilot Toshimitsu Imaizumi, were later sent out on their own kamikaze missions.\n\n\n\nWhile it is commonly perceived that volunteers signed up in droves for kamikaze missions, it has also been contended that there was extensive coercion and peer pressure involved in recruiting soldiers for the sacrifice. Their motivations in \"volunteering\" were complex and not simply about patriotism or bringing honour to their families. Firsthand interviews with surviving kamikaze and escort pilots has revealed that they were motivated by a desire to protect their families from perceived atrocities and possible extinction at the hands of the Allies. They viewed themselves as the last defense.\n\nAt least one of these pilots was a conscripted Korean with a Japanese name, adopted under the pre-war Soshi-kaimei ordinance that compelled Koreans to take Japanese personal names. Eleven of the 1,036 IJA kamikaze pilots who died in sorties from Chiran and other Japanese air bases during the Battle of Okinawa were Koreans.\n\nIt is said that young pilots on kamikaze missions often flew southwest from Japan over the  Mount Kaimon. The mountain is also called \"Satsuma Fuji\" (meaning a mountain like Mount Fuji but located in the Satsuma Province region). Suicide-mission pilots looked over their shoulders to see the mountain, the southernmost on the Japanese mainland, said farewell to their country and saluted the mountain. Residents on Kikaishima Island, east of Amami \u014cshima, say that pilots from suicide-mission units dropped flowers from the air as they departed on their final missions.\n\nKamikaze pilots who were unable to complete their missions (because of mechanical failure, interception, etc.) were stigmatized in the years following the war. This stigma began to diminish some 50 years after the war as scholars and publishers began to distribute the survivors' stories.\n\nSome Japanese military personnel were critical of the policy. Officers such as Minoru Genda, Tadashi Minobe and Yoshio Shiga, refused to obey the policy. They said that the commander of a kamikaze attack should engage in the task first. Some persons who obeyed the policy, such as Kiyokuma Okajima, Saburo Shindo and Iyozo Fujita, were also critical of the policy. Sabur\u014d Sakai said: \"We never dared to question orders, to doubt authority, to do anything but immediately carry out all the commands of our superiors. We were automatons who obeyed without thinking.\" Tetsuzo Iwamoto refused to engage in a kamikaze attack because he thought the task of fighter pilots was to shoot down aircraft.\n\n==Quotations==\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==Film==\n* Saigo no Tokk\u014dtai (\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u7279\u653b\u968a, The Last Kamikaze in English), released in 1970, produced by Toei, directed by Junya Sato and starring K\u014dji Tsuruta, Ken Takakura and Shinichi Chiba\n* Toei also produced a biographical film about Takijir\u014d \u014cnishi in 1974 called \u0100 Kessen K\u014dk\u016btai (\u3042\u309d\u6c7a\u6226\u822a\u7a7a\u968a, Father of the Kamikaze in English), directed by K\u014dsaku Yamashita.\n* The Cockpit, an anthology of short films containing one about a kamikaze pilot\n* Masami Takahashi, Last Kamikaze Testimonials from WWII Suicide Pilots (Watertown, MA:  Documentary Educational Resources, 2008)\n* Risa Morimoto, Wings of Defeat (Harriman, NY:  New Day Films, 2007)\n* Ore wa, kimi no tameni koso (2007, For Those We Love in English)\n* Assault on the Pacific \u2013 Kamikaze (2007), directed by Taku Shinjo (Original title: \"\u4ffa\u306f\u3001\u541b\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3053\u305d\u6b7b\u306b\u306b\u3044\u304f\" Ore wa, Kimi no Tame ni Koso Shini ni Iku)\n* The Eternal Zero (\u6c38\u9060\u306e0 Eien no Zero) \u2013 2013 film directed by Takashi Yamazaki\n\n==See also==\n* Banzai charge\n* Bushido\n* Chiran Peace Museum for Kamikaze Pilots\n* List of Imperial Japanese Army air-to-surface special attack units\n* List of Imperial Japanese Navy air-to-surface special attack units\n* List of ships damaged by kamikaze attack\n* Living torpedoes\n* Ry\u014dji Uehara\n* Sonderkommando Elbe\n* Suicide by pilot\n* Suicide weapon\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* Peattie, Mark R.

{"title":"2001 shoe bomb attempt","article":"The 2001 shoe bomb attempt was a failed bombing attempt that occurred on December 22, 2001, on American Airlines Flight 63. The aircraft, a Boeing 767-300 (registration N384AA) with 197 passengers and crew aboard, was flying from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France, to Miami International Airport in the U.S. state of Florida.\n\nThe perpetrator, Richard Reid, was subdued by passengers after unsuccessfully attempting to detonate plastic explosives concealed within his shoes. The flight was diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston, escorted by American jet fighters, and landed without further incident. Reid was arrested and eventually sentenced to 3 life terms plus 110 years, without parole.\n\n==Incident==\n\nAs Flight 63 was flying over the Atlantic Ocean, Richard Reid \u2013 an Islamic fundamentalist from the United Kingdom, and self-proclaimed Al-Qaeda operative \u2013 carried shoes that were packed with two types of explosives. He had been refused permission to board the flight the day before.\n\nPassengers on the flight complained of a smoke smell shortly after meal service. One flight attendant, Hermis Moutardier, walked the aisles of the plane to locate the source. She found Reid sitting alone near a window, attempting to light a match. Moutardier warned him that smoking was not allowed on the airplane, and Reid promised to stop.\n\nA few minutes later, Moutardier found Reid leaning over in his seat, and unsuccessfully attempted to get his attention. After she asked him what he was doing, Reid grabbed at her, revealing one shoe in his lap, a fuse leading into the shoe, and a lit match. He was unable to detonate the bomb: perspiration from his feet dampened the triacetone triperoxide (TATP) and prevented it from igniting.\n\nMoutardier tried grabbing Reid twice, but he pushed her to the floor each time, and she screamed for help. When another flight attendant, Cristina Jones, arrived to try to subdue him, he fought her and bit her thumb.\n\nThe  tall Reid who weighed about 215 pounds (97kg) was subdued by other passengers on the aircraft and immobilized using plastic handcuffs, seatbelt extensions, and headphone cords. A doctor administered diazepam found in the flight kit of the aircraft. Many of the passengers only became aware of the situation when the pilot announced that the flight was to be diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston.\n\nTwo F-15 fighter jets escorted Flight 63 to Logan Airport. The plane parked in the middle of the runway, and Reid was arrested on the ground while the rest of the passengers were bussed to the main terminal. Authorities later found over 280\u00a0grams (10\u00a0oz) of TATP and PETN hidden in the hollowed soles of Reid's shoes, enough to blow a substantial hole in the aircraft. He pleaded guilty, was convicted, sentenced to 3 life terms plus 110 years without parole and incarcerated at Supermax prison ADX Florence.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nSix months after the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 in Queens, New York on November 12, 2001, Mohammed Mansour Jabarah agreed to cooperate with American authorities in exchange for a reduced sentence. He said that fellow Canadian Abderraouf Jdey had been responsible for the flight's destruction, using a shoe bomb similar to that found on Reid several months earlier. This claim remains unsubstantiated by the investigation into the cause of the crash; Jabarah was a known colleague of Khalid Sheikh Mohamed, and said that Reid and Jdey had both been enlisted by the al-Qaeda chief to participate in identical plots.\n\nIn 2006, security procedures at US airports were changed to have people remove their shoes before proceeding through scanners, in response to this incident. The requirement was phased out for some travelers, particularly those with TSA PreCheck, in the 2010s.\n\nFlight Number AAL63 continues to be used on the route from Paris to Miami.\n\n==External links==\n* Bomb on Flight 63 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2015\n\n==See also==\n\n*1988 Lockerbie Bombing, Pan Am plane destroyed by PETN bomb, killing 270 people \u2013 event happened 13 years exactly prior to the shoe bomb incident\n* 1994 Philippine Airlines Flight 434, test run for al-Qaeda Operation Bojinka, killing one plane passenger in bombing\n* 1995 Bojinka plot, al-Qaeda plot to blow up 12 planes as they flew from Asia to the US\n*2006 Transatlantic Aircraft Plot, failed plot to blow up at least 10 planes as they flew from the UK to the US and Canada\n*2009 Christmas Day bomb plot, failed al-Qaeda PETN bombing of plane\n*2010 cargo plane bomb plot, failed al-Qaeda PETN bombing of plane\n*List of accidents and incidents involving commercial aircraft\n*List of terrorist incidents, 2001\n*September 11 Attacks\n\n== References ==\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRichard Reid, the perpetrator of the incident.","urls":["http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/covers\/1101020909\/aattendants.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100604162640\/http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/covers\/1101020909\/aattendants.html","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2001\/US\/12\/24\/investigation.plane\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150121004020\/http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2001\/US\/12\/24\/investigation.plane\/","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2009\/dec\/27\/petn-pentaerythritol-trinitrate-explosive","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20130908213032\/http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2009\/dec\/27\/petn-pentaerythritol-trinitrate-explosive","http:\/\/www.jamestown.org\/terrorism\/news\/uploads\/ter_003_015.pdf","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20081116015239\/http:\/\/www.jamestown.org\/terrorism\/news\/uploads\/ter_003_015.pdf","http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2003\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/southeast\/01\/30\/reid.alqaeda\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20070104171205\/http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2003\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/southeast\/01\/30\/reid.alqaeda\/","http:\/\/www.tsa.gov\/travelers\/airtravel\/screening\/index.shtm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110511230241\/http:\/\/www.tsa.gov\/travelers\/airtravel\/screening\/index.shtm","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/local\/shoe-removal-requirement-at-airports-to-be-phased-out\/2011\/09\/06\/gIQAknLD7J_story.html","https:\/\/www.chicagotribune.com\/nation-world\/ct-xpm-2011-10-09-chi-tsa-children-pose-little-risk-can-keep-shoes-on-during-security-check-20111009-story.html","https:\/\/flightaware.com\/live\/flight\/AAL63","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160508121628\/https:\/\/flightaware.com\/live\/flight\/AAL63"]}
{"title":"Explosive belt","article":"An explosive belt (also called suicide belt, suicide vest) is an improvised explosive device, a belt or a vest packed with explosives and armed with a detonator, worn by suicide bombers. Explosive belts are usually packed with ball bearings, nails, screws, bolts, and other objects that serve as shrapnel to maximize the number of casualties in the explosion.\n\n==History==\nThe Chinese used explosive vests during the Second Sino-Japanese War. A Chinese soldier detonated a grenade vest and killed 20 Japanese at Sihang Warehouse. Chinese troops strapped explosives like grenade packs or dynamite to their bodies and threw themselves under Japanese tanks to blow them up. This tactic was used during the Battle of Shanghai, where a Chinese suicide bomber stopped a Japanese tank column by exploding himself beneath the lead tank, and at the Battle of Taierzhuang, where Chinese troops rushed at Japanese tanks and blew themselves up with dynamite and grenades.  During one incident at Taierzhuang, Chinese suicide bombers destroyed four Japanese tanks with grenade bundles.\n\nThe use of suicidal attacks to inflict damage upon an enemy predates the Second World War, in which Kamikaze units (suicidal air attacks) and Kaiten (\"living torpedoes\") were used to attack Allied forces. Japanese soldiers routinely sacrificed themselves by attacking Allied tanks while carrying antitank mines, magnetic demolition charges, hand grenades and other explosive devices.\n\n==Description==\nThe explosive belt usually consists of several cylinders filled with explosive (de facto pipe bombs), or in more sophisticated versions with plates of explosive. The explosive is surrounded by a fragmentation jacket that produces the shrapnel responsible for most of the bomb's lethality, effectively making the jacket a crude, body-worn, Claymore mine. Once the vest is detonated, the explosion resembles an omnidirectional shotgun blast. The most dangerous and the most widely used shrapnel are steel balls  in diameter. Other shrapnel material can be anything of suitable size and hardness, most often nails, screws, nuts, and thick wire. Shrapnel is responsible for about 90% of all casualties caused by this kind of device.\n\nA \"loaded\" vest may weigh between  and may be hidden under thick clothes, usually jackets or snow coats.\n\nA suicide vest may cover the entire stomach and usually has shoulder straps.\n\nA common security procedure against suspected suicide bombers is to move the suspect to at least  away from other people, and ask them  to remove their upper clothing in order to see if there is an explosive vest strapped under them. While this procedure is relatively uncontroversial for use on males, it may cause an issue when dealing with females suspected to be suicide bombers. Male security personnel may be reluctant to inspect females or strip-search them; furthermore, security personnel doing strip-searches can be accused of sexual harassment. Alternatively, an infrared detector can be used. There are assertions that using a millimeter wave scanner would be viable for the task, but the concept has been disputed.\n\nThe discovery of remains as well as incidentally unexploded belts or vests can offer forensic clues to the investigation after the attack.\n\n==Forensic investigation==\nSuicide bombers who wear the vests are often obliterated by the explosion; the best evidence of their identity is the head, which often survives because it is separated and thrown clear of the body by the explosion. Journalist Joby Warrick conjectured: \"The vest's tight constraints and the positioning of the explosive pouches would channel the energy of the blast outward, toward whoever stood directly in front of him. Some of that energy wave would inevitably roll upward, ripping the bomber's body apart at its weakest point, between the neck bones and lower jaw. It accounts for the curious phenomenon in which suicide bombers' heads are severed clean at the moment of detonation and are later found in a state of perfect preservation several yards away from the torso's shredded remains.\"\n\n== See also ==\n* Car bomb\n* Terrorism\n* Suicide weapon\n* Suicide attack\n* Islamic terrorism\n** Female suicide bomber\n** Child suicide bombers in the

{"title":"Alas Chiricanas Flight 901","article":"Alas Chiricanas Flight 00901, registered  HP-1202AC, was an Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante aircraft flying en route from Col\u00f3n city to Panama City which exploded shortly after departing Enrique Adolfo Jim\u00e9nez Airport, on the night of July 19, 1994. All 21 on board, including 12 Jews, were killed in the bombing. Both Panamanian and American authorities consider the bombing an unsolved crime and an act of terrorism.\n\nThe wreckage of the Bandeirante was strewn about the Santa Rita Mountains near Col\u00f3n. Panamanian investigators quickly determined that the explosion had been caused by a bomb, probably detonated by a suicide bomber aboard the aircraft. Only one body was not claimed by relatives; this body is believed to be that of a man named Jamal Lya.  Officials suspected that the incident was an act of terrorism by  Hezbollah directed against Jews in part because it took place one day after the AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires, and due to an expression of support by \"Ansar Allah\", a Hezbollah affiliate in South America.\n\nIn 2018, the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela said \"recent evidence\" and intelligence reports \"clearly show it was a terrorist attack,\" and that he would ask local and international authorities to reopen the investigation.

{"title":"Dying to Win","article":"Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism is Robert Pape's analysis of suicide terrorism from a strategic, social, and psychological point of view. It is based on a database he has compiled at the University of Chicago, where he directs the  Chicago Project on Security and Threats (CPOST). The book's conclusions are based on data from 315 suicide terrorism attacks around the world from 1980 through 2003. Of these, 301 were classified into 18 different campaigns by 11 different militant groups; the remaining 14 appear to have been isolated. Published in May 2005, Pape's volume has been widely noticed by the press, the public, and policymakers alike, and has earned praise from the likes of Peter Bergen, Congressman Ron Paul (R-Texas), and Michael Scheuer.\n\nDying to Win is divided into three parts, analyzing the strategic, social, and psychological dimension of suicide terrorism.\n\n==Detailed synopsis==\n\n===Introduction===\n\n====Chapter 1: The Growing Threat====\nPape claims to have compiled the world's first \"database of every suicide bombing and attack around the globe from 1980 through 2003\u2014315 attacks in all\" (3). \"The data show that there is little connection between suicide terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism, or any one of the world's religions. ... Rather, what nearly all suicide terrorist attacks have in common is a specific secular and strategic goal: to compel modern democracies to withdraw military forces from territory that the terrorists consider to be their homeland\" (4). It is important that Americans understand this growing phenomenon (4\u20137).\n\n====Chapter 2: Explaining Suicide Terrorism====\nCaveat: the book's conclusions do not hold for terrorism in general (8\u20139). Pape distinguishes among demonstrative terrorism, which seeks publicity, destructive terrorism, which seeks to exert coercion through the threat of injury and death as well as to mobilize support, and suicide terrorism, which involves an attacker's actually killing himself or herself along with others, generally as part of a campaign (9\u201311). Three historical episodes are introduced for purposes of comparison: the ancient Jewish Zealots (11\u201312; see also 33\u201334), the 11th-12th-century Ismaili Assassins (12\u201313; see also 34\u201335), and the Japanese kamikazes (13; see also 35\u201337).\n\nPape had graduate students fluent in many languages scour the international press for incidents of suicide terrorism. There was no suicide terrorism from 1945 to 1980 (13\u201314). They found 315 incidents, beginning with the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing (14). They were able to classify all but 14 of the incidents into 18 different campaigns by 10 different organizations of predominantly Muslim, Hindu or Sikh religious persuasion. These included the Tamil Tigers (July 1990), the Israeli occupation of Palestine (1994), Persian Gulf (1995), Turkey (1996), Chechnya (2000), Kashmir (2000), and the U.S. (2001) (14\u201315). Five campaigns were still ongoing in early 2004, when Dying to Win was being written (15\u201316).\n\nTraditional explanations for suicide terrorism focus on individual motives, but fail to explain the specificity of suicide terrorism (16\u201317). Economic explanation of this phenomenon yields \"poor\" results (17\u201319). Explanation of suicide terrorism as a form of competition between radical groups is dubious (19\u201320).\n\nPape proposes an alternative explanation of the \"causal logic of suicide terrorism\": at the strategic level, suicide terrorism exerts coercive power against democratic states to cease occupation of territory terrorists consider homeland, while at the social level it depends on mass support and at the individual level it is motivated by altruism (20\u201323). All 18 campaigns shared two elements: (1) a foreign occupation (2) by a democracy.  Only one of the 10 groups shared a religion with the occupiers:  the Kurdistan Workers' Party in Turkey. \"The bottom line, then, is that suicide terrorism is mainly a response to foreign occupation\" (23).\n\n===Part I: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism===\n\n====Chapter 3: A Strategy for Weak Actors====\nThe willingness of an attacker to die has strategic value (27\u201329). As a weapon of weak groups incapable of \"denial\" as a \"coercive strategy,\" suicide terrorism relies on punishment and, especially, \"the expectation of future damage,\" which provides coercive leverage (29\u201333).\n\n====Chapter 4: Targeting Democracies====\nPape claims that his research reveals that the key to understanding the phenomenon of suicide attacks is not religion, but that they \"compel democracies to withdraw military forces from the terrorists' national homeland\" (38). Patterns of timing (39\u201341), nationalist goals (42\u201344), and the targeting of democracies (44\u201345) reveal its logical, not irrational, nature. \"At bottom, suicide terrorism is a strategy for national liberation from foreign military occupation by a democratic state\" (45). Foreign occupation is defined in terms of control of territory (not military occupation alone) (46). The targets selected by suicide terrorists suggests nationalist, not religious, aims (46\u201347). Hamas (47\u201351) and Al-Qaeda (51\u201358) are analyzed in some detail. In general, the harshness of occupation does not strongly correlate with suicide terrorism (58\u201360).\n\n====Chapter 5: Learning Terrorism Pays====\nTerrorists are predisposed to attribute success to their technique whenever plausible (62\u201364). Pape claims that \"recent suicide terrorist campaigns ... are associated with gains for the terrorists' political causes about half the time\" (64\u201365). Hamas's success is difficult to evaluate, but Hamas spokespersons express belief in their own success (65\u201373). Terrorists learn from each other; the spread of the method is therefore neither irrational nor surprising (73\u201375). But suicide terrorism has failed \"to compel target democracies to abandon goals central to national wealth or security\" (75\u201376).\n\n===Part II: The Social Logic of Suicide Terrorism===\n\n====Chapter 6: Occupation and Religious Difference====\n\"[T]he taproot of suicide terrorism is nationalism\" not religion (79). It is \"an extreme strategy for national liberation\" (80). This explains how the local community can be persuaded to re-define acts of suicide and murder as acts of martyrdom on behalf of the community (81\u201383). Pape proposes a nationalist theory of suicide terrorism, seen from the point of view of terrorists. He analyzes the notions of occupation (83\u201384), homeland (84\u201385), identity (85\u201387), religious difference as a contributor to a sense of \"alien\" occupation (87\u201388), foreign occupation reverses the relative importance of religion and language (88\u201392), and the widespread perception of the method as a \"last resort\" (92\u201394). A statistical demonstration leads to the conclusion that a \"linear\" rather than \"self-reinforcing spiral\" explanation of suicide terrorism is best (94\u2013100). However, different future developments of the phenomenon of suicide terrorism are very possible, and more study of the role of religion is needed (101).\n\n====Chapter 7: Demystifying al-Qaeda====\nWith increasing knowledge of al-Qaeda, we see that \"the presence of American military forces for combat operations on the homeland territory of the suicide terrorists is stronger than Islamic fundamentalism in predicting whether individuals from that country will become al-Qaeda suicide terrorists\" (103). \"Al-Qaeda is less a transnational network of like-minded ideologues ... than a cross-national military alliance of national liberation movements working together against what they see as a common imperial threat\" (104). The nature of Salafism, a Sunni form of Islamic fundamentalism, is complex (105\u201307). Statistical analysis fails to corroborate Salafism-terrorism connection, but it does corroborate a connection to U.S. military policies in the Persian Gulf (107\u201317). Al-Qaeda propaganda emphasizes the \"Crusader\" theme, which is inherently related to occupation (117\u201324). Pape concludes that \"the core features of al-Qaeda\" are captured by his theory (125).\n\n====Chapter 8: Suicide Terrorist Organizations around the Globe====\nRobert Pape examines other campaigns to see if the \"dynamics that make religious difference important\" are present in other terrorist campaigns, acknowledging the difficulty of the inquiry (126\u201329). He offers detailed analyses of Lebanon (129\u201339), Sri Lanka (139\u201354), the Sikhs in Punjab (154\u201362), and the Kurdish PKK in Turkey (162\u201366). His conclusion: \"Religion plays a role in suicide terrorism, but mainly in the context of national resistance\" and not Islam per se but \"the dynamics of religious difference\" are what matter (166\u201367).\n\n===Part III: The Individual Logic of Suicide Terrorism===\n\n====Chapter 9: Altruism and Terrorism====\nPape presents a Durkheimian analysis of suicide (173\u201379). \"Many acts of suicide terrorism are a murderous form of what Durkheim calls altruistic suicide\" (179). Analytical difficulties are acknowledged (180\u201381). Pape uses suicide rates in general as points of comparison (181\u201384). Team suicide, which is frequent in suicide terrorism, is an indicator of altruistic suicide, he argues (185\u201387). Altruistic suicide is a socially constructed phenomenon (187\u201388): e.g., Hezbollah in Lebanon (188\u201391), Hamas (191\u201393), Tamil Tigers (193\u201395); al-Qaeda (195\u201396). The altruistic nature of suicide terrorism suggests the number of potential terrorists is large, that suicide terrorism is capable of growing in attractiveness and appeal, and that any attempt at profiling will miss a substantial number of potential suicide terrorists (197\u201398).\n\n====Chapter 10: The Demographic Profile of Suicide Terrorists====\n\"In general, suicide attackers are rarely socially isolated, clinically insane, or economically destitute individuals, but are most often educated, socially integrated, and highly capable people who could be expected to have a good future\" (200). Pape discusses problems of data-gathering (201\u201302). He establishes 462 individuals in his \"universe\" of suicide terrorists available for analytical purposes (203). Hezbollah suicide bombers in the period 1982\u20131986 were 71% Communist\/Socialist, 21% Islamist, 8% Christian (204\u201307). In general, suicide terrorists are in their early 20s (207\u201308). Females are fewer in Islamist groups: \"Islamist fundamentalism may actually reduce the number of suicide terrorists by discouraging certain categories of individuals\" (208\u201309). Female suicide terrorists tend to be older than male (209\u201310). There is no documented mental illness in any case of suicide terrorism, though there are 16 cases of personal trauma (e.g., the loss of a loved one) (210\u201311). Arab suicide terrorists are in general better educated than average and are from the working or middle classes (211\u201316). \"[T]hey resemble the kind of politically conscious individuals who might join a grassroots movement more than they do wayward adolescents or religious fanatics\" (216).\n\n====Chapter 11: Portraits of Three Suicide Terrorists====\nEarlier work has tended to emphasize suicide terrorists' irrationality, but this generalization fit 1980s data better than more recent data (217\u201320). Pape looks at three individual cases: Mohamed Atta (220\u201326); Dhanu, a young woman from Jaffna, \"the most famous Tamil Tiger suicide bomber\" (226\u201330); and Saeed Hotari, of Hamas (231\u201334).\n\n===Conclusion===\n\n====Chapter 12: A New Strategy for Victory====\nThough \"we\" cannot leave the Middle East altogether, Pape asserts, a \"strategy for victory\" is available (237\u201338). U.S. should define victory as the separate objectives of \"defeating the current pool of terrorists\" and preventing a new generation from arising (238\u201339). He rejects Frum-Perle view that the root of the problem is in Islam (241\u201344). \"Rather, the taproot is American military policy\" (244). The notion that Islamic fundamentalism is bent on world domination is \"pure fantasy\" (244\u201345). An attempt by the West to force Muslim societies to transform \"is likely to dramatically increase the threat we face\" (245). He calls for a policy of \"'off-shore' balancing\": establishing local alliances while maintaining the capacity for rapid deployment of military forces (247\u201350).\n\n===Appendices===\n\n====Appendix I: Suicide Terrorist Campaigns, 1980\u20132003====\nAnalysis of 18 campaigns.\n\n====Appendix II: Occupations by Democratic States, 1980\u20132003====\nFifty-eight occupations by democratic states are listed (265\u201367).\n\n====Appendix III: Salafism in Major Sunni Muslim Majority Countries====\nThirty-four countries with Sunni majority populations of 1\u00a0m or more and the importance of Salafism in these countries are the subjects of brief commentaries. Salafism is defined as \"the belief that society should be organized according to the Quran and Sunna only\" (269). Sunni Countries with Salafi-Influenced Populations: Afghanistan (10\u00a0m Pashtuns); Algeria (19\u00a0m\/31m Sunni Muslims); Bangladesh (14\u00a0m\/114m); Egypt (23\u00a0m\/62m); Indonesia (26\u00a0m\/185m); Jordan (2\u00a0m\/6m); Nigeria (37\u00a0m\/68m); Oman (2\u00a0m\/2m); Pakistan (43\u00a0m\/149m); Saudi Arabia (18\u00a0m\/18m); Somalia (5\u00a0m\/10m); Sudan (21\u00a0m\/21m); Tunisia (5\u00a0m\/10m); Yemen (8\u00a0m\/11m) (270\u201374). Non-Salafi Sunni Countries: Albania, Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Libya, Malaysia, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan (274\u201377).\n\n==Critiques==\n\nIn a criticism of Pape's link between occupation and suicide terrorism, an article titled \"Design, Inference, and the Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism\" (published in The American Political Science Review), authors Scott Ashworth, Joshua D. Clinton, Adam Meirowitz, and Kristopher W. Ramsay from Princeton charge Pape with \"sampling on the dependent variable\" by limiting research only to cases in which suicide terror was used: Pape's analysis has no control group. Appendix II lists 58 occupations by democracies, only 9 of which generated suicide terrorism. An analysis explaining the difference between the 9 with suicide terrorism and the 49 without is lacking.\n\nIn response, Pape argues that his research design is sufficient because it collected the universe of known cases of suicide terrorism. In a rejoinder, Ashworth et al. discuss how even large samples of the dependent variable cannot be used to explain variation in outcomes, why suicide terrorism in some places but not others, if the sample does not vary.\n\nIn a debate hosted by the Washington Institute, Martin Kramer argued that Pape's thesis was less relevant to Al Qaeda than to Lebanon and Palestine and that there were only 12,000 American troops in Saudi Arabia in 2001 and they had not caused any deaths. In response Pape argued that \"The U.S.-led war on terrorism is going badly because it is being waged on a faulty premise. That premise is that suicide terrorism is mainly a product of Islamic fundamentalism.\"\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n*  Downloadable audio interview with Scott Horton\n*  Chicago Project on Security and Threats\n*  It's the Occupation Stupid by Robert A.

{"title":"Sea Tigers","article":"The Sea Tigers (Tamil: \u0b95\u0b9f\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc1\u0bb2\u0bbf\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd Ka\u0163a\u1e5bpulika\u1e37) was the naval wing of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam during the Sri Lankan Civil War. It was founded in 1984. The Sea Tigers had a number of small but effective suicide bomber vessels. During its existence it had gained a reputation as a capable adversary for the Sri Lankan Navy. Over the years the Sea Tigers had sunk at least 29 Sri Lankan small inshore patrol boats and one freighter.\n\nThe Sea Tigers were led by Soosai, with their main base at Mullaitivu, on the north-eastern coast of Sri Lanka and their last base was taken when the Sri Lanka Army captured Chalai in Mullaitivu in February 2009.\n\n==Background==\n\nAs the Tamil insurgency gained strength, the LTTE required that much of its supplies to be smuggled in by sea. It was soon realized that a naval component was needed to complement the land-based guerrilla forces. The leader of the LTTE, Velupillai Prabhakaran, understood the necessity of a naval force.\n\nThe Sea Tigers were officially founded in 1984. In the first years its primary task was smuggling personnel and equipment between the LTTE's bases in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka, in particular Jaffna. As the Sea Tiger cadres gained experience, it took on offensive operations against the Sri Lankan Navy.\n\nThe leader, 'Admiral', of the Sea Tigers was said to be Soosai. The strategic implementation and execution of Sea Tiger military tactics were guided by leading senior cadre tacticians such as Lieutenant Commander Sri Ram.\n\n==Major operations==\nDuring several of the LTTE offensive campaigns the Sea Tigers landed troops to engage and distract Sri Lankan Army units; the latest was when the LTTE attacked the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal faction in the east in 2004. The most significant use of combined operations was at the Second Battle of Elephant Pass in the Spring of 2000, when some 2,500 cadres were landed behind enemy lines. Previously the largest such operation was the capture of Mullaitivu in 1996, the Sri Lanka Army losing over 1,200 soldiers with all their equipment. The LTTE admitted that during that operation the LTTE lost 330 personnel.\n\nIn 2001 The Sri Lankan Navy launched the Operation \"Varuna Kirana\" to stop LTTE sea tiger convoys which bring weapons and equipment from LTTE smuggling ships in the deep seas to land. However this was ultimately unsuccessful as the Navy units were spread out and when they encountered LTTE convoys navy units were vastly outnumbered, often with ten or fifteen Sea Tiger boats against their two Dvoras. The sea tigers also benefitted from weak intelligence gathering by the navy and the poor communications between the navy and the air force.\n\nSea Tigers' fast patrol boats and smaller suicide boats had engaged and sunk around 29 Sri Lanka Navy fast patrol boats. They also attacked the main SLN naval base in a suicide bomber vessel mission at Trincomalee and damaged one of the two SLN catamarans used as troop transports.\n\nOn October 20, 2006, the Sri Lankan Navy reported that it had sunk 9 Sea Tigers boats, and damaged several others in a major skirmish which reportedly left 171 rebels dead.\n\nOn November 1, 2008, a sea battle occurred between Sri Lankan navy and Sea Tigers. During the initial attack at about 05:45 seven Black Sea Tigers died, while four LTTE attack craft were destroyed, 14 Tamil Tigers were killed and about as many others were reported injured. The Sea Tigers then intercepted a twenty-vessel strong Sri Lankan Navy flotilla escorting a hovercraft that resulted in a heavy sea fight. According to pro-rebel sources, at about 7:00 After losing a Dvora Fast Attack Craft (FAC) and the hovercraft, the Lankan navy was forced to withdraw, and had to tow a Water Jet naval craft that was severely damaged to the Kangkeasanthu'rai (KKS) naval base. The battle followed reports that the Sri Lanka's air force had claimed to have bombed a base of the Sea Tiger chief, Soosai and captured a Sea Tiger base at Nachchikuda, along the north-western seaboard. The Sri Lanka Army launched heavy artillery barrages across the Northern Front following the sea battle. The attack also followed a dual Air Tiger air attack.\n\n== Demise ==\nAfter 2005 the Sri Lankan Navy had undergone several major reforms and unlike in the past the navy received more political support. Thus with the beginning of the Fourth Eelam War the Sea Tigers faced a more organised enemy adapted to asymmetric warfare. Development of the navy's intelligence wing and centralizing intelligence agencies allowed the government to track LTTE smuggling ships and instead of attempting stop convoys bringing weapons ashore the navy attacked smuggling ships. Initially stopping at 200 nautical miles to unload cargo to smaller boats, the LTTE was forced to carry out operations further away due to loss of ships and in 2007 SLN followed and sank them near Australian territory. During naval engagements the Sea tigers who relied on swarming and suicide boats found themselves outnumbered due to the introduction of the Arrow-class which was of higher quality When the LTTE used the standard tactic of swarming larger patrol vessels the SLN would fall back while the confused Sea Tiger units are swarmed by arrow boats and outnumbered 10 to 40. The use of sonars alongside simpler methods such as booms alongside increased patrols around ports countered frogmen actions.\n\nThe Sea Tiger force was annihilated during April 2009 attack by Sri Lanka Army and on May 18, 2009 the Sri Lankan government confirmed that Colonel Soosai was killed when a rocket hit the armored-plated van he was travelling in. As a result of the military offensive that ended in May 2009, in the North of the country the Sri Lanka Armed Forces first recaptured all of the western seaboard that was once controlled by the LTTE, thus depriving the Sea Tigers the bases it had in the west.\n\nOn the eastern seaboard the LTTE has also lost all of its Sea tigers bases and coast line it controlled including the headquarters of the Sea Tigers in the town of Mullaitivu.\n\nAlthough the Sea Tigers were initially able to put up stout resistance as several major sea engagements have occurred in the early months of 2009 with the Sea tigers trying to penetrate the naval blockade maintained by the Sri Lanka Navy in the eastern seaboard, they have now been virtually eliminated as an organized naval force. On land the Sri Lanka Army has been able to capture several Sea Tiger boats and a boat yard including several partially completed submersibles.\n\nIn early February 2009, the military reported once again that it captured the last major Sea Tiger base killing three senior commanders in the process thus limiting Sea Tiger operational capabilities. As of 16 May 2009, the entire Sri Lankan coastline was captured by the Sri Lankan Armed Forces. Currently, the Sea Tigers are presumed to have been effectively and completely destroyed.\n\n==Units==\n\n===Boats===\nBoats used by the LTTE are divided into Gunboats, Explosive Boats and Low Profile Vessels. Boats designs ranged from those based on leisure to fishing craft.These boats could be up to 15 meters long, and were usually equipped with four to six 250 Hp outboard engines and a mixture of weaponry: light and heavy machine guns mainly of 12.7mm, 14.7mm calibers and grenade launchers. While inferior to the patrol craft of the navy the use of swarm tactics together with suicide boats negated the disadvantage. The Sea Tiger attack vessels are only at sea during operations and training; when idle they are loaded on large trailers and hidden in the dense jungle southwest of Mullaitivu  or even transported to the west coast if needed. They were also said to possess radar evading stealth boats which are believed to be from North Korea. While their radar evading capabilities have been questioned their low profile makes them harder to spot.\n\nLight fibreglass boats were used for suicide bomber attacks. For every 20 Gunboats in a swarm there were 3 or 4 suicide craft which attempt to destroy or at least immobilize the larger vessels while gunboats distract them. The LTTE also manufactured several Low Profile Vessels which are slower than other boats but stealthier.\n\n===Ships===\nThe Sea Tigers also manned a number of larger merchant vessels (sailing under various flags) used for smuggling equipment from neighboring countries. As there were no large ports under LTTE control, the supplies were loaded onto smaller vessels that could land directly on the beaches. From March 2003 to October 2007, the Sri Lankan Navy destroyed ten of these vessels in the Indian Ocean, crippling the LTTE's supply line.\n\n=== Submersibles ===\nThe LTTE built several crudely built submersibles and semi-submersibles based on Narco-sub designs. All designs were unarmed but some had long nose spars to ram vessels.\n\n===Frogmen===\nFrogmen also served with the Sea Tigers and were used in sinking at least one freighter at the Sri Lankan Navy base at Kankesanturai - KKS, at the northern point of the Jaffna peninsula. They were also involved in the sinking of a SLN supply ship in Trincomalee harbor in May 2008.\n\nOn 17 June 2006 on the coast near Colombo, two frogmen belonging to the Sea Tigers were captured by Sri Lanka's army while trying to bomb ships in Colombo Port. News images showed that the frogmen were using rebreathers, probably a type with one oxygen cylinder across the belly. On capture, both tried to commit suicide using cyanide.\n\n=== Naval Mines ===\nThe LTTE developed several types of improvised naval mines including moored, floating and limpet mines. The LTTE used smuggled  torpedoes to construct mines as their boats were unable to use torpedoes.\n\n===Personnel===\nThe total personnel strength was between 2,000-3,000 women and men. Women operated the boats on an equal footing as their male compatriots. However the number of personnel may vary depending on operational needs. Local arms caches were hidden in the jungle close to villages.\n\n==Analysts' views of Sea Tigers==\n\n\n\nJane's International Defence Review, in a report on Sri Lanka, published a few years ago, pointed out that the Sea Tigers \"have taken on the Sri Lankan navy with unprecedented success.\" A recent publication of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs for the Centre for Strategic and International Studies reckons that they have destroyed 30 per cent of Sri Lanka's navy fiberglass small craft fleet.\n\nThe Sea Tigers not relying on communications with their command on shore during ongoing operations, was one factor in their success. The Sri Lankan Navy on the other hand was required to act in accordance with commanders onshore. Sea Tiger intelligence also played a key role in their operations, allowing for detailed and bold operations to be carried out in almost silent mode (highest EMCON).\n\nThe basis of Sea Tiger offensive operations could be described as sea control and keeping the SLN on their toes with their extensive sea denial tactics in the northern waters of Sri Lanka. Some analysts say the Sea Tigers have adopted the military theory of 'Versatile Maritime Force'. Sea Tiger operations could also be seen as a clear example of asymmetric warfare.\n\n==Strategic implications==\n\n===India===\nIndia regarded the Sea Tigers as a \"nuisance\" in South Asian waters and the Indian Armed Forces and Tamil Nadu's state government had increased naval surveillance in the region. Though no clashes were reported between the Sea Tigers and Indian civil or military ships, Indian experts have suggested the government to \"neutralize\" it as the ongoing battle between the Tigers and Sri Lankan Navy has affected Indian fishing areas and shipping lanes.\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nThe LTTE once controlled parts of the northern coastline of Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan forces stationed in the Jaffna peninsula were mainly supplied through naval convoys from Trincomalee in the east. The Sea Tigers bases were well located for attacks on these shipments, and forces the SLN to keep a significant force of fast attack patrol-boats on alert. Sea Tigers have also captured and seized the cargo of at least two Sri Lankan freighters. \n \nIn many ways the Sea Tigers had adapted and challenged a larger and more modern Navy, due to their tactics being based on the understanding of SLN operations cycles, doctrine and reaction time.\n\n==Human rights abuses==\n\n===Sea piracy===\nThe Sea Tigers are accused of hijacking ships and boats of all sizes.\n\nThe Sea Tigers has been accused of hijacking several vessels in waters outside Sri Lanka including the Irish Mona (in August 1995), Princess Wave (in August 1996), Athena (in May 1997), Misen (in July 1997), Morong Bong (in July 1997), MV Cordiality (in Sept 1997) and Princess Kash (in August 1998).\n\nWhen the LTTE captured the MV Cordiality near the port of Trincomalee, they killed all five Chinese crew members on board. The MV Sik Yang, a 2,818-ton Malaysian-flag cargo ship which sailed from Tuticorin, India on May 25, 1999 was reported missing in waters near Sri Lanka. The ship with a cargo of bagged salt was due at the Malaysian port of Malacca on May 31. The fate of the ship's crew of 63 is unknown. It is suspected that the vessel was hijacked by the LTTE, the crew thrown overboard, and is now been used as a phantom vessel. A report published on June 30, 1999 confirmed that the vessel had been hijacked by the LTTE.\n\nIn a notable incident since the signing of the Ceasefire Agreement in 2001, the crew of a Jordanian ship, MV Farah III that ran aground near rebel-controlled territory off the island's coast, accused the Tamil Tigers of forcing them to abandon the vessel which was carrying 14,000 tonnes of Indian rice and risking their lives. The crew said that LTTE fired four times to force them out of the vessel after failing to explode it in choppy seas three days after. The skipper of the vessel said; \"First they tried to set up a bomb and explode the anchor cable and when it failed they ordered us to weigh anchor\" He also said that the Tigers dismantled and removed all radio communication equipment and radar from the vessel. On May 1, 2007 Sayed Sulaiman, the chairman of the ship's owners, Salam International Trading Company gave an interview to the BBC Tamil service, saying, \"We hear from the parties who are concerned with the ship, the insurance company etc., that ... everything that could be taken \u2013 like the rice, lights, generators \u2013 has been taken from the ship. The ship is now bare.\" \n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n*  Article in \"Janes\" about the Sea Tiger sinking of a SLN catamaran in Trincomalee\n*  Article in \"Janes\" about the Sea Tigers'tactics and technology\n*  Article in \"The Hindu\" - Sea Tigers as a possible threat to India's security\n*  Article in the GOSL website regarding the \"Chinese trawler incident\"\n*  BBC report about the \"Chinese trawler incident\"\n*  Pictorial of Sea Tigers parade to pay tribute to their fallen fellow cadres on the Martyr's day memorial held in Kallapadu, Mullaithivu coast Nov 2005, a blog\n*  Overview of the Sea Tiger attack on \"Pearl Cruise\" on 11.

{"title":"Leonidas Squadron","article":"The 'Leonidas Squadron', formally known as 5th Staffel of Kampfgeschwader 200, was a unit which was originally formed to fly the Fieseler Fi 103R (Reichenberg), a manned version of the V-1 flying bomb, in attacks in which the pilot was likely to be killed, or at best to parachute down at the attack site. The Reichenberg was never used in combat because Werner Baumbach, the commander of KG 200, and his superiors considered it an unnecessary waste of life and resources, and preferred instead to use the Mistel composite aircraft aerial ordnance system instead.  The Mistel composite design was piloted from a regular Luftwaffe single-seat fighter used as the \"upper component\" forming the guidance system, mounted as an integral parasite aircraft, as the only manned part, mounted atop the unmanned, shaped charge-nosed \"expendable lower component\" of the Mistel aircraft system, as in its target dive, the single-seat pilot released the lower, unmanned flying bomb component aircraft towards its target, while the upper component, manned fighter \"guidance component\" returned to base.\n\n==History==\nThe establishment of a suicide squadron (staffel) was originally proposed by Otto Skorzeny and Hajo Herrmann. The proposal was supported by noted test pilot Hanna Reitsch. The idea proposed was that Germany would use volunteers as suicide pilots in order to overcome the Allies' numerical advantages with their fanatic spirit. The idea had roots in German mythology that was glorified by Nazi propaganda. Hitler was reluctant, but eventually agreed to Reitsch's request to establish and train a suicide attack air unit, with the proviso that it would not be operated in combat without his approval. The new unit, nicknamed the \"Leonidas Squadron\", became part of KG 200. It was named after Leonidas I, king of Sparta, who in 480 BC, after realizing that he was being flanked, dismissed the bulk of his army and resisted the invading Persian army at the Battle of Thermopylae with 1400 warriors who fought to the last man against 100,000 Persians.\n\nReitsch's plan was to attack Allied invasion shipping using the Messerschmitt Me 328 as a suicide weapon which would dive into the sea underneath ships and explode a  bomb. Heinrich Himmler approved the idea, and suggested using convicted criminals as pilots. The Luftwaffe's High Command was unenthusiastic; Erhard Milch turned the plan down as impractical, and Hermann G\u00f6ring showed little interest. Adolf Hitler was against the idea of self-sacrifice, believing that it was not in keeping with the German character, and furthermore did not see the war situation as being bad enough to require such extreme measures. Despite this, he allowed Reitsch to proceed with the project after she had shown the plan to him in February 1944. G\u00fcnther Korten, the Luftwaffe's head of general staff, gave the matter to the commander of KG 200 to deal with.\n\nOver 70 volunteers, mostly young recruits, came forward; they were required to sign a declaration which said, \"I hereby voluntarily apply to be enrolled in the suicide group as part of a human glider-bomb. I fully understand that employment in this capacity will entail my own death.\"\n\nProblems were experienced in converting the Me 328, and the decision was taken to use instead a manned version of the V-1 flying bomb, the Fieseler Fi 103R (Reichenberg); however, it never entered operation.\n\nOn 9 June 1944, Karl Koller announced that a group of KG-200s equipped with special Focke-Wulf Fw 190s was ready for \"total operations\". Each aircraft carried a heavy bomb, the weight of which meant that the machines could not carry enough fuel for a return flight. Thus the pilots were only trained using the aircraft as gliders. This project ultimately came to nothing, and Werner Baumbach, by then the commander of KG-200, persuaded his friend Albert Speer that it would be more productive to use the men against Russian power stations rather than against the Allied invasion fleet; Speer passed this on to Hitler.\n\n==Oder bridge attack missions, April 1945==\nDuring the Battle for Berlin, the Luftwaffe flew \"self-sacrifice missions\" (Selbstopfereins\u00e4tze) against Soviet-held bridges over the Oder River. These 'total missions' were flown by pilots of the Leonidas Squadron under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Heiner Lange from 17 April until 20 April 1945, using any aircraft that were available.  The Luftwaffe claimed that the squadron destroyed seventeen bridges.  However, the military historian Antony Beevor, writing about the incident, thinks that this was exaggerated and that only the railway bridge at K\u00fcstrin was definitely destroyed. Beevor comments that \"thirty-five pilots and aircraft was a high price to pay for such a limited and temporary success\". The missions were called off when the Soviet ground forces reached the vicinity of the squadron's airbase at J\u00fcterbog and were in a position to overrun it.\n\n== See also ==\n* Kamikaze\n* Sonderkommando Elbe\n* Suicide bombings\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Muller, Richard R.;  Losing air superiority: a case study from the Second World War originally published in Air & Space Power Journal,  Winter, 2003.

{"title":"TWA Flight 841 (1974)","article":"On September 8, 1974, a Boeing 707-331B (registered ) operating as TWA Flight 841 from Tel Aviv to New York City via Athens and Rome crashed into the Ionian Sea, killing all aboard. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the plane had been destroyed by a bomb hidden in the cargo hold. The detonation of the bomb destroyed the systems responsible for operating the plane's control surfaces, causing the plane to pitch up until it stalled and dove into the sea.\n\n==Background==\n\nAfter the ousting of the PLO from Jordan following the Jordanian-Palestinian civil war, the Palestinian military organizations made South Lebanon into their headquarters, enlisting militants from Palestinian refugee camps.  South Lebanon was also referred to as Fatahland, due to the almost complete control of Fatah and other military Palestinian organizations over this officially Lebanese area, which they used to stage attacks against Israel.\n\n==Events==\nThe airline's Tel Aviv office said 49 passengers boarded the plane there for Rome and the United States. They included 17 Americans (plus a baby), 13 Japanese, four Italians, four French, three Indians, two Iranians, two Israelis, two Sri Lankans, an Australian and a Canadian. The nationalities of 30 other passengers and the nine crew members were not immediately known at the time. Reuters reported a total of 37 Americans aboard. The crash occurred about 50 nautical miles west of Cephalonia, Greece.\n\nAfter stopping for 68 minutes in Athens, it departed for Rome. About 30 minutes after takeoff, the plane crashed into the Ionian Sea. The out-of-control aircraft was observed by crew on the flight deck of Pan Am Flight 110. They watched the aircraft execute a steep climb, followed by the separation of an engine from the wing and a death spiral. All 79 passengers and nine crew members were killed.\n\nIn Beirut, it was reported that a Palestinian youth organization claimed it had put a guerrilla on the plane with a bomb. However, a spokesman for TWA said sabotage was \"highly unlikely.\" Later, the National Transportation Safety Board determined that the plane was indeed destroyed by a bomb hidden in the cargo hold, which caused structural failure resulting in uncontrollable flight. The USS Independence along with the USS Biddle was tasked with picking up the debris and bodies.\n\nSuspicion fell on Abu Nidal and his terror organization.\n\nIn January 2009, the Associated Press published an investigation saying that Khalid Duhham Al-Jawary, responsible for the 1973 New York City bomb plot, was linked to the bombing of TWA Flight 841.\n\n==Maps==\n\n\n==Notes==\n*Barry Werth, 31 Days: Gerald Ford, The Nixon Pardon and a Government in Crisis (New York: Anchor Books). 2006. pp.\u00a0324\u20135 \n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n* AAR 75-07 Boeing 707 Ionian Sea Crash ( Alternate link,  Archive)\n*  Criminal Occurrence Description at the Aviation Safety Network","urls":["https:\/\/www.ntsb.gov\/investigations\/AccidentReports\/Reports\/AAR7507.pdf","http:\/\/www.airdisaster.com\/reports\/ntsb\/AAR75-07.pdf","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20121004122304\/http:\/\/www.airdisaster.com\/reports\/ntsb\/AAR75-07.pdf","http:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/news\/2009\/02\/26\/2009-02-26_terrorist_who_plotted_1973_car_bombs_kha.html"]}
{"title":"Suicide attack","article":"A suicide attack is any violent attack in which the attacker accepts their own death as a direct result of the method used to harm, damage, or destroy the target. Suicide attacks have occurred throughout history, often as part of a military campaign such as the Japanese kamikaze pilots of World War II, and more recently as part of terrorist campaigns, such as the September 11 attacks.\n\nWhile there were few, if any, successful suicide attacks anywhere in the world from the end of World War II until 1980, between 1981 and September 2015, a total of 4,814 suicide attacks occurred in over 40 countries, killing over 45,000 people.  During this time the global rate of such attacks grew from an average of three a year in the 1980s, to about one a month in the 1990s, to almost one a week from 2001 to 2003, to approximately one a day from 2003 to 2015.\n\nSuicide attacks tend to be more deadly and destructive than other terror attacks because they give their perpetrators the ability to conceal weapons, make last-minute adjustments, and because they dispense with the need for remote or delayed detonation, escape plans or rescue teams.  They constituted only 4% of all terrorist attacks around the world over one period (between 1981 and 2006), but caused 32% of all terrorism-related deaths (14,599). Ninety percent of those attacks occurred in Afghanistan, Iraq, Israel, the Palestinian territories, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Overall, as of mid-2015 about three-quarters of all suicide attacks occurred in just three countries: Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq.\n\nSuicide attacks have been described as a weapon of psychological warfare to instill fear in the target population, a strategy to eliminate or at least drastically diminish areas where the public feels safe, and the \"fabric of trust that holds societies together\", as well as demonstrate the lengths to which perpetrators will go to achieve their goals.\n\nThe motivation of suicide attackers varies. Kamikaze acted under military orders and were motivated by obedience and nationalism. Before 2003, most attacks targeted forces occupying the attackers' homeland, according to analyst Robert Pape. Anthropologist Scott Atran states that since 2004 the overwhelming majority of bombers have been motivated by the ideology of Islamist martyrdom.\n\n==Definitions==\n\n===Terrorism===\nSuicide attacks include both suicide terrorism\u2014terrorism often defined as any action \"intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants\" for the purpose of intimidation\u2014and suicide attacks not targeting non-combatants. An alternative definition is provided by Jason Burke, a journalist who has lived among Islamic militants, and suggests that most define terrorism as 'the use or threat of serious violence' to advance some kind of 'cause', stressing that terrorism is a tactic.  Academic Fred Halliday, has written that assigning the descriptor of 'terrorist' or 'terrorism' to the actions of a group is a tactic used by states to deny 'legitimacy' and 'rights to protest and rebel'.\n\n===Suicide terrorism===\n\nThe definition of \"suicide\" is another issue. Suicide terrorism itself has been defined by professor of Government Ami Pedahzur as \"violent actions perpetrated by people who are aware that the odds they will return alive are close to zero\".\nOther sources exclude from their work \"suicidal\" or high risk attacks, such as the Lod Airport massacre or \"reckless charge in battle\",  focusing only on true \"suicide attacks\", where the odds of survival are not \"close to zero\" but required to be zero, because \"the perpetrator's ensured death is a precondition for the success of his mission\".\n\nAlso excluded from the definition are \"proxy bombings\", which may have political goals and may be designed to look like suicide bombing, but where the \"proxy\" is forced to carry a bomb under threat (such as having their children killed; and  \"suicidal rampage shootings\" (such as the Columbine High School massacre,  the Virginia Tech shooting or Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in the U.S.) which are usually thought of as being driven by personal and psychological reasons, not political, social or religious, motives.\n\nIt may not always be clear to investigators which type of killing is which. Suicide attack campaigns sometimes also using proxy bombers (as alleged in Iraq). or manipulating the vulnerable to be bombers, At least one researcher (Adam Lankford) argues that the motivation to kill and be killed connects some suicide attackers more closely to \"suicidal rampage\" murderers than is commonly thought.\n\n===Usage===\nThe usage of the term \"suicide attack\" goes back a long way but \"suicide bombing\" dates back to at least 1940 when a New York Times article mentions the term in relation to German tactics. Less than two years later that newspaper referred to a Japanese kamikaze attempt on an American carrier as a \"suicide bombing\". In 1945 The Times of London, referred to a kamikaze plane as a \"suicide-bomb\", and two years later an article there referred to a new British pilot-less, radio-controlled rocket missile as originally designed \"as a counter-measure to the Japanese 'suicide-bomber'\".\n\n====Alternative terms====\nSometimes, to assign either a more positive or negative connotation to the act, suicide bombing is referred to by different terms.\n\n;Istishhad\n\nIslamist supporters often call a suicide attack Istishhad (often translated as \"martyrdom operation\"), and the suicide attacker shahid (pl. shuhada, literally 'witness' and usually translated as 'martyr'). The idea being that the attacker died in order to testify his faith in God, for example while waging jihad bis saif (jihad by the sword). The term \"suicide\" is never used because Islam has strong strictures against taking one's own life. The terms Istishhad \/ \"martyrdom operation\" have been embraced by the Palestinian Authority, and by Hamas, Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, Fatah and other Palestinian factions.\n\n;Homicide bombing\nSome efforts have been made to replace the term \"suicide bombing\" with \"homicide bombing\", on the grounds that since the primary purpose of such a bombing is to kill other people, homicide is a more apt adjective than \"suicide\".\n\nThe first to use the term for a wide audience was White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer in April 2002. The only major media outlets to use it were Fox News Channel and the New York Post (both of which are owned by News Corporation and have since mostly abandoned the term).\n\nEmeritus Professor Robert Goldney, of the University of Adelaide, has argued in favor of the term \"homicide bomber\", arguing that studies show that there is little in common between people who blow themselves up, intending to kill as many people as possible in the process, and actual suicide victims. Fox News producer Dennis Murray argued that a suicidal act should be reserved for a person who does something to kill themselves only. CNN Producer Christa Robinson argued that the term \"homicide bomber\" reflects only that you have killed other people, but not that you have also killed yourself.\n\n;Genocide bombing\n\"Genocide bombing\" was coined in 2002 by Irwin Cotler, a member of the Canadian parliament, in an effort to focus attention on the alleged intention of genocide by militant Palestinians in their calls to \"wipe Israel off the map\".\n\n;Sacrifice bombing\nIn the German-speaking area the term \"sacrifice bombing\" (Ger. Opferanschlag) was proposed in 2012 by German scholar Arata Takeda. The term is intended to shift the focus away from the suicide of the perpetrators and towards their use as weapons by their commanders.\n\n==History, pre-1980==\nThe 1st Century AD Jewish Sicarii sect are thought to have carried out suicidal attacks against Hellenized Jews they considered immoral collaborators. The Hashishiyeen (Assassins) sect of Ismaili Shi'a Muslims assassinated two caliphs, and many viziers, sultans and Crusader leaders over the course of 300 years, before being annihilated by Mongol invaders.  Hashishiyeen were known for their targeting of the powerful, their use of the dagger as a weapon (rather than something safer for the assassin such as a crossbow), and for making no attempt to escape after completing their killing. However, this is disputed by non-orientalist scholars who claimed that unlike the Ninja\/Shinobi, the Assassins always avoided suicide unless it was absolutely necessary, and preferred to be killed by their captors.\n\nArnold von Winkelried became a hero in the Swiss struggle for independence when he sacrificed himself at the Battle of Sempach in 1386.\n\nThe earliest known non-military suicide attack occurred in Murchison in New Zealand on 14 July 1905. A long-standing dispute between two farmers resulted in a court case, and the defendant (Joseph Sewell) had sticks of gelignite strapped to his body. When Sewell excitedly shouted during the court sitting about the other farmer \"I'll blow the devil to hell, and I have enough dynamite to do just that\", he was ushered out of the building. Sewell detonated the charge when a police officer tried to arrest him on the street, and his body was blown to pieces, but nobody else died from their injuries.\n\n===India===\n\nIn 1780 a woman commander by the name Kuyili, applied ghee and oil, set herself ablaze and jumped into the armoury of the British, securing victory for Velu Nachiyar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n===Dutch===\nIn the late 17th century, Qing official Yu Yonghe recorded that injured Dutch soldiers fighting against Koxinga's forces for control of Taiwan in 1661 would use gunpowder to blow up both themselves and their opponents rather than be taken prisoner. However, the Chinese observer may have confused such suicidal tactics with the standard Dutch military practice of undermining and blowing up positions recently overrun by the enemy which almost cost Koxinga his life during the Siege of Fort Zeelandia.\n\n===Aceh===\nMuslim Acehnese from the Aceh Sultanate performed suicide attacks known as Parang-sabil against Dutch invaders during the Aceh War. It was considered as part of personal jihad in the Islamic religion of the Acehnese. The Dutch called it Atj\u00e8h-moord, (literally \"Aceh-murder\"). The Acehnese work of literature, the Hikayat Perang Sabil provided the background and reasoning for the \"Aceh-mord\"\u2014 Acehnese suicide attacks upon the Dutch. The Indonesian translations of the Dutch terms are Aceh bodoh (Aceh pungo) or Aceh gila (Aceh mord).\n\nAtj\u00e8h-moord was also used against the Japanese by the Acehnese during the Japanese occupation of Aceh. The Acehnese Ulama (Islamic clerics) fought against both the Dutch and the Japanese, revolting against the Dutch in February 1942 and against Japan in November 1942. The revolt was led by the All-Aceh Religious Scholars' Association (PUSA). The Japanese suffered 18 dead in the uprising while they slaughtered up to 100 or over 120 Acehnese. The revolt happened in Bayu and was centred around Tjot Plieng village's religious school. During the revolt, the Japanese troops armed with mortars and machine guns were charged by sword wielding Acehnese under Teungku Abduldjalil (Tengku Abdul Djalil) in Buloh Gampong Teungah and Tjot Plieng on 10 and 13 November. In May 1945 the Acehnese rebelled again.\n\n===Moro Juramentado===\n\nMoro Muslims who performed suicide attacks were called mag-sabil, and the suicide attacks were known as Parang-sabil. The Spanish called them juramentado. The idea of the juramentado was considered part of jihad in the Moros' Islamic religion. During an attack, a Juramentado would throw himself at his targets and kill them with bladed weapons such as barongs and kris until he himself was killed. The Moros performed juramentado suicide attacks against the Spanish in the Spanish\u2013Moro conflict of the 16th to the 19th centuries, against the Americans in the Moro Rebellion (1899\u20131913), and against the Japanese in World War II.\n\nThe Moro Juramentados aimed their attacks specifically against their enemies, and not against non-Muslims in general. They launched suicide attacks on the Japanese, Spanish, Americans and Filipinos, but did not attack the non-Muslim Chinese as the Chinese were not considered enemies of the Moro people. The Japanese responded to these suicide attacks by massacring all known family members and relatives of the attacker(s).\n\nAccording to historian Stephan Dale, the Moro were not the only Muslims who carried out suicide attacks \"in their fight against Western hegemony and colonial rule\".  In the 18th century, suicide tactics were used on the Malabar coast of Southwestern India, in Atjeh (Acheh) in Northern Sumatra as well.\n\n===Russia===\nThe first known suicide bomber was Russian.  The invention of dynamite in the 1860s presented revolutionary and terrorist groups in Europe with a weapon nearly 20 times more powerful than gunpowder, but with technical challenges to detonating it at the right time. One way around that obstacle was to use a human trigger, and this was the technique that assassinated Tsar Alexander II of Russia in 1881.\n A would-be suicide-bomber killed Vyacheslav von Plehve, the Russian Minister of the Interior, in St Petersburg in 1904.\n\nThe German invasion of Russia in Operation Barbarossa wrong-footed Soviet commanders. In a desperate bid to stem the surging tide of German troops deep in to Soviet territory, Russian commanders instructed their fighter pilots to crash their planes into those of enemy. One of those was a female pilot named Yekaterina Zelenko, who brought down a Messerschmit fighter with her plane, the only woman to have performed a ramming mission in the war, and arguably making her the first female suicide bomber in history.\n\n===Chinese suicide squads===\n\nDuring the Xinhai Revolution (the Revolution of 1911) and the Warlord Era of the Republic of China (1912\u20131949), \"Dare to Die Corps\" or \"Suicide squads\" were frequently used by Chinese armies. China deployed these suicide units against the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War.\n\nIn the Xinhai Revolution, many Chinese revolutionaries became martyrs in battle. \"Dare to Die\" student corps were founded, for student revolutionaries wanting to fight against Qing dynasty rule. Dr. Sun Yatsen and Huang Xing promoted the Dare to Die corps. Huang said, \"We must die, so let us die bravely.\" Suicide squads were formed by Chinese students going into battle, knowing that they would be killed fighting against overwhelming odds.\n\nThe 72 Martyrs of Huanghuagang died in the uprising that began the Wuchang Uprising, and were recognized as heroes and martyrs by the Kuomintang party and the Republic of China. The martyrs in the Dare to Die Corps who died in battle wrote letters to family members before heading off to certain death. The Huanghuakang was built as a monument to the 72 martyrs. The deaths of the revolutionaries helped the establishment of the Republic of China, overthrowing the Qing dynasty imperial system. Other Dare to Die student corps in the Xinhai revolution were led by students who later became major military leaders in Republic of China, like Chiang Kai-shek, and Huang Shaoxiong with the Muslim Bai Chongxi against Qing dynasty forces.\n\"Dare to Die\" troops were used by warlords.  The Kuomintang used one to put down an insurrection in Canton. Many women joined them in addition to men to achieve martyrdom against China's opponents. They were known as \u70c8\u58eb \"Lit-she\" (Martyrs) after accomplishing their mission.\n\nDuring the January 28 Incident a dare to die squad struck against the Japanese.\n\nSuicide bombing was also used against the Japanese.  A \"dare to die corps\" was effectively used against Japanese units at the Battle of Taierzhuang. They used swords. They wore suicide vests made out of grenades.\n\nA Chinese soldier detonated a grenade vest and killed 20 Japanese soldiers at Sihang Warehouse. Chinese troops strapped explosives such as grenade packs or dynamite to their bodies and threw themselves under Japanese tanks to blow them up. This tactic was used during the Battle of Shanghai, to stop a Japanese tank column when an attacker exploded himself beneath the lead tank, and at the Battle of Taierzhuang where Chinese troops with dynamite and grenades strapped to themselves rushed Japanese tanks and blew themselves up,\nin one incident obliterating four Japanese tanks with grenade bundles.\n\nDuring the 1946\u20131950 Communist Revolution, coolies fighting the Communists formed \"Dare to Die Corps\" to fight for their organizations, with their lives. During the Tiananmen Square Incident of 1989, protesting students also formed \"Dare to Die Corps\", to risk their lives defending the protest leaders.\n\n===Japanese Kamikaze===\n\n\n\n\nKamikaze, a ritual act of self-sacrifice carried out by Japanese pilots of explosive-laden aircraft against Allied warships, occurred on a large scale at the end of World War II. About 3000 attacks were made and about 50 ships were sunk.\n\nLater in the war, as Japan became more desperate, this act became formalized and ritualized, as planes were outfitted with explosives specific to the task of a suicide mission. Kamikaze strikes were a weapon of asymmetric war used by the Empire of Japan against United States Navy and Royal Navy aircraft carriers, although the armoured flight deck of the Royal Navy carriers diminished Kamikaze effectiveness. The Japanese Navy also used piloted torpedoes called kaiten (\"Heaven shaker\") on suicide missions. Although sometimes called midget submarines, these were modified versions of the unmanned torpedoes of the time and are distinct from the torpedo-firing midget submarines used earlier in the war, which were designed to infiltrate shore defenses and return to a mother ship after firing their torpedoes. Although extremely hazardous, these midget submarine attacks were not technically suicide missions, as the earlier midget submarines had escape hatches. Kaitens, however, provided no means of escape.\n\n===Germans===\nDuring the Battle for Berlin the Luftwaffe flew \"Self-sacrifice missions\" (Selbstopfereinsatz) against Soviet bridges over the River Oder. These 'total missions' were flown by pilots of the Leonidas Squadron. From April 17\u201320, 1945, using any available aircraft, the  Luftwaffe claimed the squadron had destroyed 17 bridges, however military historian Antony Beevor when writing about the missions thinks that this was exaggerated and that only the railway bridge at K\u00fcstrin was definitely destroyed. He comments that \"thirty-five pilots and aircraft was a high price\nto pay for such a limited and temporary success\". The missions were called off when the Soviet ground forces reached the vicinity of the squadron's airbase at J\u00fcterbog.\n\nRudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff intended to assassinate Adolf Hitler by suicide bomb in 1943, but was unable to complete the attack.\n\n===Korean War===\nNorth Korean tanks were attacked by South Koreans with suicide tactics during the Korean War.\n\nAmerican tanks at Seoul were attacked by North Korean suicide squads, who used satchel charges. North Korean soldier Li Su-Bok is considered a hero for destroying an American tank with a suicide bomb.\n\n===Suez Crisis===\nAn Arab Christian military officer from Syria, Jules Jammal, allegedly brought down a French ship with a suicide attack during the Suez Crisis in 1956 according to Egyptian media, although both French ships with that name were unharmed during the crisis.\n\n===United States===\nOn December 27, 2018, the Green Bay Press-Gazette interviewed veteran Mark Bentley, who had trained for the Special Atomic Demolition Munition program to manually place and detonate a modified version of the W54 nuclear bomb. The report stated that he and other soldiers training for the program knew this was a suicide mission because either it would be unrealistic to outrun the timer on the bomb, or that soldiers would be obligated to secure the site before the timer went off. However, in theory the timer could be set long enough to give the team a chance to escape. Specifically, he stated, \"We all knew it was a one-way mission, a suicide mission.\" \"You set your timer, and it would click when it went off, or it went ding or I forget what, but you knew you were toast,\" he said. \"Ding! Your toast is ready, and it's you.\" He also commented, \"The Army is not going to set a bomb like that and run away and leave it, because they don't know if someone else would get ahold of it,\" he said. \"They have to leave troops there to make sure it's not stolen or compromised, and that would just be collateral damage. You didn't go out with the thought that it was anything other than a one-way mission. If you're Bruce Willis, you get away, but I ain't Bruce Willis.\"\n\n==Post-1980 attacks==\n\n===History===\n\nThe concept of self-sacrifice as a means to killing others dates back to antiquity with Samson's suicidal mass killing of the Philistine leaders, but the idea of suicide bombing \"as a tool of stateless terrorists\" was only \"dreamed up a hundred years ago by the European anarchists\", according to author Noah Feldman. It was not until 1983 when Shiite militants blew up the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, that it became a \"tool of modern terrorist warfare\".\nModern suicide bombing has been defined as \"involving explosives deliberately carried to the target either on the person or in a civilian vehicle and delivered by surprise\".  (Noah Feldman and many others exclude terror attacks such as the Lod Airport massacre where \"the perpetrator's ensured death\" was not \"a precondition for the success of his mission\".) The intended targets are often civilian, not just military or political.\n\n\nSuicide bombing was used by factions of the Lebanese Civil War and especially by the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) of Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Islamic Dawa Party's car bombing of the Iraqi embassy in Beirut in December 1981 and Hezbollah's bombing of the U.S. embassy in April 1983 and attack on United States Marine and French barracks in October 1983 brought suicide bombings international attention. Other parties to the civil war were quick to adopt the tactic, and by 1999 factions such as Hezbollah, the Amal Movement, the Ba'ath Party, and the Syrian Social Nationalist Party had carried out around 50 suicide bombings between them. (The latter of these groups sent the first recorded female suicide bomber in 1985.)\n\nDuring the Sri Lankan Civil War, the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) adopted suicide bombing as a tactic, using bomb belts and female bombers. The LTTE carried out their first suicide attack in July 1987, and their Black Tiger unit committed 83 suicide attacks from 1987 to 2009, killing 981 people, including former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, and the president of Sri Lanka, Ranasinghe Premadasa.\n\nAnother non-religious group involved in suicide attacks was the Kurdistan Workers' Party which began their insurgency against the Turkish state in 1984. According to the Chicago Project on Security and Terrorism's Suicide Attack Database, as of 2015, ten suicide attacks by the PKK from 1996 to 2012 killed 32 people and injured 116. (Suicide attacks are only part of the PKK's militant arsenal as they have killed or wounded hundreds of government workers and destroyed or damaged hundreds of school, post offices and mosques.)\n\nAl-Qaeda carried out its first suicide attack in the mid-1990s,\nand they first appeared in Israel and the Palestinian Territories in 1989.\n\n====9\/11 and after====\nIn early 2000, one analyst (Yoram Schweitzer) saw a pause in bombing campaigns and argued that \"most of the groups that were involved in suicide terrorism either stopped using it or eventually reduced it significantly.\"\n\nThe number of attacks using suicide tactics grew from an average of fewer than five per year during the 1980s to 81 suicide attacks in 2001 to 460 in 2005. By 2005, the tactic had spread to dozens of countries.\n\nSuicide bombing became a popular tactic among Palestinian militant organizations such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, and occasionally by the PFLP. The first suicide bombing in Israel was by Hamas in 1994. Attacks peaked from 2001\u20132003 with over 40 bombings and over 200 killed in 2002.\nBombers affiliated with these groups often use so-called \"suicide belts\", explosive devices (often including shrapnel) designed to be strapped to the body under clothing. In order to maximize the loss of life, the bombers seek out enclosed spaces, such as caf\u00e9s or city buses crowded with people at rush hour. Less common are military targets (for example, soldiers waiting for transport at roadside).\n\nThese bombings have tended to have more popular support than in other Muslim countries, and more music videos and announcements that promise eternal reward for suicide bombers can be found on Palestinian television (according to Palestinian Media Watch). Israeli sources observed that Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Fatah operate \"Paradise Camps\", training children as young as 11 to become suicide bombers.\n\nThe September 11, 2001 attacks, orchestrated by al-Qaeda, has been called \"the worst attack on American soil since the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor which thrust the United States into World War II\". They involved the hijacking of four large passenger jet airliners because their long transcontinental flight plans meant they carried more fuel, allowing a bigger explosion on impact (unlike earlier airline hijackings, the primary focus was the planes, not the passengers). Two planes were deliberately flown into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, destroying both 110 story skyscrapers within less than two hours, and a third was flown into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, causing severe damage to the west side of the building. These attacks resulted in the deaths of 221 people (including the 15 hijackers) on board the three planes as well as 2,731 more in and around the targeted buildings. A fourth plane crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after a revolt by the plane's passengers, killing all 44 people (including the four hijackers) on board. In total, the attacks killed 2,996 people and injured more than 6,000 others. The U.S. stock market closed for four trading days after the attacks (the first time it had an unscheduled closing since the Great Depression). Nine days after the attack, U.S. President George W. Bush called for a \"War on Terror\" and shortly thereafter launched the War in Afghanistan to find and capture Osama bin Laden, the head of the al-Qaeda organization that mounted the 9\/11 attacks.\n\n\nAfter the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, Iraqi and foreign insurgents carried out waves of suicide bombings. More attacks have been carried out in Iraq (1938 as of mid-2015) than in any other country.\n\nIn addition to United States military targets, they attacked many civilian targets such as Shiite mosques, international offices of the UN and the Red Cross. Iraqi men waiting to apply for jobs with the new army and police force were targets. In the lead up to the Iraqi parliamentary election, on January 30, 2005, suicide attacks upon civilian and police personnel involved with the elections increased. There were also reports of the insurgents co-opting disabled people as involuntary suicide bombers.\n\nOther major locations of suicide attack are Afghanistan (1059 attacks as of mid-2015)  and Pakistan (490 attacks).  In the first eight months of 2008, Pakistan overtook Iraq and Afghanistan in suicide bombings, with 28 bombings killing 471 people.\nSuicide bombings have become a tactic in Chechnya, first being used in the conflict in 2000 in Alkhan Kala,\nand spreading to Russia, notably with the Moscow theater hostage crisis in 2002 to the Beslan school hostage crisis in 2004.\n\nIn Europe four Islamist suicide bombers exploded home-made peroxide explosives on three London underground trains and a bus on 7 July 2005, during the morning rush hour. These \"7\/7\" bombings killed 52 civilians and injured 700.\n\nSince 2006, al-Shabaab and its predecessor, the Islamic Courts, have carried out major suicide attacks in Somalia, the worse year so far being 2014 with 16 attacks and over 120 killed.\n\n\n\n\n===Weapons and methods===\n\nMeans of suicide attack in the 20th and 21st centuries, include:\n* On foot: explosive belt, satchel charge: many, including the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi\n* With a plane as target and explosives hidden inside attackers shoe: Richard Reid on American Airlines Flight 63\n* With explosives hidden inside the body: 2009 attack on a Saudi prince, Muhammad bin Nayef\n* By car bomb: 1983 Beirut barracks bombing, Sri Lankan Central Bank bombing, numerous incidents in Iraq since 2003\n* By a boat with explosives: USS Cole bombing attacks in Aden, Yemen by Al-Qaeda; SLNS Sagarawardena sinking in Sri Lanka by Tamil Tigers.\n* By a submarine with explosives (human-steered torpedo): Kaiten, used by Japan in World War II\n* By a bicycle with explosives: Assassination of Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)\n* By a hijacked commercial jet airliner with fuel: September 11 attacks, attempted on Air France Flight 8969 and by Samuel Byck\n* By private plane: 2010 Austin plane crash and Mitsuyasu Maeno\n* By diverting a bus to an abyss: Tel Aviv Jerusalem bus 405 attack\n* By a car by using a fast driving car to drive intentionally into a crowd of people or breaching a security barrier: 2009 attack on the Dutch royal family\n\n===Strategy and advantages===\n\nAccording to author Jeffrey William Lewis, to succeed, campaigns of suicide bombing need:\n* willing individuals\n* organizations to train and use them\n* a society willing to accept such acts in the name of a greater good\n\nThe organizations work to guarantee individual suicide bombers that they \"will be remembered as martyrs dying for their communities\". By imbuing suicide bombing\/attacks with \"reverence and heroism\", it becomes more attractive to recruits.\nAccording to Yoram Schweitzer, modern suicide terrorism is \"aimed at causing devastating physical damage, through which it inflicts profound fear and anxiety\". Its goal is not to produce a negative psychological effect only on the victims of the actual attack, but on the entire target population.\nAttackers themselves have often framed suicide attacks as acts of courageous self-sacrifice in made necessary by the superior military or security strength of the enemy. The technique has also been called \"the atomic weapon of the weak\". According to Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the former leader of Hamas, \"Once we have warplanes and missiles, then we can think of changing our means of legitimate self-defense. But right now, we can only tackle the fire with our bare hands and sacrifice ourselves.\" While arguably this explains the motivation of many early suicide bombings in the 1980s and 90s, it cannot explain many later attacks, such as on funeral processions of the minority Shia in Pakistan.\n\nA major reason for the popularity of suicide attacks despite the sacrifice involved for its perpetrators is its tactical advantages over other types of terrorism, such as the ability to conceal weapons, make last-minute adjustments, increased ability to infiltrate heavily guarded targets, lack of need for remote or delayed detonation, escape plans or rescue teams.  Robert Pape observes: \"Suicide attacks are an especially convincing way to signal the likelihood of more pain to come, because if you are willing to kill yourself you are also willing to endure brutal retaliation. \"... The element of suicide itself helps increase the credibility of future attacks because it suggests that attackers cannot be deterred.\"\n\nBruce Hoffman describes the characteristics of suicide bombing, as \"universal\": \"Suicide bombings are inexpensive and effective. They are less complicated and compromising than other kinds of terrorist operations. They guarantee media coverage. The suicide terrorist is the ultimate smart bomb. Perhaps most important, coldly efficient bombings tear at the fabric of trust that holds societies together.\"\n\n==Attacker profiles and motivations==\nStudies of who becomes a suicide attacker and what motivates them have often come to different conclusions.\nAccording to Riaz Hassan, \"apart from one demographic attribute\u2014that the majority of suicide bombers tend to be young males\u2014the evidence has failed to find a stable set of demographic, psychological, socioeconomic and religious variables that can be causally linked to suicide bombers\u2019 personality or socioeconomic origins.\"  Scott Atran agrees: \"In targeting potential recruits for suicide terrorism, it must be understood that terrorist attacks will not be prevented by trying to profile terrorists. They are not sufficiently different from everyone else. Insights into homegrown jihadi attacks will have to come from understanding group dynamics, not individual psychology. Small-group dynamics can trump individual personality to produce horrific behavior in otherwise ordinary people.\" Reasons vary greatly, and are different in the case of each individual. Fanaticism (nationalist or religious, or both), results from brain-washing, negative experiences regarding \u201cthe enemy\u201d, the lack of a perspective in life. Suicides want to hurt or kill their targets because they hold them responsible for all bad things that has happened to them or in the world or simply just because they want to escape misery and poverty.\n\nBased on biographies of more than seven hundred foreign fighters uncovered at an Iraqi insurgent camp, researchers believe that the motivation for suicide missions (at least in Iraq) was not \"the global jihadi ideology\", but \"an explosive mix of desperation, pride, anger, sense of powerlessness, local tradition of resistance and religious fervor\".\n\nCriminal Justice professor Adam Lankford argues that suicide terrorists are not psychologically normal or stable, and are motivated to suicide\/killing to mask their desire to die beneath a \"veneer of heroic action\", because of the religious consequences of killing themselves outright. He has identified more than 130 individual suicide terrorists, including 9\/11 ringleader Mohamed Atta, with classic suicidal risk factors, such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, other mental health problems, drug addictions, serious physical injuries or disabilities, or having suffered the unexpected death of a loved one or from other personal crises.\n\nA study of the remains of 110 suicide bombers in Afghanistan for the first part of 2007 by Afghan pathologist Dr. Yusef Yadgari, found 80% were suffering from physical ailments such as missing limbs (before the blasts), cancer, or leprosy. Also in contrast to earlier findings of suicide bombers, the Afghan bombers were \"not celebrated like their counterparts in other Arab nations. Afghan bombers are not featured on posters or in videos as martyrs.\"\n\nAnthropologist Scott Atran's research has found that the attacks are not organized from the top down, but occurs from the bottom up. That is, it is usually a matter of following one's friends, and ending up in environments that foster groupthink. Atran is also critical of the claim that terrorists simply crave destruction; they are often motivated by beliefs they hold sacred, as well as their own moral reasoning.\n\nRobert Pape, director of the Chicago Project on Suicide Terrorism, found the majority of suicide bombers came from the educated middle classes. (Humam Balawi, who perpetrated the Camp Chapman attack in Afghanistan in 2010, was a medical doctor.)\nA 2004 paper by Harvard University Professor of Public Policy Alberto Abadie \"cast[s] doubt on the widely held belief that terrorism stems from poverty, finding instead that terrorist violence (not just suicide terrorism) is \"related to a nation's level of political freedom\", with countries \"in some intermediate range of political freedom\" more prone to terrorism than countries\nwith \"high levels\" of political freedom or countries with \"highly authoritarian regimes\". \"When governments are weak, political instability is elevated, so conditions are favorable for the appearance of terrorism\". A 2020 study found that while well-educated and economically well-off individuals are more likely to be behind suicide terrorism, it is not because these individuals self-select into suicide terrorism, but rather because terrorist groups are more likely to select high-quality individuals to commit suicide terrorist attacks.\n\nA study by German scholar Arata Takeda analyzes analogous behavior represented in literary texts from the antiquity through the 20th century (Sophocles' s Ajax, Milton's Samson Agonistes, Friedrich Schiller's The Robbers, Albert Camus's The Just Assassins) and comes to the conclusion \"that suicide bombings are not the expressions of specific cultural peculiarities or exclusively religious fanaticisms. Instead, they represent a strategic option of the desperately weak who strategically disguise themselves under the mask of apparent strength, terror, and invincibility.\"\n\n====Nationalist resistance and religion====\n\nTo what extent attackers are motivated by religious enthusiasm, by resistance to perceived outsider oppression or some combination of the two is disputed.\n\nAccording to Robert Pape, director of the Chicago Project on Suicide Terrorism, as of 2005, 95 percent of suicide attacks have the same specific strategic goal: to cause an occupying state to withdraw forces from a disputed territory, making nationalism not religion their principal motivation.\n\nBeneath the religious rhetoric with which [such terror] is perpetrated, it occurs largely in the service of secular aims. Suicide terrorism is mainly a response to foreign occupation rather than a product of Islamic fundamentalism ... Though it speaks of Americans as infidels, al-Qaida is less concerned with converting us to Islam than removing us from Arab and Muslim lands.\n\nAlternately, another source found that at least in one country (Lebanon from 1983\u20131999) it was Islamists who influenced secular nationalists\u2014their use of suicide attack spreading to the secular groups. Five Lebanese groups \"espousing a non-religious nationalist ideology\" followed the lead of Islamist groups in attacking by suicide, \"impressed by the effectiveness of Hezbollah's attacks in precipitating the withdrawal of the 'foreigners' from Lebanon\". (In Israel suicide attacks by Islamist Islamic Jihad and Hamas also preceded those of the secular PFLP and the Al-Fatah-linked Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades.)\n\nPape found other factors associated with suicide attacks included\n* the government of the targeted country being democratic and the public opinion of the country playing a role in determining policy.\n* a difference in religion between the attackers and occupiers;\n* grassroots support for the attacks;\n* attackers disproportionately from the educated middle classes;\n* high levels of brutality and cruelty by the occupiers, and\n* competition among militant groups fighting the occupiers.\n\nOther researchers contend that Pape's analysis is flawed, particularly his contention that democracies are the main targets of such attacks.\nAtran argues that suicide bombing has moved on from the days of Pape's study, that non-Islamic groups have carried out very few bombings since 2003, while bombing by Muslim or Islamist groups associated with a \"global ideology\" of \"martyrdom\" has skyrocketed. In one year, in one Muslim country alone\u00a0\u2013 2004 in Iraq\u00a0\u2013 there were 400 suicide attacks and 2,000 casualties.  Other researchers (such as Yotam Feldner) argue that perceived religious rewards in the hereafter are instrumental in encouraging Muslims to commit suicide attacks, or ask why prominent secular anti-occupation terrorist groups\u2014such as the Provisional IRA, ETA or anti-colonialist insurgents in Vietnam, Algeria, etc.\u2014have not used suicide, why he does not mention that the very first suicide attack in Lebanon (in 1981) targeted the embassy of Iraq, a country which was not occupying Lebanon.\n\nMia Bloom agrees with Pape that competition among insurgents groups is a significant motivator,  arguing the growth in suicide as a tactic is a product of \"outbidding\", i.e. the need by competing insurgent groups to demonstrate their commitment to the cause to broader public\u2014making the ultimate sacrifice for the insurgency being a \"bid\" impossible to top. (This explains its use by Palestinian groups, but not that by the Tamil Tigers.)\nStill other researchers have identified sociopolitical factors as more central in the motivation of suicide attackers than religion.\n\nAccording to Atran and former CIA case officer Marc Sageman, support for suicide actions is triggered by moral outrage at perceived attacks against Islam and sacred values, but this is converted to action as a result of small-world factors (such as being part of a football club with other jihadis). Millions express sympathy with global jihad (according to a 2006 Gallup study involving more than 50,000 interviews in dozens of countries, seven percent or at least 90 million of the world's 1.3 billion Muslims consider the 9\/11 attacks \"completely justified\").\n\nAlso arguing that the increase in suicide terrorism since 2001 is really driven by Salafi\/Jihadist ideology and Al-Qaeda is Assaf Moghadam.\n\nUpdating his work in a 2010 book Cutting the Fuse, Pape reported that a fine-grained analysis of the time and location of attacks strongly support his conclusion that \"foreign military occupation accounts for 98.5%\u2014and the deployment of American combat forces for 92%\u2014of all the 1,833 suicide terrorist attacks around the world\" between 2004 and 2009  Moreover, \"the success attributed to the surge in 2007 and 2008 was actually less the result of an increase in coalition forces and more to a change of strategy in Baghdad and the empowerment of the Sunnis in Anbar.\" (emphasis in the original)\n\nThe same logic can be seen in Afghanistan. In 2004 and early 2005, NATO occupied the north and west, controlled by the Northern Alliance, whom NATO had previously helped fight the Taliban. An enormous spike in suicide terrorism only occurred later in 2005 as NATO moved into the south and east, which had previously been controlled by the Taliban and locals were more likely to see NATO as a foreign occupation threatening local culture and customs. Critics argue the logic cannot be seen in Pakistan, which has no occupation and the second highest number of suicide bombing fatalities as of mid-2015.\n\n====Islam====\n\n\nWhat connection the high percentage of suicide attacks executed by Islamist groups since 1980 has to do with the religion of Islam is disputed. Specifically, scholars, researchers, and others, disagree over whether Islam forbids suicide in the process of attacking enemies or the killing of civilians. According to a report compiled by the Chicago Project on Suicide Terrorism, 224 of 300 suicide terror attacks from 1980 to 2003 involved Islamist groups or took place in Muslim-majority lands. Another tabulation found more than a fourfold increase in suicide bombings in the two years following Papes study and that the overwhelming majority of these bombers were motivated by the ideology of Islamist martyrdom. (For example, as of early 2008, 1121 Muslim suicide bombers have blown themselves up in Iraq.)\n\n=====Recent history=====\nIslamic suicide bombing is a fairly recent event.  It was totally absent from the 1979\u20131989 Afghan jihad against the Soviet Union, (an asymmetrical war where the mujahideen fought Soviet warplanes, helicopters and tanks primarily with light weapons).  According to author Sadakat Kadri, \"the very idea that Muslims might blow themselves up for God was unheard of before 1983, and it was not until the early 1990s that anyone anywhere had tried to justify killing innocent Muslims who were not on a battlefield.\" After 1983 the process was limited among Muslims to Hezbollah and other Lebanese Shi'a factions for more than a decade.\n\nSince then, the \"vocabulary of martyrdom and sacrifice\", videotaped pre-confession of faith by attackers have become part of \"Islamic cultural consciousness\", \"instantly recognizable\" to Muslims (according to Noah Feldman), while the tactic has spread through the Muslim world \"with astonishing speed and on a surprising course\".\n\nFirst the targets were American soldiers, then mostly Israelis, including women and children. From Lebanon and Israel, the technique of suicide bombing moved to Iraq, where the targets have included mosques and shrines, and the intended victims have mostly been Shiite Iraqis. ... [In] Afghanistan, ... both the perpetrators and the targets are orthodox Sunni Muslims. Not long ago, a bombing in Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand Province, killed Muslims, including women, who were applying to go on pilgrimage to Mecca. Overall, the trend is definitively in the direction of Muslim-on-Muslim violence. By a conservative accounting, more than three times as many Iraqis have been killed by suicide bombings in just three year (2003\u20136) as have Israelis in ten (from 1996\u20132006). Suicide bombing has become the archetype of Muslim violence\u00a0\u2013 not just to Westerners but also to Muslims themselves.\n\n\nRecent research on the rationale of suicide bombing has identified both religious and sociopolitical motivations. Those who cite religious factors as an important influence note that religion provides the framework because the bombers believe they are acting in the name of Islam and will be rewarded as martyrs. Since martyrdom is seen as a step towards paradise, those who commit suicide while discarding their community from a common enemy believe that they will reach an ultimate salvation after they die.\n\nIn the media attention given to suicide bombing during the Second Intifada and after 9\/11, sources hostile to radical Islamism quoted radical scholars promising various heavenly rewards, such as 70 virgins (houri) as wives, to Muslims who die as martyrs, (specifically as suicide attackers). \nOther rewards include \"From the moment the first drop of his blood is spilled, he does not feel the pain of his wounds and he is forgiven for all his sins\" according to Sheikh Abd Al-Salam Abu Shukheydem, Chief Mufti of the Palestinian Authority police force, (Shukheydem does not specify that the martyrs have been killed as suicide attackers) (Source:) One Israeli source (Y. Feldner of MEMRI) complained that the death announcements of martyrs in the Palestinian press often take the form of wedding, not funeral, announcements. `Blessings will be accepted immediately after the burial and until 10 p.m. ...at the home of the martyr's uncle,` read one suicide bomber's death notice. `With great pride, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad marries the member of its military wing... the martyr and hero Yasser Al-Adhami, to \"the black-eyed,\"` read another.\n\nOther alleged rewards for those dying in jihad are feeling no pain from the cause of their death, being cleansed of all sin and brought directly to paradise, not having to wait for the Day of Judgement.\n\nOthers (such as As'ad AbuKhalil) maintain that \"the tendency to dwell on the sexual motives\" of the suicide bombers \"belittles\" the bombers \"sociopolitical causes\", and that the alleged \"sexual frustration\" of young Muslim men \"has been overly emphasized in the Western and Israeli media\" as a motive for terrorism.\n;Support for \"martyrdom operations\"\nIslamist militant organisations (including al-Qaeda, Hamas and Islamic Jihad) argue that despite what some Muslims claim is Islam's strict prohibition of suicide and murder,\nsuicide attacks fulfill the obligation of jihad against the \"oppressor\", \"martyrs\" will be rewarded with paradise, and have the support of (some) Muslim clerics.\nClerics have supported suicide attacks largely in connection with the Palestinian issue. Prominent Sunni cleric Yusuf al-Qaradawi previously had supported such attacks by Palestinians in perceived defense of their homeland as heroic and an act of resistance. Shiite Lebanese cleric Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah, the spiritual authority recognized by Hezbollah, holds similar views.\nAccording to the conservative Iranian Shi'ah cleric Ayatollah Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi, \"When protecting Islam and the Muslim community depends on martyrdom operations, it not only is allowed, but even is an obligation as many of the Shi'ah great scholars and Maraje', including Ayatullah Safi Golpayegani and Ayatullah Fazel Lankarani, have clearly announced in their fatwas.\"\n\nThe Quranic verse used by Zarein Ahmedzay (an Afghanistan-born New York City cab driver who traveled to Waziristan for terrorist training and discussed possible suicide bombing target locations in crowded parts of Manhattan) in support of his actions was 9:111 (Surah At-Tawba):Lo! Allah hath bought from the believers their lives and their wealth because the Garden will be theirs: they shall fight in the way of Allah and shall slay and be slain. It is a promise which is binding on Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Quran. Who fulfilleth His covenant better than Allah? Rejoice then in your bargain that ye have made, for that is the supreme triumph.\n\nSupporters of the Taliban insist their attacks are \"martyrdom operations\" and not suicide. The June 2013 issue of the Taliban magazine Azan extolled the virtues of suicide attacks, claiming that \"suicide bombing\" is a \"false term\" for jihad martyrdom attacks. \"So martyrdom operation \u2260  Suicide bombing\".\n\nThe articles maintains that Abu Huraira (a companion of the Muhammad) and Umar ibn Khattab (the third caliph of Islam), approved acts in which the Muslims knew would lead to certain death, and that the Islamic prophet Muhammad also approved of such acts (according to authors Maulana Muawiya Hussaini and Ikrimah Anwar cited numerous Hadith of Muhammad on the authority of Islamic jurist Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj). \"The Sahaba [companions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad] who carried out the attacks almost certainly knew that they were going to be killed during their operations but they still carried them out and such acts were extolled and praised in the sharia.\"\n\n;Opposition and responses from Muslim scholars\nOthers (such as Middle East historian Bernard Lewis) disagree, noting ... a clear difference was made between throwing oneself to certain death at the hands of an overwhelmingly strong enemy, and dying by one's own hand. The first, if conducted in a properly authorized [ jihad ], was a passport to heaven; the second to damnation. The blurring of their previously vital distinction was the work of some twentieth-century theologians who outlined the new theory which the suicide bombers put into practice.\" The difference between engaging in an act where the perpetrator plans to fight to the death but where the attack does not require their death, is important to at least one Islamist terror group\u2014Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). While the group extols \"martyrdom\" and has killed many civilians, LeT believes suicide attacks where the attackers dies by their own hand (such as by pressing a detonation button), are haram (forbidden). Its \"trademark\" is that of perpetrators fighting \"to the death\" but escaping \"if practical\". \"This distinction has been the subject of extensive discourse among radical Islamist leaders.\"\n\nA number of Western and Muslim scholars of Islam have posited that suicide attacks are a clear violation of classical Islamic law and characterized such attacks against civilians as murderous and sinful.\n\nAccording to Bernard Lewis,  \"the emergence of the now widespread terrorism practice of suicide bombing is a development of the 20th century. It has no antecedents in Islamic history, and no justification in terms of Islamic theology, law, or tradition.\" Islamic legal rules of armed warfare or military jihad are covered in detail in the classical texts of Islamic jurisprudence, which forbidding the killing of women, children or non-combatants, and the destroying of cultivated or residential areas.\nFor more than a millennium, these tenets were accepted by Sunnis and Shiites; however, since the 1980s militant Islamists have challenged the traditional Islamic rules of warfare to justify suicide attacks.\n\nA number of respected Muslim scholars have provided scholastic refutations of suicide bombings, condemning them as terrorism prohibited in Islam and leading their perpetrators to hell. In his 400+-page Fatwa on Terrorism condemning suicide attacks, Muslim Islamic scholar Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri directly disputed the rationale of Islamists, arguing among other things that the indiscriminately killing of both Muslims and non-Muslims is unlawful, and brings the Muslim ummah into disrepute, no matter how lofty the killers intentions. Tahir-ul-Qadri states terrorism \"has no place in Islamic teaching, and no justification can be provided to it...good intention cannot justify a wrong and forbidden act\".\n\nThe Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah Al Shaykh, issued a fatwa on September 12, 2013, that suicide bombings are \"great crimes\" and bombers are \"criminals who rush themselves to hell by their actions\". Al Shaykh described suicide bombers as \"robbed of their minds... who have been used (as tools) to destroy themselves and societies\".\n\n\"In view of the fast-moving dangerous developments in the Islamic world, it is very distressing to see the tendencies of permitting or underestimating the shedding of blood of Muslims and those under protection in their countries. The sectarian or ignorant utterances made by some of these people would benefit none other than the greedy, vindictive and envious people. Hence, we would like to draw attention to the seriousness of the attacks on Muslims or those who live under their protection or under a pact with them\", Al Shaykh said, quoting a number of verses from the Qur'an and Hadith.\n\nIn 2005, following a series of bombings by the banned outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) Ubaidul Haq, the chief cleric of Bangladesh led a protest of ulema denouncing terrorism. He said:\n\"Islam prohibits suicide bombings. These bombers are enemies of Islam.\" \"It is a duty for all Muslims to stand up against those who are killing people in the name of Islam.\"\n\nIn January 2006, Ayatollah al-Udhma Yousof al-Sanei, a Shia Marja (high ranking cleric), decreed a fatwa against suicide bombing, declaring it a \"terrorist act\".  In 2005 Muhammad Afifi al-Akiti also issued a fatwa \"Against The Targeting Of Civilians\".\n\nIhsanic Intelligence, a London-based Islamic think-tank, published their two-year study into suicide bombings in the name of Islam, The Hijacked Caravan, which concluded that,The technique of suicide bombing is anathema, antithetical and abhorrent to Sunni Islam. It is considered legally forbidden, constituting a reprehensible innovation in the Islamic tradition, morally an enormity of sin combining suicide and murder and theologically an act which has consequences of eternal damnation.\n\nAmerican based Islamic jurist and scholar Khaled Abou Al-Fadl argues,\nThe classical jurists, nearly without exception, argued that those who attack by stealth, while targeting noncombatants in order to terrorize the resident and wayfarer, are corrupters of the earth. \"Resident and wayfarer\" was a legal expression that meant that whether the attackers terrorize people in their urban centers or terrorize travelers, the result was the same: all such attacks constitute a corruption of the earth. The legal term given to people who act this way was muharibun (those who wage war against society), and the crime is called the crime of hiraba (waging war against society). The crime of hiraba was so serious and repugnant that, according to Islamic law, those guilty of this crime were considered enemies of humankind and were not to be given quarter or sanctuary anywhere .... Those who are familiar with the classical tradition will find the parallels between what were described as crimes of hiraba and what is often called terrorism today nothing short of remarkable. The classical jurists considered crimes such as assassinations, setting fires, or poisoning water wells\u00a0\u2013 that could indiscriminately kill the innocent\u00a0\u2013 as offenses of hiraba. Furthermore, hijacking methods of transportation or crucifying people in order to spread fear are also crimes of hiraba. Importantly, Islamic law strictly prohibited the taking of hostages, the mutilation of corpses, and torture.\n\nAccording to Charles Kimball, chair of the Department of Religion at Wake Forest University, \"There is only one verse in the Qur'an that contains a phrase related to suicide\" (4:29):O you who have believed, do not consume one another's wealth unjustly but only [in lawful] business by mutual consent. And do not kill yourselves. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful.\nSome commentators posit that \"do not kill yourselves\" is better translated \"do not kill each other\", and some translations (e.g., by M.H. Shakir) reflect that view. Mainstream Islamic groups such as the European Council for Fatwa and Research also cite the Quranic verse Al-An'am 6:151)] as prohibiting suicide: \"And take not life, which Allah has made sacred, except by way of justice and law\". The Hadith, including Bukhari 2:445, states: \"The Prophet said, '...whoever commits suicide with a piece of iron will be punished with the same piece of iron in the Hell Fire', [and] 'A man was inflicted with wounds and he committed suicide, and so Allah said: 'My slave has caused death on himself hurriedly, so I forbid Paradise for him.'\"\n\nOther Muslims have also noted Quranic verses in opposition to suicide, to taking of life other than by way of justice (i.e. the death penalty for murder), and to collective punishment.\n\nThe international community considers the use of indiscriminate attacks on civilian populations and the use of human shields as illegal under international law.\n\n;Public surveys\n\n\nSupport by Muslims for \"suicide bombing and other forms of violence that target civilians in order to defend Islam\", has varied over time and by country. The Pew Global Attitudes Project survey of the Muslim public found support has declined over the years (on average) from a post-9\/11 high. The highest support for such acts has been reported in the occupied Palestinian territories where in 2014 46 percent of Muslims in Palestine thought such attacks were sometimes\/oftentimes justified.\n\n====Gender====\n\n\nSuicide operatives are overwhelmingly male in most groups, but among Chechen rebels and the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) women form the majority of the attackers.\n\nFemale suicide bombers have been observed in many predominantly nationalist conflicts by a variety of organizations against both military and civilian targets. In February 2002, however, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the religious leader of Hamas, issued a fatwa, giving women permission to participate in suicide attacks.\n\nDuring the 1980s the greatest number of female suicide attacks in any single year was five. By contrast, in 2008 alone there were 35 female suicide attacks and in 2014 there were 15 such attacks according to the Chicago Project on Security and Terrorism (CPOST) Suicide Attack Database.\n* In Lebanon on April 9, 1985, Sana'a Mehaidli, a member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP), detonated an explosive-laden vehicle, which killed two Israeli soldiers and injured twelve more. She is believed to have been the first female suicide bomber. She is known as \"the Bride of the South\". During the Lebanese Civil War, female SSNP members bombed Israeli troops and the Israeli proxy militia the South Lebanon Army.\n* Sri Lanka's political group, the Black Wing Tigers, executed 330 suicide bombing attacks and were all executed mainly by women. The group was formed in 1987 and was disbanded in 2009.\n* On May 21, 1991, former Indian Prime minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by Thenmozhi Rajaratnam, a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Approximately 30% of the organization's suicide bombings were carried out by women.\n* The Chechen shahidkas have attacked Russian troops in Chechnya and Russian civilians elsewhere; for example, in the Moscow theater hostage crisis. \n* Women of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) have carried out suicide bombings primarily against Turkish Armed Forces, in some cases strapping explosives to their abdomen in order to simulate pregnancy.\n* Wafa Idris, under Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, became the first Palestinian female suicide bomber on January 28, 2002, when she blew herself up on Jaffa Road in Central Jerusalem.\n* On February 27, 2002, Darine Abu Aisha carried out a suicide bombing at the Maccabim checkpoint of the Israeli army near Jerusalem. On the same day, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the religious leader of the Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas, issued a fatwa, or religious rule, that gave women permission to participate in suicide attacks, and stated that they would be rewarded in the afterlife.\n* Ayat al-Akhras, the third and youngest Palestinian female suicide bomber (at age 18), killed herself and two Israeli civilians on March 29, 2002, by detonating explosives belted to her body in a supermarket. She had been trained by the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, a group linked to the armed branch of Fatah (Yasser Arafat's party), more secular than Hamas. The killings gained widespread international attention due to Ayat's age and gender and the fact that one of the victims was also a teenage girl.\n* Hamas deployed its first female suicide bomber, Reem Riyashi, on January 14, 2004. Al-Riyashi attacked Erez checkpoint, killing 7 people.\n* Two female attackers attacked U.S. troops in Iraq on August 5, 2003. Whereas female suicide bombers are not typically introduced in initial stages of a conflict, this attack demonstrates the early and significant involvement of Iraqi women in the Iraq War.\n* On 29 March 2010, two female Chechen terrorists bombed two Moscow subway stations killing at least 38 people and injuring more than 60 people.\n* The Taliban has used at least one female suicide bomber in Afghanistan.\n* On December 25, 2010, the first female suicide bomber in Pakistan detonated her explosives-laden vest, killing at least 43 people at an aid distribution center in northwestern Pakistan.\n* On December 29, 2013, a female Chechen suicide bomber detonated her vest in the Volgograd railway station killing at least 17 people.\n* On December 23, 2016, the first female suicide bomber in Bangladesh detonated her explosive during a police raid.\n\nAccording to a report issued by intelligence analysts in the U.S. army in 2011, \"Although women make up roughly 15% of the suicide bombers within groups which utilize females, they were responsible for 65% of assassinations; 20% of women who committed a suicide attack did so with the purpose of assassinating a specific individual, compared with 4% of male attackers.\" The report further stated that female suicide bombers often were \"grieving the loss of family members [and] seeking revenge against those they feel are responsible for the loss, unable to produce children, [and\/or] dishonored through sexual indiscretion.\"\nMale suicide bombers are presented as being motivated more by political factors than female suicide bombers are.\n\nAnother study of suicide bombers from 1981 and July 2008 by Lindsey A. O\u2019Rourke found female bombers are generally in their late twenties, significantly older than their male counterparts.\n\nO\u2019Rourke found the average number of victims killed by a female suicide attacker was higher than that for male attackers for every group studied (Tamil, PKK, Lebanese, Chechen, Palestinian). Consequently, terrorist organizations recruit and motivate women to participate in suicide attacks, using traditional attitudes of honor and feminine harmlessness and vulnerability among target populations to insert attackers were they can cause a maximum of death and destruction.  Bombs have been disguised as a pregnant belly, avoiding invasive searches, seen as taboo. By stumbling or calling out in distress more victims may be drawn to the explosion. These women have proven to be more deadly with higher success rates with more casualties and deaths than their male counterparts. The woman bomber carriers are not permitted to hold and control the detonator, which are still held by the men in charge.  Until recently, attacks of women bombers were considered more newsworthy because of the \"unladylike\" behavior of their perpetrator.\n\n====Specific groups====\nStudies have attempted to learn the history and motivation of suicide attackers.\n;Al Qaeda\nAnalysis of the 9\/11 Al Qaeda attackers found almost all had joined the group with someone else. About 70% joined with friends, 20% with kin. Interviews with friends of the 9\/11 pilots reveal they were not \"recruited\" into Qaeda. They were Middle Eastern Arabs isolated even among the Moroccan and Turkish Muslims who predominate in Germany. Seeking friendship, they began hanging out after services at the Masjad al-Quds and other nearby mosques in Hamburg, in local restaurants and in the dormitory of the Technical University in the suburb of Harburg. Three (Mohamed Atta, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Marwan al-Shehhi) wound up living together as they self-radicalized. They wanted to go to Chechnya, then Kosovo.\n\n;Hamas\n\nHamas's most sustained suicide bombing campaign in 2003\u201304 involved several members of Hebron's Masjad (mosque) al-Jihad soccer team. Most lived in the Wad Abu Katila neighborhood and belonged to the al-Qawasmeh hamula (clan); several were classmates in the neighborhood's local branch of the Palestinian Polytechnic College. Their ages ranged from 18 to 22. At least eight team members were dispatched to suicide shooting and bombing operations by the Hamas military leader in Hebron, Abdullah al-Qawasmeh (killed by Israeli forces in June 2003 and succeeded by his relatives Basel al-Qawasmeh, killed in September 2003, and Imad al-Qawasmeh, captured on October 13, 2004). In retaliation for the assassinations of Hamas leaders Sheikh Ahmed Yassin (March 22, 2004) and Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi (April 17, 2004), Imad al-Qawasmeh dispatched Ahmed al-Qawasmeh and Nasim al-Ja'abri for a suicide attack on two buses in Beer Sheva (August 31, 2004). In December 2004, Hamas declared a halt to suicide attacks.\n\nOn January 15, 2008, the son of Mahmoud al-Zahar, the leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, was killed (another son was killed in a 2003 assassination attempt on Zahar). Three days later, Israel Defense Minister Ehud Barak ordered Israel Defense Forces to seal all border crossings with Gaza, cutting off the flow of supplies to the territory in an attempt to stop rocket barrages on Israeli border towns. Nevertheless, violence from both sides only increased. On February 4, 2008, two friends (Mohammed Herbawi, Shadi Zghayer), who were members of the Masjad al-Jihad soccer team, staged a suicide bombing at commercial center in Dimona, Israel. Herbawi had previously been arrested as a 17-year-old on 15 March 2003 shortly after a suicide bombing on Haifa bus (by Mamoud al-Qawasmeh on March 5, 2003) and coordinated suicide shooting attacks on Israeli settlements by others on the team (March 7, 2003, Muhsein, Hazem al-Qawasmeh, Fadi Fahuri, Sufian Hariz) and before another set of suicide bombings by team members in Hebron and Jerusalem on May 17\u201318, 2003 (Fuad al-Qawasmeh, Basem Takruri, Mujahed al-Ja'abri). Although Hamas claimed responsibility for the Dimona attack, the politburo leadership in Damascus and Beirut was clearly initially unaware of who initiated and carried out the attack. It appears that Ahmad al-Ja'abri, military commander of Hamas's Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades in Gaza requested the suicide attack through Ayoub Qawasmeh, Hamas's military liaison in Hebron, who knew where to look for eager young men who had self-radicalized together and had already mentally prepared themselves for martyrdom.\n\n;LTTE\nThe Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam were thought to have mastered the use of suicide terrorism and had a separate unit, \"The Black Tigers\", consisting \"exclusively of cadres who have volunteered to conduct suicide operations\".\n\n;Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant\nThe Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant utilizes suicide attacks against government targets before they attack. The attackers can use a wide range of methods, from suicide vests and belts to bomb trucks and cars and APCs filled to the brim with explosives. Usually, the suicide bomber involved in a \"martyrdom operation\" will record his last words in a martyrdom video before they start their attack and will be released after the suicide attack was done.\n\nA study published by The Guardian in 2017 analyzed 923 attacks done between December 2015 and November 2016 and compared the military tactic to those used by kamikaze operations. Charlie Winter, author of the study, indicated that ISIL had \"industrialized the concept of matyrdom\". Most (84%) of suicide attacks were directed towards military targets usually with armed vehicles. About 80% of the attackers were of Iraqi or Syrian origin.\n\n==Response and results==\n;Response\nSuicide bombings are often followed by heightened security measures and reprisals by their targets. Because a successful suicide bomber cannot be targeted, the response is often a targeting of those believed to have sent the bomber.  Because future attacks cannot be deterred by the threat of retaliation if the attackers were already willing to kill themselves, pressure is great to employ intensive surveillance of virtually any potential perpetrator, \"to look for them almost everywhere, even if no evidence existed that `they` were `there` at all\".\n\nIn the West Bank the IDF has at times demolished homes that belong to families whose children (or landlords whose tenants) had volunteered for such missions (whether successfully or not).\nOther military measures that were taken during the suicide attack campaign included: A widescale re-occupation of the West Bank and blockading of Palestinian towns; \"targeted assassinations\" of militants, (an approach used since the 1970s); raids against militants suspected of plotting attacks, mass arrests, curfews, and stringent travel restrictions; and physical separation from Palestinians via the 650-km (400-mile) Israeli West Bank barrier in and around the West Bank. The Second Intifada and its suicide attacks are often dated as ending around the time of an unofficial ceasefire by some of the most powerful Palestinian militant groups in 2005.  A new \"knife intifada\" started in September 2015, but although many Palestinians were killed in the process of stabbing or attempting to stab Israelis, their deaths were not \"a precondition for the success\" of their mission and so are not considered suicide attacks by many observers.)\n\nIn the United States, the element of suicide in the major attack on it (the 9\/11 attacks) persuaded many that previously unthinkable, \"out of the box\" strategic policies in a \"war on terrorism\"\u00a0\u2014 from \"preventive war\" against countries not immediately attacking the US, to almost unlimited surveillance of virtually any person in the United States by the government without normal congressional and judicial oversight\u2014was necessary. These responses \"produced their own costs and risks\u2014in lives, national debt, and America's standing in the world\".\n\nThe \"heightened security measures\" also affected the target populations.  During the bombing campaign Israelis were questioned by armed guards and given a quick pat down before being let into cafes. In the US, the post-9\/11 era meant \"previously inconceivable security measures\u2014in airports and other transportation hubs, hotels and office buildings, sports stadiums and concert halls\".\n\n;Results\n\nOne of the first bombing campaigns utilizing primarily suicide attacks had considerable success. In the early 1980s Hezbollah used these bombing attacks targeting first foreign peacekeepers and then Israel. The result in both cases was withdrawal from Lebanon by the targets.\n\nOther groups have had mixed results. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) pioneered the use of suicide bombings against civilian and political targets and in 2000 were called (by Yoram Schweitzer) \"unequivocally the most effective and brutal terrorist organization ever to utilize suicide terrorism\". Their struggle for an independent state in the North and East of the island lasted for 26 years and led to the deaths of two heads of state or government, several ministers, and up to 100,000 combatants and civilians (by a UN estimate). Politically its attacks succeeded in halting the deployment of the Indian peace keeping troops to Sri-Lanka and the subsequent postponement of the peace-talks in Sri-Lanka. Nonetheless it ended in May 2009 not with an independent \"Eelam\", but with the overrunning of LTTE strongholds and the killing of its leadership by the Sri Lankan military and security forces.\n\nIt is more difficult to determine whether Palestinian suicide bombings have proved to be a successful tactic. Hamas \"came to prominence\" after the first intifada as \"the main Palestinian opponent of the Oslo Accords\" (\"the US-sponsored peace process that oversaw the gradual and partial removal of Israel's occupation in return for Palestinian guarantees to protect Israeli security\") according to the BBC.\nThe accords were sidetracked after the election in 1996 of right wing Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu.  Hamas's suicide bombings of Israeli targets (from 1994\u20131997 there were 14 suicide attacks killing 159\u2014not all of which were attributed to Hamas) \"were widely\" credited for the popularity among Israelis of the hardline Netanyahu, who\u2014like HAMAS\u2014was a staunch opponent of the Oslo accords, but an even stauncher enemy of HAMAS.\n\nThe efficacy of suicide bombing however, does not appear to have demonstrated by the al-Aqsa Intifada. During this Intifada, the number of suicide attacks increased markedly, but petered out around 2005 following harsh Israeli security measures (mentioned above) such as \"targeted assassinations\" of Palestinians reportedly involved in terrorism, and the building of a \"separation barrier\" that severely hampered Palestinian travel, but with no withdrawal by the Israelis from any occupied territory.\n\nThe drop in suicide bombings in Israel has been explained by the many security measures taken by the Israeli government, especially the building of the \"separation barrier\", and a general consensus among Palestinians that the bombings were a \"losing strategy\".  The suicide (and non-suicide) attacks on civilians had \"a major impact\" on the attitudes of the Israeli public\/voters, creating not demoralization, but even greater support for the right-wing Likud party, bringing to office another hardliner, former general, prime minister Ariel Sharon. In 2001, 89% of Israeli Jews supported the Sharon government's policy of \"targeted assassinations\" of Palestinian militants involved in terrorism against Israel, the number rising to 92% in 2003. Opinion polls of the Jewish Israelis found 78\u201384% support for the \"separation barrier\" in 2004.\n\nIn the case of the 9\/11 attacks in the US, at least in the short term, the results were negative for Al-Qaeda, as well as the Taliban Movement. Since the attacks, Western nations have diverted massive resources towards stopping similar actions, as well as tightening up borders, and military actions against various countries believed to have been involved with terrorism. Critics of the War on Terrorism suggest the results were negative, as the proceeding actions of the United States and other countries has increased the number of recruits, and their willingness to carry out suicide bombings.\n\n==See also==\n* 7 July 2005 London bombings\n* 2010 Austin plane crash\n* Child suicide bombers in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict\n* Explosive belt\n* Fieseler Fi 103R Reichenberg\n* Heather Penney\n* List of Palestinian suicide attacks\n* Martyrdom video\n* Murder-suicide\n* Pierre Rehov\n* Proxy bomb\n\n===Notes===\n\n\n===Citations===\n\n\n==Bibliography==\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Further reading==\n\n;Books\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n*  ( Full text, digitalized by the Bavarian State Library)\n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n----\n;Articles\n----\n* \n* Butterworth, Bruce Robert; Dolev, Shalom; Jenkins, Brian Michael (2012). \" Security Awareness for Public Bus Transportation: Case Studies of Attacks Against the Israeli Public Bus System\", Mineta Transportation Institute; accessed March 22, 2015.\n* Conesa, Pierre (2004). \"Aux origines des attentats-suicides\".

{"title":"Istishhad","article":"Istishhad is the Arabic word for \"martyrdom\", \"death of a martyr\", or \"heroic death\". In recent years the term has been said to \"emphasize... heroism in the act of sacrifice\" rather than \"victimization\", and has \"developed...into a military and political strategy\", often called \"martyrdom operations\". One who martyrs themselves is given the honorific shahid.\n\n==History==\nMuslim Acehnese from the Aceh Sultanate performed suicide attacks known as Parang-sabil against Dutch invaders during the Aceh War. It was considered as part of personal jihad in the Islamic religion of the Acehnese. The Dutch called it Atj\u00e8h-moord, which literally translates to Aceh murder. The Acehnese work of literature, the Hikayat Perang Sabil provided the background and reasoning for the \"Aceh-mord\" \u2013 Acehnese suicide attacks upon the Dutch, The Indonesian translations of the Dutch terms are Aceh bodoh (Aceh pungo) or Aceh gila (Aceh mord).\n\nAtj\u00e8h-moord was also used against the Japanese by the Acehnese during the Japanese occupation of Aceh. The Acehnese Ulama (Islamic clerics) fought against both the Dutch and the Japanese, revolting against the Dutch in February 1942 and against Japan in November 1942. The revolt was led by the All-Aceh Religious Scholars' Association ( PUSA). The Japanese suffered 18 dead in the uprising while they slaughtered up to 100 or over 120 Acehnese. The revolt happened in Bayu and was centred around Tjot Plieng village's religious school. During the revolt, the Japanese troops armed with mortars and machine guns were charged by sword wielding Acehnese under Teungku Abduldjalil (Tengku Abdul Djalil) in Buloh Gampong Teungah and Tjot Plieng on 10 and 13 November. In May 1945 the Acehnese rebelled again.\n\nThe original Jawi script Acehnese language work Hikayat Perang Sabil (w:ace:Hikayat Prang Sabi, w:id:Hikayat Prang Sabi) has been transliterated into the Latin alphabet and annotated by Ibrahim Alfian (Teuku.) published in Jakarta. Perang sabi was the Acehnese word for jihad, a holy war and Acehnese language literary works on perang sabi were distributed by Islamic clerics ('ulama) such as Teungku di Tiro to help the resistance against the Dutch in the Aceh War. The recompense awarded by in paradise detailed in Islamic Arabic texts and Dutch atrocities were expounded on in the Hikayat Perang Sabil which was communally read by small cabals of Ulama and Acehnese who swore an oath before going to achieve the desired status of \"martyr\" by launching suicide attacks on the Dutch. Perang sabil was the Malay equivalent to other terms like Jihad, Ghazawat for \"Holy war\", the text was also spelled \"Hikayat perang sabi\". Fiction novels like Sayf Muhammad Isa's Sabil: Prahara di Bumi Rencong on the war by Aceh against the Dutch include references ro Hikayat Perang Sabil. \tMualimbunsu Syam Muhammad wrote the work called \"Motives for Perang Sabil in Nusantara\", Motivasi perang sabil di Nusantara: kajian kitab Ramalan Joyoboyo, Dalailul-Khairat, dan Hikayat Perang Sabil on Indonesia's history of Islamic holy war (Jihad). Children and women were inspired to do suicide attacks by the Hikayat Perang Sabil against the Dutch. Hikayat Perang Sabil is also known as \"Hikayat Prang Sabi. Hikayat Perang Sabil is considered as part of 19th century Malay literature. In Dutch occupied Aceh, Hikayat Perang Sabil was confiscated from Sabi's house during a Police raid on September 27, 1917.\n\nIn the Philippines the Moro Muslims are reported to have engaged in suicide attacks against enemies as early as the 16th century. Those who performed suicide attacks were called mag-sabil, and the suicide attacks were known as Parang-sabil. The Spanish called them juramentado. The idea of the juramentado was considered part of jihad in the Moros' Islamic religion. During an attack, a Juramentado would throw himself at his targets and kill them with bladed weapons such as barongs and kris until he himself was killed. The Moros performed juramentado suicide attacks against the Spanish in the Spanish\u2013Moro conflict of the 16th to the 19th centuries, against the Americans in the Moro Rebellion (1899\u20131913), and against the Japanese in World War II. The Moro Juramentados aimed their attacks specifically against their enemies, and not against non-Muslims in general. They launched suicide attacks on the Japanese, Spanish, Americans and Filipinos, but did not attack the non-Muslim Chinese as the Chinese were not considered enemies of the Moro people. The Japanese responded to these suicide attacks by massacring all the relatives of the attacker.\n\nThe origins of modern Istishhadi attacks lie among the Shia in Iran during the Iran\u2013Iraq War of 1980\u20131988.  Mohammed Hossein Fahmideh, a 13-year-old boy who fought in the war, is said to be the first Muslim to have participated in such an attack in contemporary history. He strapped rocket-propelled grenades to his chest and blew himself up under an Iraqi tank in November 1980. Ayatollah Khomeini declared Fahmideh a national hero and inspiration for further volunteers for martyrdom.  Other Iranian basij volunteers ran through minefields to detonate buried landmines and clear a safe battlefield path for following soldiers.\n\nShia usually refer to the martyrdom of Hussain ibn Ali and his companions and family members in the Battle of Karbala as role models and inspiration for martyrdom as a glorious and noble death.\n\nWhen the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas first carried out suicide attacks \u2013 involved strapping the body of the mission carrier with explosives \u2013 in the Israeli-inhabited towns of Afula and Khidara in the spring of 1994, it \"described these operations as `amaliyat istishhadiya (martyrdom operations)\" rather than the more secular a'maliyat fida'iyah (self-sacrifice operations).  The term 'amaliyat istishhadiya has caught on and \"today, istishhad is the most frequently used term to refer to acts of sacrifice in the Palestinian resistance and is used by Islamic, secular, and Marxist groups alike\".\n\nAccording to one scholar, Noah Feldman: \"The vocabulary of martyrdom and sacrifice, the formal videotaped preconfession of faith, the technological tinkering to increase deadliness\u2014all are now instantly recognizable to every Muslim.\" Feldman sees a worrying trend in the steady expansion of the targets of Istishhad since its debut in 1983 when successful bombing of barracks and embassy buildings drove the U.S. military out of Lebanon.\n\nFirst the targets were American soldiers, then mostly Israelis, including women and children. From Lebanon and Israel, the technique of suicide bombing moved to Iraq, where the targets have included mosques and shrines, and the intended victims have mostly been Shiite Iraqis. The newest testing ground is Afghanistan, where both the perpetrators and the targets are orthodox Sunni Muslims. Not long ago, a bombing in Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand Province, killed Muslims, including women, who were applying to go on pilgrimage to Mecca. Overall, the trend is definitively in the direction of Muslim-on-Muslim violence. By a conservative accounting, more than three times as many Iraqis have been killed by suicide bombings in the last 3 years as have Israelis in the last 10. Suicide bombing has become the archetype of Muslim violence\u2014not just to frightened Westerners but also to Muslims themselves.\n\n\n\n\n==Martyrdom operation==\n\nMilitant groups term attacks on military or civilian targets in which the attacker is expected to die, most frequently by detonation of a bomb, as \"martyrdom operations\". The term is usually used by Muslim militants, although non-Muslim groups, such as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, have also engaged in suicide attacks. Islamist militants prefer the term \"martyrdom operation\" to \"suicide attack\", as suicide is forbidden under classical Islamic law.  While combat inherently involves a risk of death, a \"martyrdom operation\" implies a deliberate act leading to death as part of the attack.\n\nActs of istishhad are governed by Islamic legal rules associated with armed warfare or military jihad.  The rules governing jihad, literally meaning struggle but often called \"holy war\" by non-Muslims, are covered in exquisite detail in the classical texts of Islamic jurisprudence. In orthodox Islamic law, jihad is a collective religious obligation on the Muslim community, when the community is endangered or Muslims are subjected to oppression and subjugation. The rules governing such conflicts include not killing women, children or non-combatants, and leaving cultivated or residential areas undamaged.\n\nFor more than a millennium, these tenets were accepted by Sunnis and Shiites; however, since the 1980s militant Islamists have challenged the traditional Islamic rules of warfare in an attempt to justify suicide attacks despite clear contradictions to established Islamic laws.\n\n==Scholarship==\nSome Western and Muslim scholars of Islam find suicide attacks to be a clear violation of classical Islamic law. Nevertheless, the militant groups that carry out \"martyrdom operations\" believe that their actions fulfill the obligation of jihad, and  some clerics support this view.\n\n===Against suicide attacks===\n\nSuicide bombings as acts of terrorism have spurred some Muslims to provide scholastic refutations of suicide bombings and to condemn them. For example, Ihsanic Intelligence, a London-based Islamic think tank, published a study on suicide bombings that concluded, \"suicide bombing is anathema, antithetical and abhorrent to Sunni Islam. It is considered legally forbidden, constituting a reprehensible innovation in the Islamic tradition, morally an enormity of sin combining suicide and murder and theologically an act which has consequences of eternal damnation\".\n\nOxford-based Malaysian jurist Shaykh Afifi al-Akiti, issued his fatwa forbidding suicide bombing and targeting innocent civilians: \"If the attack involves a bomb placed on the body or placed so close to the bomber that when the bomber detonates it the bomber is certain [yaqin] to die, then the More Correct Position according to us is that it does constitute suicide. This is because the bomber, being also the Maqtul [the one killed], is unquestionably the same Qatil [the immediate\/active agent that kills] = Qatil Nafsahu [killing oneself, i.e., suicide].\"\n\nIn January 2006, a Shiite marja cleric, Ayatollah al-Udhma Yousof al-Sanei decreed a fatwa against suicide bombing declaring it as a \"terrorist act\" and the Saudi grand mufti as well as other Sunni scholars similarly denounced suicide attacks regardless of their offensive or defensive characterization.\n\nScholar Bernard Lewis states, \"At no time did the classical jurists offer any approval or legitimacy to what we nowadays call terrorism. Nor indeed is there any evidence of the use of terrorism as it is practiced nowadays\".  Similarly, Noah Feldman writes that the Islamic reasoning of suicide attackers is not convincing as martyrdom in Islam typically refers to another person killing a Muslim warrior, not the warrior pushing \"the button himself\".  In addition, \"The killing of women and children has proved harder to explain away as a permissible exercise of jihad.\" This \"illustrates the nature of the difficulty of reconciling suicide bombing with Islamic law\".\n\nAs Charles Kimball, the University of Oklahoma's Director of Religious Studies, pointed out that Islam \"clearly prohibits suicide\" by citing \"the hadith materials, which are the authoritative sayings and actions of the prophet, Muhammad, includes many unambiguous statements about suicide: one who 'throws himself off a mountain' or 'drinks poison' or 'kills himself with a sharp instrument' will be in the fire of Hell. Suicide is not allowed even to those in extreme conditions such as painful illness or a serious wound\". Other Islamic groups such as the European Council for Fatwa and Research cite the Quran'ic verse Al-An'am 6:151 as a prohibition against suicide: \"And take not life, which Allah has made sacred, except by way of justice and law\". Dr. Hassan Ali El-Najjar says that the hadith unambiguously forbid suicide.\n\n===Proponents of suicide operations===\n\nIslamist militant organisations (including Al-Qaeda, ISIL, Hamas and Islamic Jihad) continue to argue that suicide operations are justified according to Islamic law, despite Islam's strict prohibition of suicide and murder. Irshad Manji, in a conversation with one leader of Islamic Jihad noted their ideology.\n\n\"What's the difference between suicide, which the Koran condemns, and martyrdom?\" I asked. \"Suicide,\" he replied, \"is done out of despair. But remember: most of our martyrs today were very successful in their earthly lives.\" In short, there was a future to live for\u2014and they detonated it anyway.\n\nAnother rationale provided for why istishhad is not against Islamic law is that the civilians caught in the crossfire \"were destined to die\". The Saudi exile Muhammad al-Massari explains that any civilian killed in an attack on the enemy \"won't suffer [but instead]\u2026becomes a martyr himself\". During the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, Hezbollah secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah apologized for an attack on Nazareth that killed two Israeli-Arab children\u2014but said the two children should be considered \"martyrs\".\n\nFurther justifications have been given by Iranian cleric Ayatollah Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi, \"when protecting Islam and the Muslim community depends on martyrdom operations, it not only is allowed, but even is an obligation as many of the Shi'ah great scholars and Maraje', including Ayatullah Safi Golpayegani and Ayatullah Fazel Lankarani, have clearly announced in their fatwas\". Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran showered those who performed martyrdom operations during the Iran\u2013Iraq War and against Israel with accolades. Indeed, Sayyed Abbas al-Musawi, the second Secretary General of Hezbollah and student of Khomeini, created a supplication that became popular among the Hezbollah youths and fighters.\n\nOther clerics have supported suicide attacks largely in connection with the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. Sunni cleric Yusuf al-Qaradawi has supported such attacks by Palestinians in perceived defense of their homeland as heroic and an act of resistance.  Shiite Lebanese cleric Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, the spiritual authority recognized by Hezbollah, is reported to have similar views.\n\nAfter the 7 July 2005 London bombings, journalist Mona Eltahawy published an op-ed in the Washington Post noting the fact that there were \"22 imams and scholars who met at London's largest mosque to condemn the bombings but who would not criticize all suicide attacks\", such as Sayed Mohammed Musawi, the head of the World Islamic League, who said \"there should be a clear distinction between the suicide bombing of those who are trying to defend themselves from occupiers, which is something different from those who kill civilians, which is a big crime\". After the knighting of Salman Rushdie in June 2007, Pakistan's acting Minister of Religious Affairs Muhammad Ijaz-ul-Haq publicly justified and called for a suicide attack against him.\n \nThere have been conflicting reports about the stances of Sheikh Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy (who was then the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar- he is now deceased) and Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb (who was then the Grand Mufti of Egypt and is now the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar). Shortly after the September\u00a011 attacks Sheikh Tantawy issued a statement opposing suicide attacks. However, a translation from Al Azhar website quotes him as supporting suicide attacks on Jews in Israel as part of the Palestinian struggle \"to strike horror into the hearts of the enemies of Islam\". Yet, in 2003 he was quoted again as saying \"groups which carried out suicide bombings were the enemies of Islam\", and that all suicide attacks were sinful including those against Israelis. His comments condemning all suicide attacks were echoed by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Lebanese cleric Husam Qaraqirah.\n\n==Public opinion==\nIn addition to the views of Muslim theologians, conflicting viewpoints are apparent among the public in Muslim-majority countries. As a reporter for The Guardian notes in an article written during the second intifada in August 2001, the Muslim world celebrates \"martyr-bombers\" as heroes defending the things held sacred. Polls in the Middle East in August 2001 showed that 75% of people had been in favor of martyr-bombings.\n\nHowever, the Pew Research Center has found decreases in Muslim support for suicide attacks. In 2011 surveys, less than 15% of Pakistanis, Jordanians, Turks, and Indonesians thought that suicide bombings were sometimes\/often justified. Approximately 28% of Egyptians and 35% of Lebanese felt that suicide bombings were sometimes\/often justified.  However, 68% of Palestinians reported that suicide attacks were sometimes\/often justified. In 2013, Pew found that \"clear majorities of Muslims oppose violence in the name of Islam\"; 89% in Pakistan, 81% in Indonesia, 78% in Nigeria, and 77% in Tunisia said that \"suicide bombings or other acts of violence that target civilians are never justified\".\n\n==See also==\n* Child suicide bombers in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict\n* Female suicide bomber\n* Animal-borne bomb

{"title":"Fatwa on Terrorism","article":"The Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings is a 600-page (Urdu version), 512-page (English version) Islamic decree by scholar Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri which demonstrates from the Quran and Sunnah that terrorism and suicide bombings are unjust and evil, and thus un-Islamic. It was published in London as a book. The English edition was published in the UK by Minhaj-ul-Quran Publications. Qadri released the fatwa on 2 March 2010.\n\nThis fatwa is a direct refutation of the ideology of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. It is one of the most extensive Islamic anti-terrorism rulings, an \"absolute\" condemnation of terrorism without \"any excuses or pretexts\" which goes further than ever and declares that terrorism is kufr under Islamic law. The launch was organised by Minhaj-ul-Quran UK. Qadri said during the launch that \"Terrorism is terrorism, violence is violence and it has no place in Islamic teaching and no justification can be provided for it, or any kind of excuses or ifs or buts.\"\n\n\n==Overview==\nThe fatwa received widespread media attention and was positively covered by the international press.\n\nAccording to CNN, some experts see the fatwa as a significant blow to terrorist recruiting. CNN's Amanpour show added the fatwa summary to its website and declared it to be fatwa for peace, while the US State Department declares the fatwa to be significant step in taking Islam back from terrorists.\n\nBefore it had been released, Douglas Murray described the Fatwa on Terrorism, in an article in the Evening Standard, as \"potentially important\", although he said \"A single-fatwa will not change the level of denial and self criticism inherent in so much of modern Islam\".\n\nITV news channel questioned the credibility of the fatwa and asks if it was not by the British government because senior counter-terrorism officials from Scotland Yard and MI5 were present at the launch.\n\nThe 512-page English book version of the fatwa, Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings, (London: Minhaj-ul-Quran, 2011. ) has a foreword by John Esposito and an introduction by Joel Hayward, both of whom share Qadri's scholarly assessment that, regardless of any intention, the evil of terrorism remains evil and must be exposed, opposed and condemned.\n\nThe Fatwa on Terrorism has been officially endorsed by Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt. In January 2011, the fatwa was discussed at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2011. In June 2011, Pope Benedict XVI received a copy of the fatwa from representatives of Minhaj Interfaith Relations. The Pope reportedly appreciated that it promoted peace, harmony and interfaith dialogue.\n\nThe Fatwa on Terrorism was reviewed positively by Kemal Argon who published a review in The Journal of Rotterdam Islamic and Social Sciences, Vol. 2, No. 1, 2011, pp.\u00a0149\u2013160. Islamic University of Rotterdam, Netherlands.\n\n== See also ==\n\n*Minhaj-ul-Quran International\n*London Declaration for Global Peace and Resistance against Extremism 2011\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n*  Islamic scholar Tahir ul-Qadri issues terrorism fatwa\n*  Muslim leader's edict decries terrorism: U.S. hails 'taking back Islam'\n*  Tahir ul-Qadri and the difficulty of reporting on fatwas\n*  Global Media Coverage of Fatwa on Terrorism\n*  The Reality of Terrorism at WEF 2011\n*  The Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings \u2013 book details\n*  The Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings \u2013 free downloadable PDF\n*  Young Turks : Where are the Fatwas?\n*  VOA News: Fatwa Issued Against Terrorism\n*  NY Daily News : Top Muslim scholar launches 600-page jihad AGAINST terror\n*  The Hindu : Muslim scholar issues 'fatwa' condemning al-Qaeda terrorism\n*  Guardian UK: Fatwas can be a force for good\n*  One India News: Pakistani Islamic scholar to issue 600-page fatwa against terrorism, suicide bombing\n*  Intellectual Conservative: Muslim Cleric Issues Fatwa Against Terrorism\n*  Geo News: Tahir-ul-Qadri declares suicide attacks 'un-Islamic'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQadri at a news conference in London explaining the Fatwa on Terrorism.","urls":["http:\/\/www.minhajpublications.com\/?p=490","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20111129040856\/http:\/\/www.minhajpublications.com\/?p=490","https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/toronto\/influential-pakistani-cleric-based-in-gta-1.866827","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100402102656\/https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/toronto\/influential-pakistani-cleric-based-in-gta-1.866827","https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/uk\/home-news\/sheikh-issues-fatwa-against-all-terrorists-1915000.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110912181128\/http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/uk\/home-news\/sheikh-issues-fatwa-against-all-terrorists-1915000.html","http:\/\/blogs.reuters.com\/faithworld\/2010\/03\/02\/tahir-ul-qadri-and-the-difficulty-of-reporting-on-fatwas\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150202011906\/http:\/\/blogs.reuters.com\/faithworld\/2010\/03\/02\/tahir-ul-qadri-and-the-difficulty-of-reporting-on-fatwas\/","http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2010\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/03\/03\/terror.fatwa.analysis\/index.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20121108010752\/http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2010\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/03\/03\/terror.fatwa.analysis\/index.html","http:\/\/amanpour.blogs.cnn.com\/2010\/03\/11\/fatwa-for-peace\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150202001936\/http:\/\/amanpour.blogs.cnn.com\/2010\/03\/11\/fatwa-for-peace\/","http:\/\/www.washingtontimes.com\/news\/2010\/mar\/03\/muslim-leaders-edict-decries-terrorism\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150106192938\/http:\/\/www.washingtontimes.com\/news\/2010\/mar\/03\/muslim-leaders-edict-decries-terrorism\/","http:\/\/www.thisislondon.co.uk\/standard\/article-23810140-is-this-a-triumph-for-the-islamic-peacemakers.do","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20120122104015\/http:\/\/www.thisislondon.co.uk\/standard\/article-23810140-is-this-a-triumph-for-the-islamic-peacemakers.do","http:\/\/www.itv.com\/news\/fatwa-condemns-terror52128\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110606053826\/http:\/\/www.itv.com\/news\/fatwa-condemns-terror52128\/","http:\/\/www.minhajpublications.com\/?p=33","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110207225900\/http:\/\/www.minhajpublications.com\/?p=33","http:\/\/www.yanabi.com\/index.php?\/topic\/415493-drtahir-ul-qadris-histroic-fatwa-cetrtification-from-by-al-azhar-university","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150202011942\/http:\/\/www.yanabi.com\/index.php?%2Ftopic%2F415493-drtahir-ul-qadris-histroic-fatwa-cetrtification-from-by-al-azhar-university","http:\/\/www.minhajpublications.com\/?p=33","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110207225900\/http:\/\/www.minhajpublications.com\/?p=33","http:\/\/www.weforum.org\/sessions\/summary\/reality-terrorism","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150202011617\/http:\/\/www.weforum.org\/sessions\/summary\/reality-terrorism","http:\/\/www.nation.com.pk\/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online\/Regional\/Lahore\/24-Jun-2011\/Minhaj-man-meets-Pope","http:\/\/www.interfaithrelations.com\/english\/tid\/14224\/Fatwa-on-Terrorism-presented-to-Pope-Benedict-XVI-in-Vatican-City-Minhaj-man-Fatwa-on-Terrorism-and-Suicide-Bombings-issued-by-Shaykh-ul-Islam-Dr-Muhammad-Tahir-ul-Qadri","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150202002958\/http:\/\/www.interfaithrelations.com\/english\/tid\/14224\/Fatwa-on-Terrorism-presented-to-Pope-Benedict-XVI-in-Vatican-City-Minhaj-man-Fatwa-on-Terrorism-and-Suicide-Bombings-issued-by-Shaykh-ul-Islam-Dr-Muhammad-Tahir-ul-Qadri","http:\/\/www.fatwaonterrorism.com\/fatwa-on-terrorism\/fatwa-reviews\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150202002910\/http:\/\/www.fatwaonterrorism.com\/fatwa-on-terrorism\/fatwa-reviews\/"]}
{"title":"Wanganui Computer Centre bombing","article":"The Wanganui Computer Centre bombing occurred in Wanganui, New Zealand, in 1982. The event was carried out to protest New Zealand's ability to record the personal information of citizens which was seen as potentially dangerous by civil libertarians. The Computer Centre continued to operate until its closure in 2005.\n\n==Bombing==\n\nOn 18 November 1982, a suicide bomb attack was made against a facility housing the main computer system of the New Zealand Police, Courts, Ministry of Transport and other law enforcement agencies, in Wanganui. The force of the blast made it so that police were initially unable to determine the sex of the perpetrator. The attacker, a \"punk rock\" anarchist named Neil Roberts, was the only person killed, and the computer system was undamaged. He had written on a piece of cardboard before the explosion, \"Heres [sic] one anarchist down. Hopefully there\u2019s a lot more waking up. One day we\u2019ll win - one day.\u201d A public toilet nearby had the slogan \"We have maintained a silence closely resembling stupidity\" painted on it, a slogan which the police believe Roberts had painted, and borrowed from the Revolutionary Proclamation of the Junta Tuitiva of 1809. The phrase is still closely linked with the bombing by the New Zealand public. \n\n==In popular culture==\nIn 1984, a short was produced titled The Maintenance of Silence. The film portrays a young man named Eric probing into the facts of the bombing. The protagonist is disturbed by being awakened in Auckland at the exact moment of the bombing in Wanganui. Eric becomes absorbed in pondering the character and fate of Neil Roberts. \n\nRochelle Bright wrote a musical play about Neil Roberts in 2015 as part of her residency at the Michael King Writers' Centre in Auckland. \n\nThe graffitied sentence \"We have maintained a silence closely resembling stupidity\" has been used by New Zealand artist Ann Shelton in various works, notably as part of her \"Doublethink\" installation (2013) and exhibition \"The City of Lead and Gold\" (Sarjeant Gallery, Wanganui, 2013).\n\n==See also==\n* Terrorism in New Zealand\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/www.TeAra.govt.nz\/en\/photograph\/34659\/bomb-damage-to-the-wanganui-computer-centre-1982","http:\/\/www.radionz.co.nz\/national\/programmes\/morningreport\/audio\/20159086\/wanganui-computer-centre-explosion-news-report","http:\/\/libcom.org\/library\/neil-roberts-wanganui-police-bomb","http:\/\/punkfest.orcon.net.nz\/index2002.htm","http:\/\/thewireless.co.nz\/articles\/an-anarchist-with-a-death-wish","https:\/\/www.nzonscreen.com\/title\/the-maintenance-of-silence-1985\/quotes","https:\/\/www.stuff.co.nz\/entertainment\/music\/63097477\/null","https:\/\/ojs.victoria.ac.nz\/jnzs\/article\/viewFile\/6\/5","https:\/\/www.stuff.co.nz\/entertainment\/stage-and-theatre\/76343127\/null","http:\/\/www.annshelton.com\/works\/the-city-of-gold-and-lead"]}

{"title":"2005 Netrokona bombing","article":"2005 Netrokona bombing was a bomb attack on 8 December 2005 at a meeting of Bangladesh Udichi Shilpigoshthi in Netrokona, Bangladesh that resulted in the deaths of eight people. It was carried out by the Islamist Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh who have in the past bombed courts demanding Sharia law.\n\n==Attacks==\nOn 8 December 2005, Bangladesh Udichi Shilpigoshthi, a secular cultural organisation, had organised a cultural program.  A suicide bomber of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh attacked the event killing eight people including two police officers. Two suicide bombers were also killed in the bombing. The joint convenor of Udichi in Netrokona, Khaja Haider Hossain, was killed in the attack. Two of the victims died in Netrokona Sadar Hospital and three others died in Mymensingh Medical College Hospital.\n\nThe Bangladesh Nationalist Party led government tried to blame the attack on a Hindu man, Yadav Das, who was killed in the explosion.  This was criticised by both the local people and the opposition Bangladesh Awami League. State Minister for Home Affairs Lutfozzaman Babar first called Yadav an Hindu extremist but on 15 December 2005 rescinded his statement and said Yadav was innocent.\n\n==Trial==\nOn 17 February 2008 a Dhaka Court sentenced to death, Asaduzzaman Chowdhury alias Panir, Salahuddin alias Saleheen, and Yunus Ali.

{"title":"1992 attack on Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires","article":"The attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires was a suicide bombing attack on the building of the Israeli embassy of Argentina, located in Buenos Aires, which was carried out on 17 March 1992. 29 civilians were killed in the attack and 242 additional civilians were injured.\n\n==The attack==\n\nOn 17 March 1992, at 2:42 pm (UTC\u22123), a pick-up truck driven by a suicide bomber and loaded with explosives smashed into the front of the Israeli Embassy located on the corner of Arroyo and Suipacha, and detonated. The embassy, a Catholic church, and a nearby school building were destroyed. Four Israelis died, but most of the victims were Argentine civilians, many of them children. The blast killed 29 and wounded 242. It was Argentina's deadliest terror attack until the 1994 AMIA bombing and it remains the deadliest attack on an Israeli diplomatic mission.\n\n===Fatalities===\nPriest Juan Carlos Brumana was one of the people killed in the suicide bombing. He died in the Catholic Church Mater Admirabilis that is in front of the embassy. Among the dead there were two Israeli women who were the wives of the embassy's consul and first secretary.\n\n==Responsibility==\nA group called Islamic Jihad Organization, which has been linked to Iran and possibly Hezbollah, claimed responsibility; their stated motive for the attack was Israel's assassination of Hezbollah Secretary General Sayed Abbas al-Musawi in February 1992. Islamic Jihad also released surveillance footage they took of the embassy before the blast.\n\nAfter the bombing, Israel sent investigators to Argentina to search for clues. They learned that the bombers planned the attack in the Tri-Border area, where the borders of Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil meet and which has a large Muslim population. Messages intercepted by the American National Security Agency revealed Iranian knowledge of the impending attack, as well as the complicity of Hezbollah operative Imad Mughniyah. In fact, Mughniyah was formally charged by Argentina with participating in the bombings of the Israeli embassy.\n\nIn May 1998, Moshen Rabbani (the Cultural Attach\u00e9 in the Iranian Embassy in Argentina until December 1997) was detained in Germany, and the Argentine government expelled seven Iranian diplomats from the country, stating that it had \"convincing proof\" of Iranian involvement in the bombing. However, none of the suspects were prosecuted. The attack occurred when Iran and Argentina were hoping for a resumption of nuclear cooperation, although Argentina had announced the suspension of the shipments of nuclear materials to Iran a couple months before the bombing. A number of sources report on Hezbollah involvement with the assistance of Syria. Hezbollah denies these claims.\n\nIn 1999, the Argentine government issued an arrest warrant for Imad Mughniyah in connection with this attack and the 1994 AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires, which killed 85. It is suspected that the two attacks are linked.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n\n===Kirchner on the case===\nWhen he was president, N\u00e9stor Kirchner pronounced that allowing these two incidents to happen, with no real inquiries to be followed, equalled a \"national disgrace\". He reopened, and kept open files from these incidents, most to be read by Justice Juan Jose Galeano. In the same process Kirchner hoped to lift the ban for former Intelligence Officers (Argentine) to testify. A former president of Argentina (his widow, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner) also claimed that she wanted to get to the bottom of the case. Argentinian federal prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, was assigned to investigate the bombing, but one day before he was scheduled to report on his findings, he was found dead in his home on 18 January 2015.\n\n===Commemoration===\nToday there is a memorial set up in place of where the building stood. In the memorial plaza stand twenty one trees and seven benches in memory of the victims. A plaque describing the event and listing the victims is located in the memorial in both Hebrew and Spanish.\n\n\nPlaza Embajada de Israel.jpg|The memorial to the victims of the bombing\nPlaza Embajada de Israel Trees.jpg|The memorial to the victims of the bombing\nFile:Plaza de la Memoria ID 198.jpg|The memorial to the victims of the bombing\n\n\n==See also==\n\n*Terrorism in Argentina\n*Secretariat of Intelligence\n*Alas Chiricanas Flight 901, a bomb brought down a Panamanian plane the day after the AMIA bombing, dead included 12 Jews\n*History of the Jews in Argentina\n*Argentina\u2013Israel relations\n*1994 London Israeli Embassy bombing\n\n==References==\n\n\n==Sources==\n*Bergman, Ronen.

{"title":"Riyadh compound bombings","article":"Two major bombings took place in residential compounds in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in 2003. On 12 May 2003, 39 people were killed, and over 160 wounded when bombs went off at three compounds in Riyadh\u2014Dorrat Al Jadawel, Al Hamra Oasis Village, and the Vinnell Corporation Compound. On 8 November, a bomb was detonated outside the Al-Mohaya housing compound west of Riyadh, killing at least 17 people and wounding 122.\n\nThe bombings have been attributed to Islamic extremists as part of a campaign against Westerners and Westernization in Saudi Arabia. They are thought to have been sparked by the stationing of US troops in Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf War with Iraq.\n\n==Prelude==\nA smaller campaign of insurgency in Saudi Arabia had begun in November 2000 when car bombings were carried out targeting and killing individual expatriates in Riyadh and other cities. As early as February 2003, the US State Department issued travel warnings that Westerners could be targeted by terrorists. The warnings followed an explosion at a private residence where weapons, explosives, cash, and false documents were subsequently discovered. In early May 2003, the US State Department warned that terrorists were in the final stages of planning terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia.  The Saudi government also warned of this, and issued an alert for 19 men believed to be members of Al-Qaeda planning attacks.\n\n==May attack==\nLate on 12 May, several vehicles manned by heavily armed assault teams arrived at three Riyadh compounds: The Dorrat Al Jadawel, a compound owned by the London-based MBI International and Partners subsidiary Jadawel International, the Al Hamra Oasis Village, and the Vinnell Corporation Compound, occupied by a Virginia-based defense contractor that was training the Saudi National Guard.  All contained large numbers of Americans, Westerners, and non-Saudi Arabs.\n\nAround 11:15 pm, multiple gunmen infiltrated the Al Hamra Oasis Village, a site inhabited mainly by Westerners. They killed the guards at the gate and proceeded to open fire at residents, killing Westerners, non-Saudi Arabs, and Saudis and the assailants then detonated a car bomb. The next attack was at the Jadawel compound, though the assailants failed to gain access to the compound due to the prominent level of security. There was a shootout between security personnel and terrorists on approach to the front gates. The terrorists then detonated a two-ton truck bomb outside the area killing themselves, two security guards and injuring many others.\n\nThe final target was the Vinnell compound. The Terrorist Team approached the gate in a sedan, with a pickup truck carrying the explosives following. Those in the sedan shot the Saudi soldiers guarding the gate and then opened the gate for the pickup truck. The truck was driven to the front of one of the residential high rises on the compound, and detonated. At the time, many of the Vinnell employees were away from the compound, supporting an exercise for the National Guard. Seven Americans were killed or died of injuries the night of the attack, along with two Filipino employees. An eighth American died in hospital several days later. Some of the terrorist assault team died when the truck bomb was detonated, and others escaped by climbing over the compound wall.\n\n===Questions about inside actors===\nAccording to American intelligence sources, the bombers operation \"depended on a significant level of `insider` knowledge of the compounds.\"  According to one American military official quoted by the Daily Telegraph, it took the bombers \n(...) 30 seconds to a minute to get from the gate to the housing block. They had to know where the switches were to operate the gates after attacking the guards. They then drove at breakneck speed with a bomb weighing nearly 200 kilograms to the most intensely populated location in the complex and blew it up. \"Several bombers\" were wearing uniforms of the National Guard to help them get into the three bombed complexes. The intelligence officials believe that al-Qaeda has infiltrated even the elite National Guard, which is involved in compound security.\n\n===Reaction===\nIn the immediate aftermath of the May bombing a large number of Western expatriates left Saudi Arabia. Airlines reported a \"flood of bookings for flights from Saudi Arabia to Britain and America\". There were also bomb scares and an evacuation of one compound near those attacked and at the landmark Faisaliya Tower.\n\nThe attacks were denounced by then-US President George W. Bush as \"ruthless murder\" and by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah as the work of \"monsters.\" Abdullah vowed to destroy the terrorist group that ordered them, and the Saudi government began a harsh crackdown on the insurgency, arresting more than 600 terrorist suspects and seizing bomb-making materials, bomb belts, and thousands of weapons.\n\nOn 7 June 2003, an official Saudi statement identified twelve men as the perpetrators of this attack. According to that statement, the identification was based on DNA found at the scene. The names were Al-Qaeda member Khaled Muhammad bin Muslim Al-Arawi Al-Juhani, Muhammed Othman Abdullah Al-Walidi Al-Shehri, Hani Saeed Ahmad Al Abdul-Karim Al-Ghamdi, Jubran Ali Ahmad Hakami Khabrani, Khaled bin Ibrahim Mahmoud, Mehmas bin Muhammed Mehmas Al-Hawashleh Al-Dosari, Muhammed bin Shadhaf Ali Al-Mahzoum Al-Shehri, Hazem Muhammed Saeed Kashmiri, Majed Abdullah Sa'ad bin Okail, Bandar bin Abdul-Rahman Menawer Al-Rahimi Al-Mutairi, Abdul-Karim Muhammed Jubran Yazji, and Abdullah Farres bin Jufain Al-Rahimi Al-Mutairi.\n\nAbdul Rahman Jabarah was killed in a gunfight with Saudi security forces, as was Zubayr Al-Rimi. Both men were believed to have had involvement in the attack.\n\nSaif al-Adel and Saad bin Laden were implicated in the attacks. According to Seth G. Jones, the bombings were planned by al Qaeda in Iran, with apparent Iranian complicity. In May 2003, then-State Department official Ryan Crocker provided information on the upcoming attack to Iranian officials, who apparently took no action. However, according to an interrogation of former al-Qaeda spokesman Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, al-Adel and Saad were being held prisoner in Iran when the attacks took place. Saad was killed in a drone strike in Pakistan in 2009.\n\n===Casualties===\nIn the compound bombings, reportedly at least 27 people died from several different countries:\n\n\n\nIn addition, twelve suicide bombers died, bringing the entire toll from the attacks to 39. More than 160 other people were injured, including more than two dozen Americans.\n\nIn October 2003, as-Sahab released the videotaped wills of the bombers Abu Umar al-Ta'ifi (also known as Hamza al-Ansari), Muhammad bin Shazzaf al-Shahri (also known as Abu Tareq al-Aswad) and Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhab al-Maqit, recorded two weeks before the attacks.\n\n==November attack==\n\n\nOn 8 November, a suicide truck bomb detonated outside the Al-Mohaya housing compound in Laban Valley, West of Riyadh, killing at least 17 people and wounding 122, among them 36 children. Those killed in the attack were mainly Arabs, many of them workers from countries such as Egypt and Lebanon. Among the injured were people from India, Bangladesh, Philippines, and Eritrea.  (The US State Department had warned of further attacks in the Kingdom on the day of the attack.)\n\n===Questions about inside actors===\nAccording to the Saudi Press Agency, suicide bombers posing as guards drove into the compound in a vehicle which \"looked like a police car\", and after an exchange of gunfire with security forces blew themselves up\u2014the compound allegedly chosen by them because those occupied by Western expatriates were too well guarded. However, journalist John R. Bradley noted that none of the suicide bombers were identified by the government, and that despite official reports of gunfire before the bombing\u2014and thus presumably casualties among security forces\u2014there were no televised visits by Interior Minister Prince Naif to homes of members of those forces, as is customary when members are killed in an attack.\n\nBradley reports that in an alternative version of the bombing\u2014provided to him by Saudi opposition figures with sources among disgruntled members of the security forces and government\u2014the police car was \"in fact ... a car belonging to the Saudi special security forces,\" and that the bomb was not detonated in suicide but by remote control, its detonators escaping unharmed. Thus, attackers dressed as policemen, driving a special security forces car, taking care not to kill any of those defending the compound, and apparently not themselves being fired upon with any degree of accuracy [meant that] There could not be greater evidence, if even only half of that proved true, that Al-Qaeda had infiltrated Saudi Arabia's military and security forces, including those entrusted with the protection of residential compounds.\n\n\nAccording to Bradley, surviving residents of the compound stated that three months before the bombing Saudi religious police accompanied by regular Saudi police, had visited them\u2014a rare intrusion into the \"refuge from Saudi morality that the compounds are supposed to provide\". The police had warned the residents that their \"Westernized lifestyle\" was \"under scrutiny\".  It was an \"open secret\", according to Bradley, that many of the religious police supported Osama bin Laden.\n\n==See also==\n\n*Terrorism in Saudi Arabia\n*Khobar Towers bombing (1996)\n*Khobar massacres (2004)\n*The Kingdom, a 2007 film that draws from the bombing as inspiration for its plot.\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n*  Shock and Fear in Riyadh (CBS News)","urls":["https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/jihadinsaudi_hegg_2010_000_10552999\/page\/n171","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/jihadinsaudi_hegg_2010_000_10552999","http:\/\/www.susris.com\/articles\/2003\/ioi\/030510-saudi-terror.html","https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2003\/WORLD\/meast\/05\/13\/Saudi.jadawel\/index.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20120118035621\/http:\/\/articles.cnn.com\/2003-05-13\/world\/Saudi.jadawel_1_jadawel-compound-al-hamra-oasis-village-car-bomb?_s=PM:WORLD","http:\/\/www.strategypage.com\/dls\/articles2003\/20030903.asp","https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/expat\/expatnews\/4187344\/Bomber-moles-in-Saudi-forces.html","http:\/\/www.kuna.net.kw\/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=1345288&language=en","http:\/\/www.arabnews.com\/node\/239296","http:\/\/saudinf.com\/main\/y5802.htm","http:\/\/www.longwarjournal.org\/archives\/2011\/05\/analysis_al_qaedas_i.php","http:\/\/www.foreignaffairs.com\/articles\/137061\/seth-g-jones\/al-qaeda-in-iran","http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2013\/03\/10\/opinion\/bergen-iran-al-qaeda\/","http:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/2013\/09\/30\/the-shadow-commander?currentPage=all","http:\/\/kronosadvisory.com\/Kronos_US_v_Sulaiman_Abu_Ghayth_Statement.1.pdf<\/ref>","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/americas\/8164763.stm","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2003\/WORLD\/meast\/05\/14\/saudiblast.intl\/index.html","https:\/\/archive.is\/20130119114114\/http:\/\/articles.cnn.com\/2003-05-14\/world\/saudiblast.intl_1_car-bombings-saudi-authorities-saudi-arabia?_s=PM:WORLD","http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2003\/WORLD\/meast\/06\/01\/saudi.blast\/index.html?_s=PM:WORLD","https:\/\/archive.is\/20130119161548\/http:\/\/articles.cnn.com\/2003-06-01\/world\/saudi.blast_1_interior-minister-prince-nayef-suicide-bombings-al-qaeda-terror-network?_s=PM:WORLD","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2003\/WORLD\/meast\/11\/09\/saudi.explosion\/index.html","http:\/\/newsmine.org\/content.php?ol=war-on-terror\/saudi-arabia\/nov03-suicide-attack-kills-11.txt","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2003\/WORLD\/meast\/11\/09\/saudi.explosion\/index.html","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/middle_east\/3254385.stm","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/saudiarabiaexpos00brad","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/saudiarabiaexpos00brad\/page\/113","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/saudiarabiaexpos00brad"]}
{"title":"Bath School disaster","article":"The Bath School disaster, also known as the Bath School massacre, was a series of violent attacks perpetrated by Andrew Kehoe on May18, 1927, in Bath Township, Michigan, United States. The attacks killed 38\u00a0elementary schoolchildren and 6\u00a0adults, and injured at least 58\u00a0other people. Prior to his timed explosives going off at the Bath Consolidated School building, Kehoe had murdered his wife, Nellie Price Kehoe, and firebombed his farm. Arriving at the site of the school explosion, Kehoe died when he detonated explosives concealed in his truck.\n\nKehoe, the 55-year-old school board treasurer, was angered by increased taxes and his defeat in the April 5, 1926, election for township clerk. He was thought by locals to have planned his \"murderous revenge\" after that public defeat. Kehoe had a reputation for difficulty on the school board and in personal dealings. In addition, he was notified in June 1926 that his mortgage was going to be foreclosed upon. For much of the next year until May 1927, Kehoe purchased explosives. He secretly hid them on his property and under the school.\n\nOn May 18, 1927, Kehoe then set off almost simultaneous explosions at his farmstead and at the Bath Consolidated School. His devices destroyed the farm's buildings and ripped through the north wing of the Bath Consolidated School building. As rescuers began working at the school, Kehoe drove up to the schoolyard and detonated dynamite inside his shrapnel-filled truck. The truck explosion killed Kehoe plus four other people, and also injured bystanders. During the rescue and recovery efforts, searchers discovered an additional 500\u00a0pounds (230\u00a0kg) of unexploded dynamite and pyrotol in the south wing of the school that had been set to go off at the same time as the initial explosions in the north wing; Kehoe had apparently intended to destroy the entire school and kill everyone in it.\n\n==Background==\n===Bath Township===\nBath Township is a civil township located  northeast of the city of Lansing in the US state of Michigan. The township covers  and the small unincorporated village of Bath is within its borders. The township itself is within Clinton County, Michigan, an area of some . In the early 1920s the area was primarily agricultural. After years of debate, Bath Township voters approved the creation of the Bath Consolidated School district in 1922, along with an increase in township property taxes to pay for a new school. When the school opened, it had 236\u00a0students enrolled in grades\u00a01 to grade 12. The school's creation was controversial, but Monty Ellsworth wrote in his book about the disaster that consolidated schools had great advantages over the smaller rural schools they replaced. All landowners within the township area had to pay higher ad valorem property taxes. At the time of the bombing, the unincorporated village had about 300\u00a0adult residents.\n\n===Andrew Kehoe===\n\n\nAndrew Philip Kehoe was born in Tecumseh, Michigan, on February 1, 1872, into a family of 13\u00a0children and attended the local high school. After graduating, Kehoe studied electrical engineering at Michigan State College in East Lansing and moved to St. Louis, where he worked as an electrician for several years. Sometime during this period he suffered a head injury in a fall and was semi-conscious or in a coma for a period of several weeks. He later returned to Michigan and his father's farm.\n\nAfter his mother's death, Kehoe's father Philip married a much younger widow, Frances Wilder, and a daughter was born. On September 17, 1911, as his stepmother attempted to light the family's oil stove, it exploded and set her on fire. Kehoe threw a bucket of water on her, but the fire was oil-based and his action spread the flames more rapidly, which engulfed and immolated her body. The injuries were fatal and she died the next day. Some of Kehoe's later neighbors in Bath believed that he had caused the stove explosion.\n\nKehoe married Ellen \"Nellie\" Price in 1912 at the age of 40. Seven years later, they moved to a farm outside Bath. Kehoe was said to be dependable, doing favors and volunteer work for his neighbors. He was also described as being notoriously impatient with any disagreement; and he had shot and killed a neighbor's dog that had come on his property and annoyed him by barking. He had beaten one of his horses to death when it did not perform to his expectations.\n\nKehoe had a reputation for frugality, and was elected in 1924 as a trustee on the school board for three years and treasurer for one year. He argued strongly for lower taxes, and later superintendent of the board M.\u00a0W. Keys said that he \"fought the expenditure of money for the most necessary equipment\". Kehoe was considered difficult to work with, often voting against the rest of the board, wanting his own way and arguing with the township financial authorities. He protested that he paid too much in taxes and tried to get the valuation of his property reduced so he would pay less. In 1922, the Bath Township school tax was $12.26 on a thousand dollars valuation (with the valuation on Kehoe's farm being ten thousand dollars). In 1923 the school board raised the tax to $18.80 per thousand dollar valuation and in 1926 the taxes went up to $19.80. This meant that Kehoe's tax liability went from $122.60 in 1922 to $198.00 in 1926. In June 1926 Kehoe was notified that the widow of his wife's uncle, who held the mortgage on his property, had begun foreclosure proceedings. Following the disaster Sheriff Fox, who had served the foreclosure notice, reported that Kehoe had muttered \"If it hadn't been for that $300 school tax. I might have paid off this mortgage.\" Mrs. Price, the mortgage holder, also reported that Kehoe had stated \"If I can't live in that house, no one else will.\" when she had mentioned foreclosure to him.\n\nKehoe was appointed in 1925 to temporarily fill the position of town clerk, but he was defeated in the April 1926 election. This public rejection by the community angered him. Ellsworth wrote that he thought that this defeat was the reason why Kehoe had planned his \"murderous revenge\"; using the bombings to destroy the Bath Consolidated School and kill the community's children and many of its members. In Bath Massacre, Arnie Bernstein cites Robert D. Hare's Psychopathy Checklist and says that Andrew Kehoe \"fits the profile all too well\".\n\nKehoe's neighbor A. McMullen noted that Kehoe had stopped working on his farm altogether for most of the preceding year, and he had speculated that Kehoe might be planning suicide. Kehoe had given him one of his horses about April 1927, but McMullen returned it for this reason. It was discovered later that Kehoe had cut all his wire fences as part of his preparations to destroy his farm, girdling young shade trees to kill them and cutting off his grapevine plants before putting them back on their stumps to hide the damage. He gathered lumber and other materials and put them in the tool shed which he later destroyed with an incendiary bomb.\n\nBy the time of the bombing, Nellie Kehoe had become chronically ill with what resembled tuberculosis, for which there was no effective treatment or cure at the time. Her frequent hospital stays may have contributed to the family's debt. Kehoe had ceased making mortgage and homeowner's insurance payments months earlier.\n\n===Purchase and planting of school explosives===\n\nThere is no clear indication of when Kehoe conceived the idea of massacring the schoolchildren and townspeople, but Ellsworth, who was a neighbor, thought that Kehoe conceived his plan after being defeated in the April 5, 1926, township clerk election. The general consensus of the townspeople was that he had worked on his plan at least since the previous August. Bath School Board member M.\u00a0W. Keyes was quoted by The New York Times:\nKehoe had free access to the school building during the summer vacation of 1926. From mid-1926, he began buying more than a ton of pyrotol, an incendiary explosive used by farmers during the era for excavation and burning debris. In November 1926, he drove to Lansing and bought two boxes of dynamite at a sporting goods store. Dynamite was also commonly used on farms, so his purchase of small amounts of explosives at different stores and on different dates did not raise any suspicions. Neighbors reported hearing explosions set off on the farm, with one calling him \"the dynamite farmer\". Following the disaster it was reported that Michigan State Police investigators had discovered that a considerable amount of dynamite had been stolen from a bridge construction site and that Andrew Kehoe was suspected of the theft. Investigators also recovered a container of gasoline in the school's basement. The container was rigged with a tube and investigators speculated that Kehoe had planned that the gasoline fumes would ignite from a spark scattering burning gasoline throughout the basement. In the undamaged section of the school it was found that Kehoe had concealed the explosives in six lengths of eavestrough pipe, three bamboo fishing rods and what were described as \"windmill rods\" that were placed in the basement ceiling.\nKehoe purchased a .30-caliber Winchester bolt-action rifle in December 1926, according to the testimony of Lieutenant Lyle Morse, a Michigan State Police investigator with the Department of Public Safety.\n\n===Further preparations===\n\nPrior to May18, Kehoe had loaded the back seat of his truck with metal debris capable of producing shrapnel during an explosion. He also bought a new set of tires for his truck to avoid breaking down when transporting the explosives. He made many trips to Lansing for more explosives, as well as to the school, town, and his house. Ida Hall, who lived in a house next to the school, saw activity around the building on different nights during May. Early one morning after midnight she saw a man carrying objects inside. She also saw vehicles around the building several times late at night. Hall mentioned these events to a relative but they were never reported to police.\n\nNellie was discharged from Lansing's St. Lawrence Hospital on May16, and was murdered by her husband some time between her release and the bombings two days later. Kehoe put her body in a wheelbarrow at the rear of the farm's chicken coop, where it was found in a heavily charred condition after the farm explosions and fire. Piled around the cart were silverware and a metal cash box. The ashes of several banknotes could be seen through a slit in the cash box. Kehoe placed and wired homemade pyrotol firebombs in the house and throughout the farm buildings.\n\n==Day of the disaster==\n===Farm bombs===\n\nAt approximately 8:45\u00a0a.m. on Wednesday, May 18, Kehoe detonated the firebombs in his house and farm buildings, causing some debris to fly into a neighbor's poultry brooding house. Neighbors noticed the fire, and volunteers rushed to the scene.\n\nO.\u00a0H. Bush and several other men crawled through a broken window of the farmhouse in search of survivors. When they found no one in the house, they salvaged what furniture they could before the fire spread into the living room. Bush discovered dynamite in the corner; he picked up an armful of explosives and handed it to one of the men. As Kehoe left the burning property in his Ford truck, he stopped to tell those fighting the fire that they should get to the school and then drove off.\n\n===North wing explosion===\n\nClasses at Bath Consolidated School began at 8:30\u00a0a.m. Kehoe had set an alarm clock in the basement of the north wing of the school which detonated the dynamite and pyrotol he had hidden there at about 8:45\u00a0a.m. Rescuers heading to the scene of the Kehoe farm fire heard the explosion at the school building and turned back in that direction. Parents within the rural community rushed to the school. The school building resembled a war zone, with 38 people killed in the initial explosion, mostly children.\n\nEyewitnesses and survivors were interviewed afterwards by newspaper reporters. First-grade teacher Bernice Sterling told an Associated Press reporter that the explosion was like an earthquake: \"...the air seemed to be full of children and flying desks and books. Children were tossed high in the air; some were catapulted out of the building.\" Eyewitness Robert Gates said the scene was pure chaos at the school:\n\nEllsworth recounted: \"I saw one mother, Mrs. Eugene Hart, sitting on the bank a short distance from the school with a little dead girl on each side of her and holding a little boy, Percy, who died a short time after they got him to the hospital. This was about the time Kehoe blew his car up in the street, severely wounding Perry, the oldest child of Mr. and Mrs. Hart.\"\n\nThe north wing of the school had collapsed, leaving the edge of the roof on the ground. Ellsworth recalled that \"there was a pile of children of about five or six under the roof\". He volunteered to drive back to his farm and get a rope heavy enough to pull the school roof off the children's bodies. Returning to his farm, he saw Kehoe driving in the opposite direction, heading toward the school. \"He grinned and waved his hand,\" Ellsworth said. \"When he grinned, I could see both rows of his teeth.\"\n\n===Truck explosion===\n\nKehoe drove up to the school about half an hour after the first explosion. He saw Superintendent Huyck and summoned him over to his truck. Charles Hawson testified at the inquest that he saw the two men grapple over some type of long gun before Kehoe detonated the dynamite stored in his truck, immediately killing himself; Huyck; Nelson McFarren, a retired farmer; and Cleo Clayton, an 8-year-old second grader. Clayton had survived the first blast and then wandered out of the school building; he was killed by fragmentation from the exploding vehicle.\n\nThe truck explosion spread debris over a large area and caused extensive damage to cars parked a half-block away, with their roofs catching on fire from the burning gasoline. It injured several others and mortally wounded postmaster Glenn O. Smith, who lost a leg and died before making it to the hospital. O.\u00a0H. Bush recalled that one of his crew bound up \"the wounds of Glenn Smith, the postmaster. His leg had been blown off.\"\n\n===Recovery and rescue===\nTelephone operators stayed at their stations for hours to summon doctors, undertakers, area hospital workers, and anyone else who might help. The Lansing Fire Department sent several firefighters and its chief. Local physician J.\u00a0A. Crum and his wife, a nurse, who had both served in World War I, turned their Bath drugstore into a triage center. The dead bodies were taken to the town hall, which was used as a morgue.\n\nHundreds of people worked in the wreckage all day and into the night in an effort to find and rescue any children pinned underneath. Area contractors sent all their men to assist, and many other people came to the scene in response to pleas for help. Eventually, 34 firefighters and the chief of the Lansing Fire Department arrived, as did several Michigan State Police officers who managed traffic to and from the scene. The injured and dying were transported to Sparrow Hospital and St. Lawrence Hospital in Lansing. The construction of the St. Lawrence facility had been financed in large part by Lawrence Price, Nellie Kehoe's uncle and formerly an executive in charge of Oldsmobile's Lansing Car Assembly. Michigan Governor Fred W. Green arrived during the afternoon of the disaster and assisted in the relief work, carting bricks away from the scene. The Lawrence Baking Company of Lansing sent a truck filled with pies and sandwiches which were served to rescuers in the township's community hall.\n\n\nDuring the search for survivors and victims, rescuers found an additional 500\u00a0pounds (230\u00a0kg) of dynamite which had failed to detonate in the south wing of the school. The search was halted to allow the Michigan State Police to disarm the devices, and they found an alarm clock timed to go off at 8:45\u00a0a.m. Investigators speculated that the initial explosion may have caused a short circuit in the second set of bombs, preventing them from detonating. They searched the building and then returned to the recovery work.\n\nPolice and fire officials gathered at the Kehoe farm to investigate the fires. State troopers had searched for Nellie Kehoe throughout Michigan, thinking that she was at a tuberculosis sanatorium, but her charred remains were found the day after the disaster, among the ruins of the farm. All the Kehoe farm buildings were destroyed. Kehoe's two horses had burned to death, trapped inside the barn. Their carcasses were found with their legs hobbled together with wire, preventing their escape or rescue when the farm's buildings blew up and caught fire. Investigators found a wooden sign wired to the farm's fence with Kehoe's last message stenciled on it: \"Criminals are made, not born\".\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nThe American Red Cross set up an operations center at the Crum drugstore and took the lead in providing aid and comfort to the victims. The Lansing Red Cross headquarters stayed open until 11:30\u00a0that night to answer telephone calls, update the list of dead and injured, and provide information and planning services for the following day. The local community responded generously, as reported at the time by the Associated Press: \"a sympathetic public assured the rehabilitation of the stricken community. Aid was tendered freely in the hope that the grief of those who lost loved ones might be even slightly mitigated.\" The Red Cross managed donations sent to pay for both the medical expenses of the survivors and the burial costs of the dead. In a few weeks, US$5,284.15\n() was raised through donations, including $2,500 from the Clinton County Board of Supervisors and $2,000 from the Michigan Legislature.\n\nThe disaster received nationwide coverage in the days following, sharing headlines with Charles Lindbergh's trans-Atlantic crossing (though Lindbergh's crossing received much more attention) and eliciting a national outpouring of grief. Newspaper headlines from across the United States characterized Kehoe as a maniac, a madman, and a fiend.\n\nPeople from across the world expressed sympathy to the families and the community of Bath, including letters from some Italian schoolchildren. One 5th\u00a0grade class wrote: \"Even if we are small, we understand all the sorrow and misfortune that has struck our dear brothers.\" Another Italian class wrote: \"We are praying to God to give to the unfortunate mothers and fathers, the strength to bear the great sorrow that has descent on them, we are near to you in spirit.\"\n\nKehoe's body was claimed by one of his sisters and his body was buried in an unmarked grave in the paupers' section of Mount Rest Cemetery in St. Johns, Michigan. The Price family buried Nellie Price Kehoe in a Lansing cemetery under her maiden name.\n\nVehicles from outlying areas and surrounding states descended upon Bath by the thousands. Over 100,000 vehicles passed through on Saturday alone, an enormous amount of traffic for the area. Some Bath citizens regarded this as an unwarranted intrusion into their time of grief, but most accepted it as a show of sympathy and support from surrounding communities. Burials of individual victims started that Friday, two days after the disaster. Funerals and burials continued on Saturday and Sunday until all the dead were buried. For a time following the tragedy the town and Kehoe's burned-out farm continued to attract curiosity seekers.\n\n===Coroner's inquest===\nThe coroner arrived at the scene on the day of the disaster and swore in six community leaders that afternoon to serve as a jury investigating the death of Superintendent Huyck. Informal testimony had been taken on May 19 and the formal coroner's inquest started on May 23. The Clinton County prosecutor conducted the examination, and more than 50 people testified before the jury. During his testimony, David Hart stated that Kehoe had told him that he had \"killed a horse\" and The New York Times reported people as saying that Kehoe had \"an ungovernable temper\" and \"seemed to have a mania for killing things\". Neighbors testified that he had been wiring the buildings at his farm about that time and that he was evasive about his reasons.\n\nKehoe's neighbor Sidney J. Howell testified that after the fire began at the Kehoe farm, Kehoe warned him and three men to leave there, saying, \"Boys, you are my friends, you better get out of here, you better go down to the school.\" Three telephone linemen working near Bath testified that Kehoe passed them in his truck on the road toward the school, and they saw him arrive there. His truck swerved and stopped in front of the building. In the next instant, according to the linemen, the truck blew up, and one of them was struck by shrapnel. Other witnesses testified that Kehoe paused after stopping, calling Huyck over to the truck and that the two men struggled before Kehoe's truck was blown up.\n\nAlthough there was never any doubt that Kehoe was the perpetrator, the jury was asked to determine if the school board or its employees were guilty of criminal negligence. After more than a week of testimony, the jury exonerated the school board and its employees. In its verdict, the jury concluded that Kehoe \u201cconducted himself sanely and so concealed his operations that there was no cause to suspect any of his actions; and we further find that the school board, and Frank Smith, janitor of the school building, were not negligent in and about their duties, and were not guilty of any negligence in not discovering Kehoe's plan.\u201d\n\nThe inquest determined that Kehoe murdered Superintendent Emory Huyck on the morning of May 18. It was also the jury's verdict that the school was blown up as part of a plan and that Kehoe alone, without the aid of conspirators, murdered 43 people in total, including his wife Nellie. Suicide was determined to be the cause of Kehoe's death, which brought the total number of dead to 44 at the time of the inquest.\n\nOn August 22, three months after the bombing, fourth-grader Beatrice Gibbs died following hip surgery. Hers was the 45th and final death directly attributable to the Bath School disaster, which made it the deadliest attack ever to occur in an American school. Richard Fritz, whose older sister Marjorie Fritz was killed in the explosion, was injured in the explosion and died almost one year later of myocarditis at the age of eight. Although Richard is not included on many lists of the victims, his death from myocarditis is thought to have been directly caused by an infection resulting from his injuries.\n\n===Rebuilding===\nGovernor Green quickly called for donations to aid the townspeople and created the Bath Relief Fund with the money supplied by donors, the state, and local governments. People from around the country donated to the fund.\n\nSchool resumed on September5, 1927, and, for the 1927\u20131928 school year, was held in the community hall, township hall, and two retail buildings. Most of the surviving students returned. The board appointed O.\u00a0M. Brant of Luther, Michigan, to succeed Huyck as superintendent. The Lansing architect Warren Holmes donated construction plans, and the school board approved the contracts for the new building on September 14. On September 15, Michigan's US Senator James J. Couzens presented his personal check for $75,000 to the Bath construction fund to help build the new school.\n\nThe board demolished the damaged portion of the school and constructed a new wing with the donated funds. During the reconstruction dynamite was found in the building on three separate occasions. The James Couzens Agricultural School was dedicated on August18, 1928. The Kehoe farm was completely plowed to ensure that no explosives were hidden in the ground and was sold at auction to pay the mortgage.\n\n===Legacy===\nArtist Carleton W. Angell presented the board with a memorial statue in 1928 entitled Girl With a Cat (also known colloquially as Girl With a Kitten). The Bath School Museum in the school district's middle school contains many items connected with the disaster including the statue.\n\nIn 1975, the Couzens building was demolished and the site was redeveloped as the James Couzens Memorial Park, dedicated to the victims. At the center of the park is the Bath Consolidated School's original cupola, which survived the disaster and remained on the school until the building was torn down. After some debate, a Michigan State Historical Marker was installed at the park in 1991 by the Michigan Historical Commission. In 2002 a bronze plaque bearing the names of those killed in the disaster was placed on a large stone near the entrance of the park.\n\nThe town announced on November3, 2008, that tombstones had been donated for Emilie and Robert Bromundt, the last two bombing victims whose graves were still unmarked. A grant from a foundation paid for the grave markers. In September 2014, a gravestone was installed at the grave of Richard A. Fritz, whose death in 1928 was attributed to injuries sustained in the explosion. The gravestone was paid for by an author writing about the disaster for a book.\n\nA documentary on the disaster was released in 2011, including interviews with various survivors which had been taped starting in 2004. On May18, 2017, the disaster's 90th\u00a0anniversary was marked with a panel discussion at the Bath Middle School.\n\nMedical experts have seen this unique act of historic school terrorism as a way to \"to gain perspective on pediatric patterns of injury and future disaster preparedness\".\n\n\nFile:MichiganHistoricalSign.jpg|alt=State of Michigan Historical marker with gold text on a green background, standing in a field of snow|Michigan state historic site marker\nFile:Bath School Disaster Victims.jpeg|alt=bronze plaque listing the people's names who died during the disaster (with the exception of the Kehoes), fixed to a large boulder|Plaque at the entrance of James Couzens Memorial Park\nFile:Photograph of Cupola from Bath, Michigan Consolidated School.jpg|alt=Red-roofed white cupola from the 1927 building, surrounded by a small white picket fence|Cupola from the school building, displayed at James Couzens Memorial Park\n\n\n== See also ==\n* List of rampage killers (school massacres)\n* List of school-related attacks\n* List of attacks related to primary schools\n* List of attacks related to secondary schools\n\n\n==Notes==\n\n\n==References==\n\n\n==Further reading==\n* My Scrapbook on the Bath School Bombing of May 18th, 1927 with Many Never Before Published Photographs, Stories & Survivors' Quotes by Bath historian Gene H.

{"title":"1995 Rijeka bombing","article":"The 1995 Rijeka bombing occurred on 20 October 1995 in Rijeka, Croatia, when an Islamic terrorist organization attempted to destroy a police station by driving a car with a bomb into the wall of the building. Twenty-seven employees in the police station and two bystanders on the street were injured, although the only person killed was the attacker.\n\n== Cause ==\n\nIn the last days of the Bosnian War, the Croatian Defense Council (HVO), a Bosnian Croat military force, captured Talaat Fouad Qasim when he attempted to enter Bosnia and Herzegovina. Qasim, an important member of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, was soon transferred to Egypt with the active help of Croatia. Because of that and because Croatia had de facto controlled the Croatian Defence Council, the military organization which had captured Talaat Fouad Qasim, a decision was made to commit a terrorist attack in Croatia.\n\n== The attack ==\n\nAt 11:21\u00a0a.m. Central European Time, a Fiat 131 Mirafiori entered the parking lot of the Primorje-Gorski Kotar County police headquarters. Due to the 90-degree turn needed to enter the lot, the vehicle moved slowly. Near the entrance, the driver did not park in the parking spaces for civilians, but instead started to accelerate towards the wall at the end of the parking lot. Due to the low security measures, this incident was not noticed before the attack itself took place. After 15\u201320 meters, passing 8-10 available parking spaces in the small lot, the Fiat crashed into the stairs leading to the police station and exploded. The time of explosion was recorded as 11:22\u00a0a.m. local time (10:22\u00a0UTC). Subsequently, a police investigation found out the car was loaded with  of highly-explosive TNT. The police also found a part of a Canadian passport inside the remains of the attacker's car. The next day, representatives of the al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya terrorist organization from Egypt claimed responsibility for the attack, requesting extradition of Qasim.\n\nDue to an error made by the attackers, the bombing did not cause fatalities, aside from the suicide bomber himself. The police headquarters is located on a higher ground than the parking lot itself, requiring the stairs in the first place. The other apparent miscalculation involved the size of the parking lot, where the Fiat 131 had neither the space and velocity, nor the horsepower, to climb the stairs and destroy the police station wall. As a result, the police station failed to collapse and only 29 injuries were recorded (including two unaware bystanders). The bomb also carved a large crater in the ground, battering nearby buildings and destroying vehicles.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nWith the help of the CIA, officials examined the video footage of the attack. American and Croatian investigative sources came to the conclusion that Hassan al-Sharif Mahmud Saad had organized this attack. Saad had come to live in Bosnia only that year; previously, he had been living in Italy. Soon after the attack, Bosnian officials discovered that Saad was planning a new terrorist attack, against NATO forces, which was to happen in December 1995. A few days after that attack failed, he was killed in central Bosnia in a firefight with Croatian Defense Council forces.\n\n== See also ==\n*1993 Hidroelektra Workers Massacre\n\n== References ==\n\n\n\n== Other sources ==\n\n*Novi List (newspaper of Rijeka)","urls":["https:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9402E7DE1E39F931A15753C1A963958260","http:\/\/www.fhs.se\/upload\/Webbadmin\/Organisation\/CATS\/Kohlmann.doc","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20080809030842\/http:\/\/www.fhs.se\/upload\/Webbadmin\/Organisation\/CATS\/Kohlmann.doc","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/WORLD\/Newsbriefs\/9510\/10-21\/am.html?iref=newssearch","http:\/\/www.isn.ethz.ch\/Digital-Library\/Articles\/Detail\/?id=92320"]}
{"title":"Glasgow Airport attack","article":"The Glasgow Airport attack was a terrorist ramming attack which occurred on 30 June 2007, at 15:11 BST, when a dark green Jeep Cherokee loaded with propane canisters was driven at the glass doors of the Glasgow Airport terminal and set ablaze. It was the first terrorist attack to take place in Scotland since the Lockerbie bombing in 1988. The attack took place three days after the appointment of Scottish MP Gordon Brown as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but Downing Street dismissed suggestions of a connection. A close link was quickly established to the 2007 London car bombs the previous day. Although the doors were damaged, security bollards outside the entrance stopped the car from entering the terminal, where there were 4,000 people, with the potential for many fatalities.\n\nThe car's driver was severely burnt in the ensuing fire, and five members of the public were injured, none seriously. Some injuries were sustained by those assisting the police in detaining the occupants.\n\nBoth of the car's occupants were apprehended at the scene, and all those injured were taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in nearby Paisley. Within three days, Scotland Yard had confirmed that eight people had been taken into custody in connection with this incident and that in London.\n\nPolice identified the two men as Bilal Abdullah, a British-born, Muslim doctor of Iraqi descent working at the Royal Alexandra Hospital, and Kafeel Ahmed, also known as Khalid Ahmed, an engineer and the driver, who was treated for fatal burns at the same hospital. The newspaper The Australian alleged that a suicide note indicated that the two had intended to die in the attack. Kafeel Ahmed died from his injuries on 2 August. Bilal Abdullah was later found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 32 years.\n\n==Events==\n\nA dark green Jeep Cherokee, registration number L808 RDT, travelling at a speed estimated by a witness as about 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km\/h), struck security bollards in a terror ramming attack at the main entrance to Glasgow Airport. The vehicle was reported to have several petrol containers and propane gas canisters on board. One eyewitness said flames issued from beneath the car when it hit the building, while another eyewitness said it appeared the driver was trying to drive through the terminal doors. According to reports, the car was occupied by two \"Asian-looking\" men. When the Jeep failed to explode, one man (later identified as Abdulla) threw petrol bombs from the passenger seat and the other (Ahmed) doused himself in petrol and set it alight. Police indicated the vehicle burst into flames when it was driven at the terminal. An eyewitness noted that a man got out of the car and began to fight with police. Another eyewitness said that the man was throwing punches and repeatedly shouting \"Allah\". The man was arrested and later identified as Bilal Abdulla, a UK-born doctor of Iraqi descent who was working at the Royal Alexandra Hospital. Another man exited the car and ran into the terminal building while he was on fire and began writhing on the ground, before being confronted by an airport employee, John Smeaton, who was awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal for his heroism.\n\nDuring the subsequent investigation propane gas canisters were removed from the car. A Strathclyde Police spokesman confirmed the two men in the car were arrested, one of them badly burned. The man was initially taken to Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley before being transferred to the intensive care unit at Glasgow Royal Infirmary due to it having a specialist burns unit, where he died on 2 August. The Jeep was removed early on the morning of Sunday 1 July before flights resumed and the airport was partially reopened.\n\n=== Hospitals ===\nRoyal Alexandra Hospital's accident and emergency department was evacuated and then closed when a suspected explosive device on the bomber's body was found. Affected patients were taken to the Southern General Hospital and the Western Infirmary. It later emerged the device was not explosive. The second man, Bilal Abdullah, was initially held at nearby Govan police station, one of the UK's high security police stations with the capability to hold terrorist suspects. He was later transferred to Paddington Green Police Station in London, along with two unnamed suspects, after the Lord Advocate Elish Angiolini gave her consent to a combined prosecution in England under English law.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack the airport was evacuated and all flights suspended. Evacuated holiday-goers, including some who were left in aircraft for up to ten hours after the event, were accommodated overnight in the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre.  BAA indicated the airport main terminal re-opened for an incoming flight from Ibiza on 1 July 2007 at 07:37, and began handling departures from approximately 09:00.\n\n=== Number plate ===\nAutomatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology identified the vehicle of two suspects connected with the Glasgow Airport attack on the M6 motorway, between junctions 18 and 17, near Holmes Chapel, Cheshire. The police brought the vehicle to a slow halt. The suspects, medical doctor Mohammed Asha and his wife, were arrested.\n\n== London car bombs ==\n\n\nThe police said they believed the attack was linked to the 2007 London car bombs 36 hours before. The vehicle was reported to have contained 60 litres of petrol, gas cylinders, and nails. Scotland Yard reported that while the gas contained in the canisters and the quantity of the canisters remains unknown, further details would be given after they were analysed by forensic experts. The head of Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism command said, \"It is obvious that if the device had detonated there could have been serious injury or loss of life.\" The device could not have detonated, because it lacked an oxidiser, according to a columnist for The Register (UK). This information may have originated from an interview of former CIA counter-terrorism officer Larry Johnson, conducted by Keith Olbermann of MSNBC on 29 June.\n\nAccording to Sky News, the gas cylinders contained propane, used for patio heaters. A second bomb was later found in a blue Mercedes-Benz 280E believed to have been left in the same area at around the same time. The illegally parked car received a parking ticket in Cockspur Street at 02:30. At about 03:30 the car was transported to the Park Lane car pound. Staff left the car in a public area after smelling petrol fumes and alerted police on hearing about the first bomb.\n\nUS officials told NBC News that three men had been identified and were believed to be from Birmingham. The network reported that one of the three men could be an associate of Dhiren Barot, an Indian convert to Islam who was sentenced to life in prison in 2006 for plotting to fill limousines with explosives similar to those found in these incidents and park them in garages beneath hotels and office complexes. Bharot also planned to attack five financial landmarks in the United States: the New York Stock Exchange and the Citigroup Center in New York City; the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, both in Washington, D.C.; and the Prudential Building in Newark, New Jersey. Scotland Yard denied claims from a report by ABC News that police had a \"crystal clear\" picture of one suspect from CCTV footage.\n\nA 27-year-old doctor from India, Mohammed Haneef was arrested at Brisbane Airport in Australia on 2 July in connection with the bombings in the UK. He was arrested while trying to board a flight with a one-way ticket to Bangalore, India, apparently to visit his newly born daughter. The arrest followed information received from the UK. The case against him collapsed and Haneef was released .\n\n== Reporting ==\n\n=== 1 July ===\n\nOn the afternoon of 1 July, police carried out a controlled explosion on a car in the car park of the Royal Alexandra Hospital, where one suspect was being treated. The hospital was cordoned off for a time, and ambulances were redirected to other local hospitals. It is not clear if there was another device attached to the second car.\n\n=== 2 July ===\nPolice made two further arrests in Paisley in the early hours of 2 July in connection with the attack, bringing the total number of arrests to seven. At least two suspects are thought to be locum physicians reportedly working at the Royal Alexandra Hospital and at a Staffordshire hospital. These hospitals were the subject of police searches.\n\nOn 2 July 2007, an eighth person was detained in Australia in connection with both the Glasgow and London attacks. Australian news reports indicated that two people in Queensland were detained for questioning. Both were doctors; one, Mohammed Asif Ali, was released after questioning with no charges being brought. The other, Mohamed Haneef, 27, graduated from the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences in India in 2002 and entered Australia due to the shortage of doctors in regional hospitals. He was working as a registrar at a Gold Coast hospital and was detained at Brisbane Airport while trying to board a one-way flight to India via Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. His family claimed that Haneef's link to the alleged attackers was tenuous, he was not involved in the plot, and that he was returning to India to see his wife and ten-day-old daughter.\n\n==Arrests==\n# Bilal Abdullah, 27, born in England, and moved to Iraq as a child. Alleged attacker, arrested immediately at Glasgow Airport. Convicted of conspiracy to murder, and sentenced to life imprisonment\n# Kafeel Ahmed, aka Khalid Ahmed, born in India, studying for a PhD in engineering. Taken to hospital after the attack and treated for burns over 90% of his body surface. Died from his injuries, 2 August 2007.\n# Mohammed Asha, 26, from Jordan. Arrested on the M6 motorway. Later found not guilty of conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause explosions; he contested deportation and eventually returned to work.\n# Marwah Dana Asha, 27, from Jordan. Wife of Mohammed Asha and arrested with him on the M6 motorway, later released without charge.\n# Sabeel Ahmed, 26, born in India. Arrested in Liverpool. A doctor who works at Halton Hospital in Cheshire. Brother of Kafeel Ahmed.\n# Mohamed Haneef, 27, from India. Detained at Brisbane Airport, Australia and later charged with recklessly supporting a terrorist organisation, charges which have now been dropped. Currently appealing cancellation of his work visa by the Australian government. Second cousin of Kafeel and Sabeel Ahmed.\n# Unnamed 28-year-old Saudi man, arrested in Houston, Renfrewshire. Reported to be a medical student working at Royal Alexandra Hospital. Released without charge.\n# Unnamed 25-year-old Saudi man, arrested in Houston along with unnamed 28-year-old. Also reported to be a medical student at the RAH. Released without charge.\n\n===Medical links===\nThe BBC reported that eight people were being questioned, most of whom had worked for the NHS and five of whom were doctors.\n\n== Perpetrators ==\n\n=== Bilal Abdullah ===\n\nAbdullah, along with Ahmed, is believed to have been responsible for leaving car bombs in London two days prior to the Glasgow Airport attack. Abdullah was the owner of the Jeep and was charged with conspiracy to cause explosions. He was remanded in custody awaiting trial, and was ultimately given two concurrent life sentences, of which he would be required to serve at least 32 years in prison.\n\nWhile Ahmed was on fire inside the car, Abdullah reportedly attacked Sergeant Torquil Campbell at the scene, in an attempt to prevent him from approaching the burning vehicle, running to the rear of the vehicle to try to open the back hatch. During the scuffle, police officer Stewart Ferguson was spraying the burning man with a fire extinguisher. Popping and banging could be heard coming from the vehicle. A suicide note left behind indicates that the men intended to die in the attack.\n\nA resident of Neuk Crescent, Houston, outside Glasgow, Bilal Abdullah was born on 17 September 1980 in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, where his father, a medical doctor, was working. He qualified in medicine in Baghdad in 2004, and first registered as a doctor in the UK in 2006. He was given limited registration by the General Medical Council (GMC) from 5 August 2006 to 11 August 2007. He worked at the Royal Alexandra Hospital, Ward 10, in Paisley as a locum house-officer in the diabetes department, dealing with outpatients at a drop-in clinic and obstetric clinics. He had links to the Sunni Wahabist sect of Islam and radical Islamic groups, and had been disciplined for spending too much time on the internet at the Royal Alexandra Hospital. He is also said to have come to the notice of the security service, after visiting Islamist websites.\n\nA silver Vauxhall Astra, which was subject to a controlled explosion by police on 3 July 2007, was believed to have been rented by Dr Abdullah.\n\nDuring his testimony at his trial, Bilal said his motivation  was retaliation for the destruction of Iraq, first through sanctions that included even medicine, the rise of childhood leukaemia there, which he blamed on depleted uranium armour-piercing shells used in the 1991 Gulf War, and for destruction of infrastructure during the US and British 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nKafeel Ahmed and Bilal Abdullah were also behind the 2007 London car bombs plot, and investigations were being carried out to unearth a possible involvement with the deadly 2005 Indian Institute of Science shooting, an attack by unknown suspects still at large.\n\nAbdullah had been given limited registration by the General Medical Council (GMC) from 5 August 2006 to 11 August 2007. The GMC's interim orders panel made a determination, subsequent to the Glasgow Airport attacks, that Abdullah's registration should be suspended as an interim measure; it was suspended until its expiry.\n\nOn 17 December 2009 he was convicted at Woolwich Crown Court of conspiracy to murder for the incidents in both London and Glasgow, and sentenced to life imprisonment with a requirement that he spend at least 32 years in jail.\n\n=== Kafeel Ahmed ===\n\nAhmed was often mistakenly referred to as a medical doctor. He was arrested in Great Britain in the aftermath of the 2007 Glasgow Airport attack. He was held hospitalised at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary in a critical condition, after he suffered severe burns in the attack. He had suffered burns to 90% of his body, and was not expected to survive\u2014he had already been revived twice as of 4 July. A suicide note left behind indicates that the passengers of the vehicle, Ahmed and Bilal Abdullah, intended to die in the attack. Kafeel was the brother of Sabeel Ahmed, also arrested in the aftermath of the attack.\n\nMobile phone records have shown that, during his 2005\u20132007 stay in India, Ahmed had frequent communications with Malta, the United Kingdom, Finland, Saudi Arabia and Oman. In May 2007, prior to departing to Britain from his native Bangalore, he entrusted to his mother a compact disc that he said contained some important information on his \"project\". The disk has been handed over to police for analysis. The disk contained speeches by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, propaganda against the United States and Britain, and some literature on jihad and the plight of Muslims in Iraq, Afghanistan and Chechnya. Ahmed followed campaigns in Iraq, Afghanistan and Palestine, and frequented Islamist chat rooms on the Internet. Digital material found included graphic depictions of real-life occurrences of torture in Chechnya, hundreds of bomb designs from the Internet, and evidence that he used the Bangalore-based political platform Discover Islam for the purposes of recruitment.\n\nAccording to police sources, Ahmed was an engineer pursuing a PhD in computational fluid dynamics at Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, in the UK, on the topic of \"Computational Approach to Ink-jet Printing of Tactile Maps.\" He would have earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from India, and an MPhil degree in aeronautical engineering from Queen's University Belfast. He might have been in the UK as early as September 2003. He is believed to have organised a Chechnya Day Meeting in his native city of Bangalore in February 2006. He was a member of the Tablighi Jamaat missionary sect.\n\nAs an aeronautics engineer, Ahmed was able to secure employment, from December 2005, to August 2006, with Infotech, an Indian outsourcing company servicing clients such as Airbus and Boeing, before resigning abruptly. He may have had access to sensitive design information about various aviation companies.\n\nKafeel Ahmed and Bilal Abdullah were behind the 2007 London car bombs plot, and investigations are being carried out to unearth a possible involvement with the deadly 2005 Indian Institute of Science shooting, an attack by unknown suspects still at large.\n\nPrior to his attacks in London and Glasgow, he had visited numerous Islamist websites, including that of the Jamaat al Dawa, the parent organisation of Islamic terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Toiba. On 2 August 2007, Strathclyde Police reported that Ahmed had died in the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. His last rituals were held in the UK.\n\n== Other notable people ==\n\n\n===John Smeaton===\nSmeaton, a bag handler, was off duty when he saw the incident start to develop. He heard three explosions as he smoked a cigarette during his break. He ran over to help the police. Smeaton confronted and groin-kicked Kafeel Ahmed, who later died from 90% burns following the attack. During the incident Smeaton also helped drag Michael Kerr to safety after Kerr had been left lying with a broken leg beside the burning jeep after kicking Ahmed.\n\nThe incident has been described as inspiring others to take personal initiative and act decisively in a crisis. Newsagent and former policeman Mohammed Afzah cited Smeaton as inspiration for his facing down and repelling a would-be armed robber. In late July, Smeaton returned to his old job as a baggage handler at the airport. Later in the year he accepted a job as head of security at a nearby company.\n\nSmeaton was awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal; this was presented by The Queen at a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 4 March 2008.\n\nIn July 2010 it was announced that seven others would be awarded the Queen's Commendation for Bravery for their parts in combating the threat.\n\n==Reactions==\n===Scotland===\n\n\nScottish First Minister, Alex Salmond, along with the Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Kenny MacAskill and the Lord Advocate Elish Angiolini participated in the COBRA meeting chaired by Gordon Brown. Salmond stated that \"The incident at Glasgow Airport today as well as recent events in London show that we face threats both north and south of the border\u2014and both the Scottish and UK Governments are united in our determination to stand up to that threat to protect our communities\".\n\nKenny MacAskill, the Cabinet Secretary for Justice, insisted that the recent terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport was not committed by 'home-grown' terrorists.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n\nThe Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, was kept briefed on developments by officials. He chaired a meeting of COBRA, the government's emergency committee, on the evening of the Glasgow incident to deal with both it and the two London car bombs of the day before. He also spoke to the First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond regarding the incident. Brown further addressed the issues by telling the media, \"I know that the British people will stand together\". He thanked emergency services and urged the public to remain vigilant.\n\n====Home Office response====\nAt 20:15, the Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, announced that the incident was being treated as a terrorist attack and that the United Kingdom terrorism threat level had been elevated from \"Severe\" to \"Critical\", meaning \"further attacks are expected imminently\".\n\nOn the night of the attack, Scottish television station STV was meant to broadcast a one-off programme on the soon-to-be-released movie (at the time of the incident), Die Hard 4.0, however due to the nature of the film, the decision was taken to replace the programme. National TV channel ITV changed its schedule on the night of Monday 2 July following the attack: it was to show the film Die Hard 2 (which is about terrorists attacking an airport) as the Monday evening film, but replaced it with Cliffhanger.\n\nOn 4 July, the national status was lowered from \"Critical\" back to \"Severe\".\n\n===International reactions===\n* United States Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff stated that \"We have been in close contact with our counterparts in the U.K. regarding today's incident at the Glasgow airport and yesterday's car bomb discoveries in London. Our law enforcement and intelligence officials are closely monitoring the ongoing investigations. The senior leadership of the U.S. government has been meeting on these issues both yesterday and today. DHS and the FBI have provided updates and protective measures guidance to our state and local homeland security and law enforcement partners\".\n* Gordon Johndroe, a spokesperson for the United States National Security Council, told reporters that the National Security Council is \"in contact with British authorities on the matter.\"\n* Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon has condemned the attack and vows to fight for an end to global terrorism.\n\n===Security responses===\nAccording to the Metropolitan Police extra officers were deployed at landmarks, airports, railway stations and bus terminals across the country on Sunday with orders to increase the use of stop and search powers, while armed police were patrolling major rail stations. They also said that there would be at least 450 officers monitoring a Concert for Diana at Wembley Stadium on Sunday, 1 July in memory of Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nIn response to both the attack on Glasgow Airport and the attempted attacks on London, security around the ongoing Wimbledon tennis championships in south-west London was increased, with the use of concrete car blockers. Security measures were also increased at the T in the Park music festival in Balado, Kinross, which took place the weekend after the attack on Glasgow Airport.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nAt approximately 08:00 on 1 July 2007, the police stated that a phased reopening would begin, allowing the airport to return to normal. The first flight after the incident was due to leave at approximately 09:00. Strathclyde Police searched a number of houses in nearby Houston. At 15:10 (23 hours 59\u00a0minutes after the attack), the main terminal building (Terminal 1) re-opened. The inner lanes immediately in front of the terminal building remain off limits to all vehicles, and only authorised public transport vehicles are being allowed to use the outer lanes.\n\nPolice in Liverpool arrested one man in connection with the events in Glasgow and London, and two people were arrested by police on the M6 near Sandbach in Cheshire. Two Liverpool addresses were searched, in the Mossley Hill and Toxteth areas.\n\nMohammad Sarwar, MP for the nearby constituency of Glasgow Central, reported that threats had been made against the Muslim community in Scotland following the incident.\n\nOn October 24 2008 an interview with Abu Hamza al-Muhajir, the Minister of War for the so-called Islamic State of Iraq was released by the Al-Furqan Institute for Media Production. The audio runs for a total of 44 minutes. At one point he said his group carried out its \"last operation in Britain, a good part of which was launched on the (Glasgow June 2007) airport and the rest was not carried out due to a mistake made by one of the brothers.\". There is support for this claim as just before the two men set off from Loch Lomond to Glasgow airport Kafeel Ahmed sent a text message to his brother Sabeel in Liverpool telling him to go to an email account. Secondly Bilal Abdulla (the other bomber) addressed his will to Abu Omar al-Baghdadi and Abu Hamza al-Muhajir, \u201cMinister of War,\u201d who were the leader and deputy leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq   There were reports that al-Muhajir personally recruited people for the plot between 2004 and 2005 \n\n===Other airports===\n\nEdinburgh, Aberdeen, Cardiff, Belfast, Birmingham, Manchester and Newcastle's airports all took measures to prevent similar action by blocking off roads approaching and in front of the terminal buildings, with the terminals and blockades policed by local police forces.\n\n\nLondon Luton Airport moved the taxi ranks away from the main terminal building. Blackpool International Airport was shut down temporarily. Glasgow Prestwick, the city's second airport, was kept open with armed police on site. London Heathrow Airport advised people not to bring private cars near the passenger terminals for security reasons.\n\nOn the evening of 30 June, Liverpool John Lennon Airport was closed for eight hours while a vehicle was removed and taken away for forensic testing, reopening at about 04:40 on Sunday morning.\n\nPearson International Airport, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada increased security measures in response to the attack.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Tony Snow said that airport security in the United States would be tightened, but that the airport terror alert level would remain at its current status, \"Orange\" (also called \"High\"), where it has been since late 2006. An additional issued statement from the Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff stated, \"...\u00a0at this point, I have seen no specific, credible information suggesting that this latest incident is connected to a threat to the \"\n\nAn article on the website of ABC News alleged that United States law enforcement officials were informed two weeks prior to the Glasgow incident of possible attacks on \"airport infrastructure or aircraft\" in Scotland and the Czech Republic, leading to the placement of Federal Air Marshals on flights into and out of Glasgow and Prague.\n\nOn 1 July, the American Airlines terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York was evacuated due to a suspicious package left on the kerb.\n\n===Appeals for information===\nOn 1 July the police asked to hear from anyone with information about the dark green Jeep Cherokee, registration number L808 RDT, and also asked for any amateur footage or photos taken of the vehicle on fire.\n\n===Public reaction===\nThis attack, and the earlier attempt in London, were both notable as high-profile, yet substantially unsuccessful. The public reaction\u2014particularly in the blogosphere\u2014was amusement as much as fear.\n\nThe baggage handler John Smeaton became a minor celebrity following his actions in curbing the attack and the news interviews he gave, and was awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal.\n\n==Trial==\n\nThe trial of Bilal Abdullah, arrested at the scene of the attack concluded in December 2008. During the trial more details emerged of the connection between the Glasgow attacks and the attempted car-bombing of London's West End just a few days earlier. Abdullah and Kafeel Ahmed were linked to both attacks. E-mail and mobile phone conversations indicated the men first contacted each other in February 2007. Receipts and CCTV images discovered by police showed Kafeel Ahmed bought components for an improvised bomb, including nails, from hardware store B&Q. The pair were also believed to have carried out reconnaissance in London. On 28 June 2007 Ahmed and Abdullah left Scotland in the two-second-hand Mercedes vehicles and were recorded on CCTV driving to London and parking both vehicles in locations in the West End. After the bombs failed to detonate the men stayed at the Newham Hotel, Romford Road, before leaving London by train via Stansted. They were then captured again on CCTV at Johnstone railway station, near Glasgow. Returning to the \"bomb factory\" in Glasgow they modified the Jeep into an improvised bomb.\n\nAfter filling the Jeep with explosive material, Abdullah and Ahmed left early the following morning, driving around the Loch Lomond area for several hours before attempting their failed attack on Glasgow Airport. A The New York Times report on the trial refers to: 'But evidence at the trial showed that the two vehicles had failed to explode despite repeated signals from the mobile phones because of faulty assembly of the so-called fuel air bombs involved. Prosecutors said that a laptop owned by Dr. Abdulla\u2014found in the Jeep that crashed into the air terminal\u2014showed that the two men had studied blueprints for the bombs that they had found on Islamic extremists' Web sites. In lengthy testimony, Dr. Abdulla said he had intended only to give people in Britain \"a taste of fear\" and a \"scare\" with the bombings, not to kill people. But the chief prosecutor, Jonathan Laidlaw, said the timing of the attacks, at the height of Friday night crowds in central London, and on Glasgow airport's busiest day of the year, showed that the attackers had aimed at \"committing murder on an indiscriminate and wholesale scale.\" Following the trial verdict, Abdullah was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 32 years as a result of his involvement in both incidents.\n\n==See also==\n* 2007 UK terrorist incidents\n* Kafeel Ahmed aka Khalid Ahmed\n* Sabeel Ahmed\n* Mohamed Haneef\n* Islamic

{"title":"2002 Grozny truck bombing","article":"The Grozny truck bombing occurred on December 27, 2002, when three Chechen suicide bombers ran vehicles into the heavily guarded republic's government headquarters in the regional capital Grozny.\n\n== Details ==\nThe drivers of two vehicles reportedly wore federal military uniforms and carried official passes which allowed them through three successive military checkpoints on their way to the headquarters building. A guard at the fourth and final checkpoint attempted to inspect the vehicles, and began firing on the vehicles as they drove through the checkpoint towards the building.\n\nThe explosion by the equivalent of a ton of dynamite brought down the roof and floors of the four-story building. The first reports said of as few as two dead. Ultimately, Chechen officials said 83 people were killed (48 on the spot) and 210 were injured. Several Chechen administration officials were injured in the attack, including Deputy Prime Minister Zina Batyzheva (seriously wounded) and Chechen Security Council Secretary Rudnik Dudayev. The head of the pro-Russian administration in Chechnya, Akhmad Kadyrov, and his Prime Minister, Mikhail Babich, were not in the building at the time.\n\n== Responsibility ==\n\nColonel Ilya Shabalkin, spokesman for the joint federal forces in Chechnya, said the bombing was organized by Chechen rebel field commanders Abu al-Walid and Shamil Basayev. Basayev claimed responsibility for the planning and execution of the attack, saying that he personally detonated the bomb by remote control.\n\nSome news reports called the attack an act of terrorism, which with 83 confirmed fatalities, would have been the deadliest terrorist attack in Chechnya. Others described the attackers as militants and rebels and not terrorists.\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n* Chechen rebels punch ever harder, BBC News, 27 December 2002\n* Chechnya suicide bombers 'used Russian military links', The Guardian, December 29, 2002","urls":["http:\/\/www.globalsecurity.org\/military\/library\/news\/2003\/06\/mil-030620-voa05.htm","http:\/\/www.stratfor.com\/memberships\/101273]","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110722174514\/http:\/\/www.stratfor.com\/memberships\/101273","http:\/\/www.hrvc.net\/news\/7c-1-2003.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110927112742\/http:\/\/www.hrvc.net\/news\/7c-1-2003.html","https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/main.jhtml;jsessionid=RVMIVTR5FJORNQFIQMGSFFWAVCBQWIV0?xml=\/news\/2002\/12\/28\/wchech28.xml","http:\/\/www.rferl.org\/reports\/securitywatch\/2003\/01\/1-070103.asp","https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/main.jhtml?xml=\/news\/2006\/07\/11\/db1101.xml","http:\/\/www.ambafrance-uk.org\/Terrorist-attack-on-the-local.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20130518020504\/http:\/\/www.ambafrance-uk.org\/Terrorist-attack-on-the-local.html","http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2004\/WORLD\/europe\/02\/06\/russia.timeline\/index.html","https:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9D07EED61F3CF93BA15751C1A9649C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/europe\/3019493.stm"]}
{"title":"2009 Nazran bombing","article":"The 2009 Nazran bombing occurred on 17 August 2009, in Nazran, the largest city of the Republic of Ingushetia in the Russian federation. A suicide car bomber attacked police headquarters, and at least 25 people were killed and 164 injured. It was the most serious terrorist attack in Ingushetia in the early 21st century, where there had been social and political unrest related to independence movements. The militant Islamist Caucasus Emirate claimed responsibility for the attack. \n\n==Background==\n\n\n== Attack ==\nAt 9:08\u00a0a.m.(MSK) on 17 August 2009, an unidentified militant drove a GAZelle truck into the gates of a police headquarters building in Nazran, Ingushetia's largest city. The attack occurred as police officers were lining up nearby for a morning briefing. Policemen fired at the car, but were unable to stop it. The blast, which reportedly had the force of 400\u00a0kg of dynamite, created a crater  wide and  deep, damaged the police headquarters building and nearby apartments. It also caused ammunition stored in the police headquarters to explode. Twenty people were reported to have been killed and 138 were injured. The toll later rose to 25 killed and 164 wounded, with 15 of the dead being Russian policemen and 10 being Ingush.\n\nAccording to the Republic's Deputy Interior Minister Zyaudin Dourbekov, police had received information on August 15 that a vehicle of this type was going to be used in a suicide bombing, but were unable to prevent the attack.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Ingush authorities announced a three-day mourning period. They promised to pay 100,000 rubles ($3,000 USD) and 50,000 rubles ($1,500 USD) in compensation to the families of those killed or injured. Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations dispatched a plane to Ingushetia carrying medical specialists and aid for the victims. Following the attack, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev sacked Ingush Interior Minister Ruslan Meiriyev, saying that the attack could have been prevented. \"This is the outcome not only of the problems related to terrorist attacks, but also of the republic law enforcement agencies' unsatisfactory work,\" Medvedev said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel offered condolences to those affected by the attack.\n\nAccording to Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for the Prosecutor General's Office, the most likely motives for the bombings are revenge for the work carried out by the police against militants or an attempt to destabilize the situation in the region. On 18 August Alexander Bastrykin said that the Federal Security Service (FSB) has received information about the organizers of the attack. He refused to name the suspects at this stage, but said that they belonged to the same groups that had conducted similar attacks in recent years. Bastrykhin assured that the FSB was doing everything it can to solve the crime.\n\nPresident Medvedev put Deputy Interior Minister of Russia, Colonel-General Arkady Yedelev in charge of all security and police operations in Ingushetia. The pro-administration President of Ingushetia, Yunus-bek Yevkurov, who had survived an assassination attempt in June 2009, said the rebels' goal was to \"destabilise the situation and spread panic\" in Ingushetia and claimed that the West had a hand in the escalation in the North Caucasus with the aim to prevent Russia from reviving \"its former Soviet might\".\n\nOn 19 August, President Dmitry Medvedev said that the continuing attacks against Ingush leadership, law enforcement officials and civilians must be dealt with severe punishment. He said that although external factors such as foreign funding for Islamist terrorists are also a concern, for the most part North Caucasus' security problems are the results of internal reasons such as corruption and socio-economic problems. \"The roots are in the structure  of  our  life, in unemployment, clans who could not care less about people and whose only concern is to how to divide the money poured in here,  to get a contract and to settle scores with one another later, as well as corruption, which has really become very widespread among law enforcement authorities.\"\n\nOn 21 August, the militant Islamist Caucasus Emirate group claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 2009, the violence grew in the North Caucasian republics of Russia and terrorist attacks became more frequent. Although Chechen separatist activity was confirmed to be diminished due to the heavy-handed security measures undertaken by Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, violence in Chechnya has been replaced by Islamic insurgency in the neighbouring republics, Dagestan and Ingushetia.\n\nAfter the June attempt on President Yevkurov's life, there had been several incidents just days before the Nazran attack on 17 August. Several other leading Ingush officials have been assassinated since June 2009, including Deputy Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Aza Gazgireeva, former Deputy Prime Minister Bashir Aushev, the head of the Forensics and Investigations Center Magomed Gadaborshev, and Construction Minister Ruslan Amerkhanov.\n\n== See also ==\n*2004 Nazran raid\n*List of terrorist incidents, 2009\n*Civil war in Ingushetia\n*North Caucasus Insurgency 2009\n*August curse\n\n== References ==","urls":["http:\/\/www.themoscowtimes.com\/article\/1010\/42\/380987.htm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20090822192415\/http:\/\/www.themoscowtimes.com\/article\/1010\/42\/380987.htm","http:\/\/www.themoscowtimes.com\/article\/600\/42\/380906.htm","http:\/\/en.rian.ru\/russia\/20090818\/155848718.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/08\/18\/world\/europe\/18russia.html?_r=1&hp","http:\/\/en.rian.ru\/russia\/20090817\/155834592.html","http:\/\/www.itar-tass.com\/eng\/level2.html?NewsID=14250545&PageNum=0","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20090822160806\/http:\/\/www.itar-tass.com\/eng\/level2.html?NewsID=14250545&PageNum=0","https:\/\/www.webcitation.org\/5jcEhnGCG?url=http:\/\/www.itar-tass.com\/eng\/level2.html?NewsID%3D14250545%26PageNum%3D0","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20090823183705\/http:\/\/georgiandaily.com\/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=14140&Itemid=132","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/europe\/8204670.stm","http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/news\/nationworld\/world\/la-fg-ingushetia-bomb18-2009aug18,0,5539599.story","http:\/\/en.rian.ru\/world\/20090817\/155836548.html","http:\/\/www.russiatoday.com\/Top_News\/2009-08-17\/blast-russia-nazran-ingushetia.html?fullstory","https:\/\/archive.is\/20130201171241\/http:\/\/www.russiatoday.com\/Top_News\/2009-08-17\/blast-russia-nazran-ingushetia.html?fullstory","http:\/\/en.rian.ru\/russia\/20090819\/155857223.html","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/latestCrisis\/idUSLI278471","http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/f3a9fdde-8b8d-11de-9f50-00144feabdc0.html","http:\/\/www.interfax.com\/3\/511984\/news.aspx","https:\/\/www.webcitation.org\/5j944cagC?url=http:\/\/www.interfax.com\/3\/511984\/news.aspx","http:\/\/en.rian.ru\/russia\/20090822\/155887435.html","http:\/\/www.jamestown.org\/single\/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=35507&no_cache=1","http:\/\/www.alertnet.org\/thenews\/newsdesk\/HRW\/acb93ad76de9628c932576501538c803.htm","http:\/\/www.russiaprofile.org\/page.php?pageid=Politics&articleid=a1250530347","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20090822190953\/http:\/\/www.russiaprofile.org\/page.php?pageid=Politics&articleid=a1250530347"]}

{"title":"1998 Temple of the Tooth attack","article":"1998 Temple of the Tooth attack is an attack on the Temple of the Tooth Relic, located in Kandy, Sri Lanka. The shrine, which is considered to be important to the Buddhists in Sri Lanka, houses the relic of the tooth of the Buddha, and is also a UNESCO designated World Heritage Site. In 1998, it was attacked by Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist militant organization which fought to create an independent Tamil state in Northern and Eastern parts of the country, from 1983 to 2009.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the latter part of the 1990s, Sri Lanka was at the height of a civil war. In 1995, Sri Lankan armed forces captured the Jaffna Peninsula at the country's Northern periphery, which was occupied by the LTTE for years. In 1996, the LTTE retaliated by taking the town of Mullaitivu, and inflicting heavy casualties to the government forces. The government launched the Operation Jayasikurui, and captured several LTTE held areas in 1997. Amid fighting, the LTTE carried out a number of suicide attacks on military, economic and civilian targets within the government held areas.\n\nIn early 1998, Sri Lanka was ready to celebrate its 50th independence anniversary from Great Britain. Charles, Prince of Wales and a number of foreign dignitaries were scheduled to arrive in the following days. Kandy city, in the central highlands of Sri Lanka, was selected as the host for independence day activity on 4 February. Meanwhile, on 28 January, Jaffna city was going to hold its local government election, after a break of 16 years due to the conflict. Despite heavy clashes in Kilinochchi and surrounding areas, Sri Lankan government was eager to demonstrate that a normal life has returned to its people.\n\n==Incident==\nOn 25 January 1998, the LTTE exploded a massive truck bomb inside the Temple of the Tooth premises, which was to be the centre the independence day celebrations. Three suicide LTTE Black Tigers drove an explosive laden truck along the King's street (Raja Veediya), firing at soldiers manning road blocks around the place, crashed through the entrance and detonated the bomb around 6:10\u00a0am, local time. Two explosions were heard. The truck contained 300\u2013400\u00a0kg of high explosives. 16 people, including the 3 attackers and a 2-year old infant were killed in the incident. Over 25 people, including 4 women, a monk and a police officer were injured. P. W. Withanage, a professor of geology also died due to shock after hearing the incident. The powerful attack left most of the buildings within a radius of 5\u00a0km damaged, and glass panes broken.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe bombing sparked a backlash among the public. Crowds gathered around the temple, and set fire to 3 vehicles and burned down a Hindu cultural center in Kandy. Police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. In the end, no one was harmed and the violence did not spread. Community leaders, including the then Sri Lankan president Chandrika Kumaratunga urged the Sinhalese community not to retaliate against the Tamil community, which the LTTE claimed to represent.\n\nNext day, the Sri Lankan government officially banned LTTE for the first time, as a direct result of this attack. It had not been banned previously as the government claimed that it wanted to bring the LTTE to the democratic path. This ban formally ended public advocacy for negotiations by the Kumaratunga government. The then Sri Lanka's minister of defence Anuruddha Ratwatte handed over his resignation, taking responsibility for the security lapse which led to the bomb blast. Despite the violence, local government elections were held in Jaffna, and a high voter turnout was observed. Independence day celebrations were shifted to Colombo; but the foreign dignitaries including Prince Charles arrived in the capital. Coincidentally, Madras High Court issued execution warrants to the LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and 25 others on 28 January, in connection to the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi.\n\n\nIn October 2003, three LTTE cadres involved in the attack were convicted by the Kandy high court and sentenced to death. Two others were sentenced to 680 years of rigorous imprisonment and third to 490 years. According to the Mackenzie Institute, part of the LTTE's incentive for the attack was to spark widespread mob violence against the country's Tamil minority, by the Sinhalese majority, as it was in 1983. But it did not happen after this incident.\n\n==Reaction==\nThe attack was condemned by various local and international organizations and individuals.\n\n===Local===\nVen. Rambukwelle Sri Vipassi, the then mahanayake thero of the Malwatte chapter and Ven. Palipane Sri Chandananda, the then mahanayake thero of the Asgiriya chapter, the chief custodians of the relic of the tooth of the Buddha expressed their deep shock of the attack. Vipassi thero stated, \"It is with immense pain of mind that I express my shock and profound sorrow on the extensive damage caused by terrorists to the sacred Sri Dalada Maligawa [Temple of the Tooth], which is held in deep veneration by the entirely of the Buddhist world.\"\n\nPresident of the Hindu Council of Sri Lanka, Yogendra Duraiswamy stated that the Hindu Council is \"deeply concerned at the cowardly attack perpetrated on the Dalada Maligawa, the holiest temple of the Buddhists in Sri Lanka.\" The then Archbishop of Colombo, Nicholas Marcus Fernando stated that no one in their normal senses would have thought of perpetrating such a crime which is not only against the Buddhists but against every citizen of the country. The Sri Lanka Islamic Centre (SLIC) and the International Buddhist Foundation also condemned the attack. Leader of the opposition in Sri Lanka parliament Ranil Wickremasinghe said, \"Not even in the darkest moments of Sri Lanka's 2,000-year history has such an act of destruction been perpetrated against the very symbol of our civilisation and history.\"\n\n===International===\nAmnesty International \u2013 Amnesty International issued a statement condemning the killing of civilians at the Temple of the Tooth bombing. It called on the LTTE to abide by basic principles of international humanitarian law, especially the common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and the Protocol II.\n\n \u2013 HRH Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, addressing the 50th independence anniversary celebrations in Colombo on 4 February stated, \"A proud consciousness of this richness of heritage must have made your pain all the more acute when a bomb was exploded at the Temple of the Tooth last month. It was a brutal and malign act, and one which we all join in condemning. The Temple of the Tooth is a part of the world's heritage; it is not just Sri Lankan nor just Buddhist. So all your foreign guests wish you well in the long and painstaking task of restoring the Temple to its original splendour.\"\n\nUNESCO \u2013 The then UNESCO Director General Federico Mayor Zaragoza, on 27 January stated, \"I am deeply shocked by this act of blind violence perpetrated against a place of meditation, joy and peace. All religions are based on love and respect for life. Attacking a holy place means striking the very best in humanity, undermining its innocence and purity. Those who attack people through their faith can only be condemned. Religious differences can absolutely not be justification for conflict, and places of worship should in no case be used as targets.\"\n\n \u2013 The office of the then United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan stated \"The Secretary General UN has learnt with outrage of the news of a bomb attack on a major Buddhist shrine in Kandy, Sri Lanka and the resulting loss of life and destruction. As he has done on many occasions, the Secretary General strongly condemns the use of terror tactics in all circumstances. He deplores attempts to divide human beings on religious and ethnic grounds.\"\n\n \u2013 The then United States ambassador to Sri Lanka, Shaun Donnelley condemned the attack saying that \"the entire world leadership had condemned the bomb blast on the sacred place. We should condemn this type of destruction of ancient places of religious and archaeological value.\"\n\n==Damage and restoration==\n\nThe attack caused severe damage to the temple; especially to its roof and the facade. But neither its inner chambers nor the tooth relic were harmed. Damaged parts of the temple include: Paththirippuwa (the octagon), Mahawahalkada (the grand entrance), the royal palace, sandakada pahana (the moonstone) at the entrance, the queen's bath, the library of the temple and some important sculptures in its exterior. Nearby Queen's Hotel, Natha devale and St. Paul's Church were also damaged.\n\nAfter clearing debris, the temple was opened for the public on 10 February. But complete restoration took more than one and a half years to complete. A presidential task force, headed by President Kumaratunga, and a Temple of the Tooth restoration committee, headed by the then Sri Lankan minister of cultural affairs Lakshman Jayakody, were formed to oversee the work. Department of Archaeology, Central Cultural Fund, State Engineering Corporation, Buildings Department, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Water and Drainage Board and Ceylon Electricity Board were involved in restoration and conservation efforts.\n\nThe badly damaged roofs were redone within 2 to 4 months, as a priority concern. Government initially granted 2 million Sri Lankan rupees for the restoration, following the attack. Public donations to the cause exceeded 100 million rupees, which was three times higher than the estimated cost. A number of local craftsmen and stone carvers were employed. This helped revival of the near-extinct profession of stone carving in Sri Lanka, which was confined to a few rural families at that time. In the end, all damaged sculptures were made new, and damaged paintings on lime plaster were reassembled and reintegrated with the existing pieces. The damage to the inner chambers revealed previously unknown paintings belonging to the Kirti Sri Rajasinha era. The restoration process was completed by August 1999.\n\n==See also==\n*1989 Temple of the Tooth attack\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n* Kandy bombing: mindless carnage or military strategy? a Tamil Guardian analysis\n* 'LTTE bomb killed mother on my visit to Dalada Maligawa' several eyewitness accounts of the attack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo restored stone carvings at the entrance of the temple: elephant carving (left) and the moonstone (right).

{"title":"AMIA bombing","article":"The AMIA bombing was a suicide van bomb attack on the Asociaci\u00f3n Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA; Argentine Israelite Mutual Association) building in Buenos Aires, Argentina on 18 July 1994, killing 85 people and injuring hundreds. The bombing is Argentina's deadliest terrorist attack to date. Argentina is home to a Jewish community of 230,000, the largest in Latin America and sixth in the world outside Israel (see Demographics of Argentina).\n\nOver the years, the case has been marked by accusations of cover-ups. All suspects in the \"local connection\" (among them, many members of the Buenos Aires Provincial Police) were found to be not guilty in September 2004. In August 2005, federal judge Juan Jos\u00e9 Galeano, in charge of the case, was impeached and removed from his post on a charge of \"serious\" irregularities due to mishandling of the investigation. In 2005, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, who would later become Pope Francis, was the first public personality to sign a petition for justice in the AMIA bombing case. He was one of the signatories on a document called \"85 victims, 85 signatures\" as part of the bombing's 11th anniversary.\n\nOn 25 October 2006, Argentine prosecutors Alberto Nisman and Marcelo Mart\u00ednez Burgos formally accused the government of Iran of directing the bombing, and the Hezbollah militia of carrying it out.\nAccording to the prosecution's claims in 2006, Argentina had been targeted by Iran after Buenos Aires' decision to suspend a nuclear technology transfer contract to Tehran. This has been disputed because the contract was never terminated and Iran and Argentina were negotiating on restoration of full cooperation on all agreements from early 1992 until 1994, when the bombing occurred.\n\nIn 2015 Alberto Nisman filed a 300-page document accusing former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of covering up Iran's role in the incident. Nisman was murdered hours before he was due to testify against the former president, which the Federal Court of Buenos Aires ruled was a \u201cdirect consequence\u201d of Nisman's accusations against Kirchner. In 2017, Judge Claudio Bonadio accused Kirchner of treason and called on the country's senate to permit her arrest and trial for allegedly covering up Iranian involvement in the 1994 bomb attack. Kirchner is currently referred for public trial over alleged cover-up of Iranian involvement in the bombing.\n\nThe thirteenth anniversary of the bombing was commemorated on 18 July 2007. In addition to nationwide exhibitions and ceremonies, radio and television stations and police cars all across Argentina sounded sirens at 9:53\u00a0am, the time of the bombing. In 2019, Argentina officially declared Hezbollah a terrorist organization.\n\n==Bombing==\nOn 18 July 1994, a suicide bomber drove a Renault Trafic van bomb loaded with about  of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and fuel oil explosive mixture, into the Jewish Community Center building located in a densely constructed commercial area of Buenos Aires. The explosive is thought to have been arranged to focus the blast on the building  away, exhibiting a shaped charge or explosively formed penetrator effect. The exterior walls of this five story building were of brick masonry construction, which supported the floor slabs. The air blast from the bomb totally destroyed the exposed load-bearing walls which, in turn, led to progressive failure of the floor slabs and virtually total collapse of the building. Such bearing-wall buildings are notable for their tendency to be brought down in this manner by localized damage.\n\nIn the days following the bombing, Israel sent Mossad agents to Argentina to investigate. The Israeli Police also sent a team of four forensic scientists to assist with the building of ante mortem files and victim identification; the IDF sent personnel to help the Argentines with body extrication. Argentina closed its borders after the attack, fearing more terrorists could enter. It was thought possible that the bombers entered Argentina through the Triple Frontier, where the borders of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay meet. Argentina's intelligence agency, the Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia (SIDE), is said to have set up a network of surveillance called \"Centauro\" in Paraguay.\n\n===Other bombings===\nThe bombing came two years after the 17 March 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires which killed 29 and wounded 242, and was Argentina's deadliest attack until the AMIA bombing. The Islamic Jihad Organization, which according to Robert Baer operates under the umbrella of Hezbollah and is linked to Iran, claimed responsibility for that bombing. It was suspected that the AMIA bombing was connected to the embassy attack. To date, authorities have been unable to locate those responsible for either of the two bombings.\n\nThe day after the AMIA attack, a suicide bombing on a Panamanian commuter plane killed all 21 passengers, 12 of whom were Jews. Investigators determined that the bombing was perpetrated by a \"Lya Jamal\" \u2013 thought to be \"an Arab traveling under an alias, using fraudulently obtained Colombian documents.\"\n\nEight days after the AMIA attack, the Israeli embassy in London was car-bombed, and thirteen hours later a similar car bomb exploded outside a Jewish community centre in London. No one was killed but 22 were injured and \"millions of pounds of damage\" was done. Five Palestinians were later arrested in London and two convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison in connection with the bombings.\n\n==Investigation and responsibility==\n\n\nIn 2018 judicial authorities announced that former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner would face trial on charges she covered up the role of Iranians in bombing. Federal Judge Claudio Bonadio said that eleven other former officials and people close to Kirchner's government will also be tried on charges of cover-up and abuse of power. Kirchner has denied the charges.\n\nNo suspects have been convicted for the bombing and there have been a number of allegations made, with later investigations charging the government of Iran. The investigations were marred by incompetence. In 1999 an arrest warrant was issued against Hezbollah member Imad Mugniyah in connection with the attack. Argentine justice accused Tehran in 2006 of being behind the attacks, and indicted several senior Iranian officials, including Hashemi Rafsanjani and Ahmad Vahidi, as well as Hezbollah's Imad Mughniyah. In 2007, several of the charged were placed on Interpol's most wanted list, however Interpol's bylaws prevented listing top officials such as Rafsanjani. As of 2017 the charged suspects (who remain alive) remain fugitives.\n\n===Claim of responsibility===\nShortly after the attack Ansar Allah, a Palestinian Jihadist organization widely held as a front for Hezbollah, claimed responsibility for the attack, and for the Alas Chiricanas Flight 901 bombing via leaflets distributed in Sidon and a communique in the Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar.\n\n===Ibrahim Hussein Berro===\nIsraeli diplomatic sources who read the \"final\" report by SIDE on the attack said in 2003 that the attack was a suicide bombing carried out by Ibrahim Hussein Berro, a 21-year-old Hezbollah operative who has been honored with a plaque in southern Lebanon for his \"martyrdom\" on 18 July 1994, the date of the bombing. This investigation was carried out jointly with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. Hussein had been identified by FBI and Argentine intelligence, and corroborated by at least three witnesses. According to official Argentine government prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, Hussein's two US-based brothers had testified that he had joined the radical Shia militant group Hezbollah. \"The brothers' testimony was substantial, rich in detail and showed that he was the one who was killed,\" Nisman added.\n\nHowever, a BBC correspondent reported that \"independent\" investigators were skeptical, and they pointed out repeated incompetence and deception in the official investigation. No proper autopsies or DNA tests were done. The police had also simply dumped a head, thought to be that of the bomber, into a bin.\n\nOn 5 July 2017, The Algemeiner reported that DNA not assignable to any of the victims has been identified. This new evidence will allow investigators to test the prevailing suspicion that the bombing was committed by  Ibrahim Hussein Berro.\n\n===Juan Jos\u00e9 Galeano's investigations===\nFederal judge Juan Jos\u00e9 Galeano followed investigations concerning the \"local connection\", which included members of the Polic\u00eda Bonaerense (Buenos Aires Provincial Police). He quickly arrested Carlos Telleld\u00edn, alleged to have provided the van used in the bombing, and some 20 officers from the Bonaerense. But a video broadcast on Argentine TV showed him offering Telleld\u00edn $400,000, in return for evidence, which led to Galeano's removal from the case in 2003, and his impeachment in August 2005.\n\nJudge Galeano had also issued warrants for the arrests of 12 Iranians, including Hade Soleimanpour, Iran's ambassador to Argentina in 1994. The latter was arrested in the UK on 21 August 2003, at the request of the Argentine authorities. He was later released because, according to the Home Office, there was not even enough evidence presented to make a prima facie case for the extradition to proceed.\n\nJudge Galeano also interviewed Abolghasem Mesbahi, aka \"Witness C\", an alleged former Iranian intelligence officer who reportedly said a former Argentine president accepted a $10 million payment from Tehran to block the investigation. Former President Carlos Menem denied the claims, but admitted he had a secret Swiss bank account following a report in The New York Times. Menem claimed in 2004 that the attack had been related to his support to the US during the First Gulf War and to his visit to Israel during his mandate. Abolghasem Mesbahi claimed to the Argentine court that Iran had planned the bombing, thinking the centre was a base for the Israeli secret service.\n\nOn 2 September 2004, all suspects in the \"local connection\" (among whom members of the Buenos Aires police) of AMIA case were found to be not guilty. Five persons, including four policemen, were therefore acquitted because of lack of evidence.\n\nOn 3 August 2005, Judge Galeano's impeachment was successful, and he was formally removed from his post as a federal judge for \"serious\" irregularities and his mishandling of the investigation. Argentine newspaper Clar\u00edn reports that charges will be pressed against him shortly. Judge Galeano has denied these allegations.\n\nIn March 2005, Swiss judge Jacques Antenen, in charge of investigations concerning the murder of an Iranian dissident, re-opened the case concerning Iranian intelligence service bank accounts in Switzerland. The same account would have been used both for this assassination and for the alleged payment of ex-President Carlos Menem. Swiss Justice had already been notified of the existence of an account owned by the Red Spark Foundation (based in Liechtenstein), in which Ram\u00f3n Hern\u00e1ndez, former secretary of Carlos Menem, had authority to sign documents. Six million dollars would have been deposited in this account, although in some moment the exact amount was said to be of $10 million.\n\nIn 2006, the Court of Cassation declared that the previous court had made a false version of the investigated acts in order to cover irresponsibilities.\n\n===Investigations under N\u00e9stor Kirchner's government===\nN\u00e9stor Kirchner's government issued a decree in July 2005 formally accepting a share of the blame for the failure of investigations about the attack. He called the unresolved investigations a \"national disgrace.\". President Kirchner said governments had covered up facts, and that the decree established a mechanism for victims to receive compensation. Shortly after assuming his functions in spring 2003, he opened up Argentine intelligence files on the case, and lifted a decree preventing SIDE agents from testifying in the case.\n\nArgentina's justice, Israel, and the United States suspected in 2005 that Hezbollah was behind the attack, with backing from Iran. Hezbollah has denied responsibility. The Iranian government maintains its innocence, condemning the terrorist attack and calling for urgent punishment of those responsible.\n\nOn 25 October 2006, prosecutors in Buenos Aires formally charged Iran and Shi'a militia Hezbollah with the bombing, accusing the Iranian authorities of directing Hezbollah to carry out the attack and calling for the arrest of former President of Iran Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani and seven others, including some who still hold official positions in Iran.\n\nThe Justice of Argentine called for the arrest of top Iranian authorities. The Iranian defense minister, Ahmad Vahidi was accused of masterminding the attack.\n\nArgentine's government required the extradition of those accused of the attack but Iran has always refused to accept the verdict of the Argentine's Justice.\n\nIn November 2007, Interpol on behalf of the Argentine government, published the names of six individuals (Imad Mughniyah, Ali Fallahijan, Mohsen Rabbani, Ahmad Reza Asghari, Ahmad Vahidi and Mohsen Rezaee) officially accused for their role in the terrorist attack. They were entered in the Interpol red notice list.\n\nSpeaking on state radio, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hoseyni described the accusations against the country as \"a Zionist plot\". Both Hezbollah and Iran deny any involvement in the bombing. According to Hoseyni, the accusations were intended to divert \"world attention from the perpetration of crimes by the Zionists against women and children in Palestine\".\n\nOn 6 March 2007, former Congressman Mario Cafiero and former government official Luis D'Elia provided evidence at a press conference that Abolghasem Mesbahi, along with two other Iranians that gave alleged evidence implicating Iran in the bombing, were members of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK), which is an organization that advocates the overthrow of the Islamic Republic of Iran and was designated until 2012 as a terrorist organization by the US. They also said that there were arrest warrants issued by Interpol for the other two Iranians, Hadi Roshanravani and Hamid Reza Eshagi.\n\n===Developments under Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner's government===\n\nIn November 2008, Carlos Menem was called to testify in an upcoming trial over the AMIA case.\n\nIn March 2009, a former investigator in the case, Claudio Lifschitz, claimed he was abducted and tortured by men who told him not to investigate SIDE's involvement in the case.\n\nIn August 2009, BBC News reported that Ahmad Vahidi had become Iran's defense minister-designate under the 2009 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad administration, and is on Interpol's wanted list over the AMIA bombing. Vahidi led a unit of Iran's Revolutionary Guard called Quds Force at the time of the attack, and has been accused of planning the bombings. Iran dismissed this development as a \"Zionist plot\". On 1 June 2011, Bolivia apologized to Argentina for Ahmad Vahidi's unannounced visit to the country, and announced that he would be leaving Bolivia immediately.\n\nOn 31 March 2012, Menem was ordered to stand trial for obstruction of justice in the probe of the AMIA bombing. Menem is accused of helping to cover up the tracks of local accomplices of the attackers.\n\nIn 2012, Argentina's President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner announced at the United Nations General Assembly that Iran and Argentina would meet to discuss Iranian involvement in the attacks. In 2014  she also criticized her country's Jewish leaders for not supporting Argentina's pact with Iran in order to jointly investigate the 1994 AMIA bombing attack:\n\n\nMy country is the only country of the Americas other than the United States of America that was the target of terrorist attacks: one in 1992 when the embassy of Israel was blown up, and the second in 1994 when the headquarters of the Asociaci\u00f3n Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA) was bombed. This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the bombing of AMIA. I dare say before this Assembly\u2014in the presence of some of the family members of the victims who have always been with us\u2014that the Government headed by President Kirchner did the utmost and went the greatest lengths to uncover the real culprits, not only because it opened all my country's intelligence files and created a special prosecutor investigation unit, but also because, when in 2006 the justice system of my country accused Iranian citizens of involvement in the bombing of AMIA, I myself was the only President who dared to propose asking the Islamic Republic of Iran to cooperate with and assist in the investigation. That request was made intermittently from 2007 to 2011, until the Islamic Republic of Iran finally agreed to a bilateral meeting, allowing it to be included in the agenda. That meeting led to the signing by both countries of a memorandum of understanding on legal cooperation that allowed for the Iranian citizens who had been accused, and who live in Tehran, to be deposed before the judge. But what happened when we signed that memorandum? It seemed as if all hell had broken out, both nationally and internationally. The Jewish associations that had sought our support for so many years and that had come here with us to ask for help turned against us, and when an agreement was finally reached on legal cooperation they accused us of complicity with the State of Iran. The same thing happened here in the United States. When the vulture funds lobbied before the United States Congress, they accused us of collaborating with the Islamic Republic of Iran, which at the time was known as the Terrorist State of Iran. They even lobbied on their websites, posting pictures of me on the Internet with former President Ahmadinejad as if we were business partners. Just this week, we learned that the iconic Waldorf Astoria hotel, in this city, was the setting for a meeting between the Secretary of State of this country and his Iranian counterpart. We are not criticizing them. Quite the contrary, anything that represents dialogue and understanding seems very good to us. But we wish to ask those who have been accusing Iran of being a terrorist State.\n\nArgentina's Foreign Minister Hector Timerman and Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi met on the sidelines of the UN in New York and promised to continue talks until the 1990s bombings are resolved.\n\n==Memorandum of understanding==\n\n\nOn 27 January 2013, the Government of Argentina announced it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Iran to establish a \"truth commission\" to investigate the AMIA bombing. According to President Kirchner, the commission was established to \"analyze all the documentation presented to date by the judicial authorities of Argentina and Iran\u2026and to give its vision and issue a report with recommendations about how the case should proceed within the legal and regulatory framework of both parties.\"\n \nThe news generated several criticisms with David Harris from the American Jewish Committee stating that \"the idea of establishing a 'truth' commission on the AMIA tragedy that involves the Iranian regime would be like asking Nazi Germany to help establish the facts of Kristallnacht\". The U.S. State Department's top official in charge of Latin American affairs, Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson, said she is \"skeptical that a just solution can be found\" through the Argentine-Iran \"truth-commission.\" The Jewish community in Argentina issued the statement \"to ignore everything that Argentine justice has done and to replace it with a commission that, in the best of cases, will issue, without any defined deadline, a 'recommendation' to the parties constitutes, without doubt, a reversal in the common objective of obtaining justice.\"\n\nOn 28 February 2013, the Argentine Chamber of Deputies approved the memorandum of understanding with Iran by 131 votes in favor to 113 votes against. Israel expressed disappointment at this development. Guillermo Borger, president of the AMIA, criticized the legality of the memorandum and announced that he would take it to the Supreme Court of Argentina.\n\nIn May 2014, the memorandum was declared unconstitutional by the Court. The memorandum was voided when Mauricio Macri became president of Argentina, as he withdrew the appeal that the Kirchners government had filed.\n\n==Recent developments==\n\nOn 24 May 2013, it was reported that two of the Iranian AMIA bombing suspects accused of having planned the attack, Mohsen Rezai and Ali Akbar Velayati, are current candidates for the Iranian presidential elections. In May 2013, Prosecutor Alberto Nisman published a 502-page indictment accusing Iran of establishing terrorist networks throughout Latin America \u2013 including in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Chile, Colombia, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and Suriname \u2013 dating back to the 1980s. Nisman also said new evidence underscored the responsibility of Mohsen Rabbani, the former Iranian cultural attache in Argentina, as mastermind of the AMIA bombing and \"coordinator of the Iranian infiltration of South America, especially in Guyana\", and said US court documents showed Islamist militant Abdul Kadir \u2013 who was sentenced to life in prison in 2010 for participating in a foiled plan to attack John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York \u2013 was Rabbani's disciple.\n\nThe JTA reports that ex-interior minister of Argentina, Carlos Vladimir Corach, is to be investigated for his ties to the AMIA Jewish center bombing. He is alleged to have provided an illegal payment of $400,000 to Carlos Telleldin.\n\n\nIn an interview with Buenos Aires-based Jewish news agency (Agencia Jud\u00eda de Noticias) on 2 January 2013, Itzhak Aviran, who was the Israeli ambassador to Argentina from 1993 to 2000, said most of the people behind the AMIA attack were eliminated by Israeli security agents operating abroad. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor called Aviran's declarations \"complete nonsense\".\n\nIn January 2015, the prosecutor in charge of the AMIA bombing investigation, Alberto Nisman, filed a 300-page complaint accusing President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner and Foreign Minister H\u00e9ctor Timerman among other pro-government political figures of \"covering up\" Iranian citizens allegedly involved in the 1994 attack. Nisman said his accusations were based on phone taps on close political allies of Fern\u00e1ndez, who he said conspired in a \"sophisticated criminal plan\" to negotiate with Rabbani himself, one of the main suspects of perpetrating the deadly bombing. According to the accusation, Iranian oil would be exchanged for Argentinian grain, while Argentina would cancel an international Interpol arrest warrant against Rabbani and other senior Iranian officials. Nisman demanded a preventive embargo of 200 million pesos on Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner and requested to question her, as well as Timerman, lawmaker of the pro-government organization \"La C\u00e1mpora\" Andr\u00e9s Larroque, political leader Luis D'El\u00eda, the leader of Quebracho Fernando Esteche, members of Secretariat of Intelligence, the leader of the Iranian community in Argentina Jorge \"Yussuf\" Khali, and ex attorney and judge H\u00e9ctor Yrimia. On 18 January 2015, Nisman was found dead at his home in Buenos Aires, hours before he was due to explain his allegations at the Argentine parliament. A gun and spent shell casing were found next to the body, and a government official said the death was likely a suicide although others considered the death suspicious. The judge Ariel Lijo returned immediately from his vacations to work in the case, and to order the protection of Nisman's proofs. Nisman was replaced by prosecutor Alberto Gentili.\n\nIn the week following Nisman's death, and despite the fact that Nisman was going to implicate her among others had he lived, President Kirschner declared her determination to replace the Argentinian secret security service completely because it had been run beyond the state's control for too long.\n\nIn March 2015, three former Venezuelan government officials interviewed by Veja stated that Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad allegedly met in 2007 to discuss payments to the Argentine government of Cristina Kirchner in order for Iran to receive Argentine nuclear technology and the cessation of work between Argentina and Interpol involving Iranian individuals.\n\nIn March 2015, the Argentinian government released a full-page advertisement in national newspapers accusing the late prosecutor Alberto Nisman of having attempted to destabilise the country. The advertisement also argued that the country should revive a controversial agreement with Iran, the country that is suspected of being responsible for the bombings. In addition to that, during a speech president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner accused Israel of being responsible for the 1992 bombing of the Israeli embassy in Argentina. This accusation was based on the allegation that Israel was only demanding justice for the AMIA bombing but not for the embassy attack. This was immediately refuted by the Israeli embassy, which reaffirmed that it does in fact demand justice for both cases.\n\nIn December 2015, Radio Mitre, an Argentinean station, released secret tapes of H\u00e9ctor Timerman, in which he admitted Iran was responsible for the bombings concurrent to negotiating with Iran.\n\nOn 26 February 2016, the Argentine prosecutor Ricardo S\u00e1enz stated Nisman's death \"was a homicide indeed\", claiming the case should be directed to the federal justice.\n\nOn 18 July 2019, at the request of Israel and the United States, Argentina officially declares Hezbollah a terrorist organization, freezing assets and expelling all members of the organization from the country, which is held responsible for the 1994 attack against AMIA.\n\n==Alleged assassinations of perpetrators==\nIn January 2014, Yitzhak Aviran, who had been Israel's ambassador to Argentina at the time, claimed in an interview with a Spanish-language Jewish newspaper that most of the perpetrators of the attack had been tracked down and killed by Mossad, Israel's secret service, saying \"a majority of those responsible for the act are no longer alive, and we took care of this on our own.\"  Aviran's statements caused concern in Argentina, whose Foreign Minister, H\u00e9ctor Timerman, accused Israel of having thus \"prevented the gathering of new evidence that could shed light on the affair.\" Argentina also summoned the Israeli charg\u00e9 d'affaires to ask for explanations about Aviran's statements. For its part, the Israeli government, through its own Foreign Ministry, dismissed Aviran's claims as \"complete nonsense.\"\n\n==Other opinions==\nAccording to a report in The Nation, the author claims that James Cheek, United States Ambassador to Argentina at the time of the bombing, told him, \"To my knowledge, there was never any real evidence [of Iranian responsibility]. They never came up with anything.\" The hottest lead in the case, he recalled, was an Iranian defector named Manoucher Moatamer, who \"supposedly had all this information.\" But Moatamer turned out to be only a dissatisfied low-ranking official without the knowledge of government decision-making that he had claimed. \"We finally decided that he wasn't credible,\" Cheek recalled.\n\n==Cultural depictions==\n\nTen years after the terrorist attack, a group of 10 Argentine directors, each financed by a different production company, filmed a collection of 10 shorts in tribute to the victims of the attack. The shorts were collected in the film 18-j, dubbed thus in reference to the date of the attack. The directors were Daniel Burman, Israel Adri\u00e1n Caetano, Luc\u00eda Cedr\u00f3n, Alejandro Doria, Alberto Lecchi, Sergio Ren\u00e1n, Marcelo Schapces, Carlos Sor\u00edn, Juan Bautista Stagnaro, Adri\u00e1n Suar and Mauricio Wainrot; a small introduction was narrated by actress Norma Aleandro. Each short showed a different scene in the lives of those who witnessed the attack first-hand. The film premiered 19 August 2004.\n\nIn 2009, Marcos Carnevale directed Anita, a full-length film which portrays a young woman (Alejandra Manzo) with Down Syndrome who is lost in Buenos Aires after her mother is killed in the AMIA bombing.\n\n==See also==\n\n* Israeli embassy attack in Buenos Aires\n* History of the Jews in Argentina\n* Argentina\u2013Israel relations\n* Pasteur - AMIA (Buenos

{"title":"2011 Fuzhou, Jiangxi bombings","article":"The 2011 Fuzhou bombings were three separate, synchronized explosions at government buildings in Fuzhou, Jiangxi, China on the morning of 26 May 2011. At least three people died, and at least seven were injured. The perpetrator, 52-year-old Qian Mingqi, was initially reported possibly among those killed in the blasts, leading China's state run news agencies to label it a suicide bombing. The Jiangxi Provincial Public Security Department later confirmed that the suspect died at the scene.\n\nThe three explosions occurred between 9:18 and 9:45am CST (0100 UTC). The first blast occurred in a parking lot outside the offices of the city prosecutor, the second inside a district administration office, and the third explosion hit the city's food and drug agency. Two of the bombs were placed inside cars parked just outside the buildings. The official Xinhua news agency had posted a news article on its website saying the bombs were planted by a disgruntled farmer who was dissatisfied with the outcome of a court case, but by 1pm on the day of the bombing the article had been removed from the site.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1995 Qian Mingqi's home was demolished by government authorities to make way for a highway.  He then saved up enough money to build a second home, which was also shattered by a second forced demolition.  His second house cost about 500,000 yuan, and the authorities paid him only half of that for compensation. Because of the lack of compensation, he posted slogans to resist the demolition.  According to his neighbors, Qian's wife was then hung upside down by the demolition team.  She died a few years later from gall bladder disease.  From the police report of the Fuzhou Police, Qian's wife has been dead for several years.\n\nAfter the ordeal he then discovered the land seized from him to make a highway was actually not used. By 2002 Qian began petitioning in Fuzhou and Beijing's government offices. Unable to find redress, he reportedly taught himself to use the internet, and cultivate a presence on various blogging platforms, hoping to get the attention of human rights defenders, academics, lawyers, reporters, and police. Not only did Qian fail to elicit the attention of anyone who might help him, but he became aware of other individuals who had similarly had their homes demolished. In one of his blog he accused Linchuan district party cadre of embezzling 10 million yuan in compensation funds after demolishing his house and that of seven other families. Qian had two sons and one daughter.\n\nBombings, especially ones of this sophistication, are rare in China, but this was the second in a month. Earlier in May 2011 in north-west Gansu province a \"petrol bomb\" was set off outside a bank by a former employee. There are very few ways for the Chinese people to redress or raise awareness of what they see as a wrong they have suffered, and therefore, as the BBC's Michael Bristow states, \"some Chinese people occasionally take out their frustration in attacks like this.\"\n\n==Incident==\nAccording to Mingqi's Sina Weibo site and the 2002 demolitions, Qian was fed up. The weibo posts state \"Ten years of seeking redress resulted in nothing,\" and \"I was forced to step onto a road I didn't want to step on due to the loss of my newly built house, which was illegally demolished...my total loss was near to RMB two million Yuan.\"\n who wrote on Sina.com's weibo (microblogging) service, Sina Weibo, that his home had been demolished illegally.\nHe wrote the last statement in his weibo: \"I want to learn from Dong Cunrui [a People's Liberation Army soldier who carried an explosive package and blew up a bunker in 1948] and I hope I can receive the public's support and attention.\"\n\nThe bombs were detonated by Qian Mingqi, aged 52 at the time, who was killed in the explosions. Two victims are security guards of the Linchuan district government building, Xu Yingfu and\nHe Haigen.\n\nTime magazine reported:\n\"The first bomb, in a vehicle parked inside the gate of the local prosecutor's office, went off at about 9:15 a.m., according to local media reports. A second bomb detonated at 9:30 a.m. at a district government office, and a third bomb, believed to be a car bomb like the first, went off at 9:45 a.m. outside a local office of the State Food and Drug Administration.\"\n\nThe explosion blew most of the windows out of the local prosecutor's office, an eight-story building, and at least ten cars were destroyed.\n\n==Censorship==\n\nLocal journalists in Fuzhou stated that the Chinese police confiscated record-taking materials and deleted photographs from cameras. An early report posted on the official Xinhua News site was later removed from the website. Officials from the city were supposed to hold a news conference about the bombings, but it was canceled at the last minute, leading to further accusations of censorship.\n\n==Response==\nMany Chinese bloggers, weibo and Twitter users expressed sympathy for Qian Mingqi, with some calling him a \"hero\", and comparing him to Yang Jia, who killed Shanghai policemen after allegedly suffering mistreatment. Following the bombings, Qian's weibo page had attracted some 30,000 followers, before being shut down by Sina administrators. The Christian Science Monitor reported that most of the online commentators regarded Qian's actions not as a terrorist attack, but as  \"righteous vengeance:\"  \"The flood of supportive comments online since his death is a sign of widespread public frustration at the government's disdain for ordinary citizens.\" VOA reported on 27 May that the death of Qian has sounded an alarm bell for Chinese government, and one blogger has said on his Twitter account:\"...history will always remember Qian.\"\n\nIn an interview, Li Chengpeng, one of China's most popular and influential bloggers, said \"Qian was no Bin Laden, he was one of the weak, he had no way to express himself nor defend his rights.\"\n\nThe Associated Press explained the outpouring of sympathy for Qian by observing that many citizens could relate to his tale of victimization at the hands of authorities, and to his frustration at the lack of channels to seek redress. The Associated Press observed that \"Qian's grievances resonate widely in China, where land disputes have mushroomed amid a fast-paced economic boom. Standoffs between tenants and developers often turn violent, with homeowners beaten by thugs or even crushed by bulldozers. Other tenants have set themselves on fire rather than face eviction.\"\n\nThe state-run Global Times newspaper issued a report after the bombings calling for a condemnation of the violence, but also proposed that more needed to be done to understand why individuals like Qian are occasionally driven to lash out. The article quoted Mao Shoulong, a professor of public policy at Renmin University of China, saying that while extreme actions to seek redress should not be encouraged in any way, \"At the same time, authorities should learn to open smoother channels for the public to file their complaints before problems turn into confrontations and then violence.\"\n\n\"Despite enormous attention being paid to the cause of the attack, we must lament the deaths of innocent people whose families and friends are now suffering...This horrendous act, no matter its origin, deserves the most vehement condemnation,\" the author said in one article with title \"Horrendous attacks deserve public condemnation\" in the observer column of the Global Times.\n\n==See also==\n*2010 Austin plane crash\n*Social issues in the People's Republic of China\n*Suicide in the People's Republic of China\n*Socialist Harmonious Society\n*Terrorism in the People's Republic of China\n*Deng Yujiao incident\n*Weiquan movement\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n* Perpetrator's account at Sina Weibo","urls":["https:\/\/www.thestar.com\/news\/world\/article\/997238--three-dead-in-chinese-bombings","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2011\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/05\/26\/china.blast\/index.html?hpt=T2","http:\/\/ibnlive.in.com\/news\/china-serial-blasts-rare-case-of-suicide-bombing\/154784-2.html","http:\/\/china.globaltimes.cn\/society\/2011-05\/659581.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20120312231552\/http:\/\/china.globaltimes.cn\/society\/2011-05\/659581.html","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-asia-pacific-13556366","https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/worldnews\/asia\/china\/8537228\/Three-Chinese-government-buildings-bombed.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/05\/27\/world\/asia\/27china.html","http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/portal\/site\/SCMP\/menuitem.2af62ecb329d3d7733492d9253a0a0a0\/?vgnextoid=a9290fe4b5230310VgnVCM100000360a0a0aRCRD&ss=China&s=News","http:\/\/www.zaobao.com\/wencui\/2011\/05\/taiwan110528.shtml","http:\/\/shanghaiist.com\/2011\/05\/27\/jiangxi-bomber-qian-mingqi.php","http:\/\/news.dayoo.com\/china\/201105\/27\/53868_16956189.htm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110530173558\/http:\/\/news.dayoo.com\/china\/201105\/27\/53868_16956189.htm","http:\/\/ibnlive.in.com\/news\/china-serial-blasts-rare-case-of-suicide-bombing\/154784-2.html","http:\/\/news.qq.com\/a\/20110527\/000492.htm","http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/news\/international\/article2051657.ece","http:\/\/www.asianews.it\/news-en\/Qian-Mingqi-blew-himself-up-to-demand-justice-and-call-attention-to-his-plight-21688.html","http:\/\/www.dfdaily.com\/html\/33\/2011\/5\/29\/610731.shtml","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110602194817\/http:\/\/www.dfdaily.com\/html\/33\/2011\/5\/29\/610731.shtml","http:\/\/globalspin.blogs.time.com\/2011\/05\/26\/chinese-city-shaken-by-multiple-bomb-blasts\/","http:\/\/www.bostonherald.com\/news\/international\/asia_pacific\/view.bg?&articleid=1340988&format=&page=1&listingType=intasia","http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/World\/Asia-Pacific\/2011\/0527\/Chinese-bomber-receives-outpouring-of-sympathy-online","http:\/\/www.voafanti.com\/gate\/big5\/www.voanews.com\/chinese\/news\/20110527-Jiangxi-Blast-122711704.html?commentSubmitted=y&field=","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20111002094123\/http:\/\/www.voafanti.com\/gate\/big5\/www.voanews.com\/chinese\/news\/20110527-Jiangxi-Blast-122711704.html?commentSubmitted=y&field=","http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/World\/Asia-Pacific\/2011\/0527\/Chinese-bomber-receives-outpouring-of-sympathy-online","http:\/\/www.bostonherald.com\/news\/international\/asia_pacific\/view.bg?&articleid=1340988&format=&page=1&listingType=intasia","http:\/\/china.globaltimes.cn\/society\/2011-05\/659581.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20120312231552\/http:\/\/china.globaltimes.cn\/society\/2011-05\/659581.html","http:\/\/opinion.globaltimes.cn\/observer\/2011-05\/659546.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110720164328\/http:\/\/opinion.globaltimes.cn\/observer\/2011-05\/659546.html"]}
{"title":"Bitter Blood","article":"For the television series Bitter Blood (2014 TV series)\n\n\nBitter Blood: A True Story of Southern Family Pride, Madness, and Multiple Murder (1988) is a non-fiction crime tragedy written by American author Jerry Bledsoe that reached #1 on the New York Times bestseller list.  Bitter Blood is composed of various newspaper articles (from the Greensboro News and Record) and personal eyewitness accounts of several homicides in 1984 and 1985. The setting for the majority of the book is located in rural North Carolina and, more specifically, in Rockingham County and Guilford County.\n\nIn a statement released by Barnes & Noble, Bitter Blood is described as a, \u201c\u2026real-life drama of three wealthy families connected by marriage and murder.  Bledsoe recounts the shocking events, obsessive love, and bitter custody battles which led to the bloody climax that took nine lives.\u201d\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn 1981, Susie Newsom (the niece and namesake of North Carolina Supreme Court Chief Justice Susie Sharp) and her husband Tom Lynch divorced and embarked in a bitter custody fight over their two sons, John and Jim. Shortly after the divorce, Susie became intimate with her first cousin, Fritz Klenner, a habitual liar who started a medical practice in Reidsville, North Carolina, without ever obtaining a medical degree or license.\n\nIn the summer of 1984, relatives of the former couple began to die across the country. At first, Lynch\u2019s mother Delores and sister Janie were murdered in cold blood in at their home in Oldham County, Kentucky, as Delores returned from a Sunday morning church service. Then on May 18, 1985, Newsom\u2019s father Bob, mother Florence, and grandmother Hattie were shot to death in their home in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Before his murder, Bob had agreed to testify in favor of Lynch at an upcoming custody hearing. Because of this lead, police began to speculate that Susie played a role in the murder of her family.\n\nSusie and Fritz became prime suspects in the murders. By June 1985, investigators had gathered substantial evidence and were about to make an arrest. However, on June 3, Fritz fired on police officers when they attempted to raid his Greensboro apartment, then fled the scene in an SUV with Susie and her two children. Fritz and the police became engaged in a low speed 15-minute police chase. When the SUV was stopped, Klenner opened fire with a machine gun, wounding three officers. Before they could respond in kind, he detonated an explosive charge inside the SUV, killing himself and his three passengers.\n\nAutopsies performed on the children showed that both boys had ingested cyanide and had been shot in the head at close range. Later the authorities determined that Susie Newsom ignited the explosives in the SUV.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n\nIn the wake of the deaths on June 3, 1985, forensics analysis began on the bodies of Fritz, Susie, John, and Jim. Both boys were found to have high levels of cyanide in their blood in addition to gunshot wounds to the head. It is assumed that due to the poison both children were unconscious during the police chase, and that either Susie or Fritz fatally shot them just prior to the explosion of the bomb. Susie's body was mangled from the waist down and many pieces of the seat were deeply embedded in her corpse. This led investigators to believe that the bomb was positioned underneath her seat, on the passenger side of Fritz's Blazer. Police officers found Fritz alive among the wreckage; however, he soon died from internal hemorrhaging.\n\nThe following day, June 4, the police searched the Klenner household and found numerous firearms, explosives, and prescription drugs. Over 15 guns, 30,000 rounds of ammunition, grenades, illegal military equipment, and a couple of claymores were found at Fritz's house. The police also found a case and a half of dynamite that was stored behind the Klenner residence. It is assumed that the missing half-case of dynamite was the cause of the explosion in the car. Inside Fritz's office, the police found evidence which showed that he was an admirer of Adolf Hitler and an avid supporter of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nWhile it is a common belief that Fritz Klenner had the means and the motive to commit the murders, it cannot be proven beyond a ballistics report that linked a bullet found at the scene of the Lynch killings with a gun that Klenner and Susie sold to a North Carolina gun dealer. Susie's role in the murders still remains unknown. The prevailing theories are either that she convinced Klenner to commit the murders on her behalf, and thus had foreknowledge of the crimes; or that she had none, and blindly refused to consider that Klenner was involved, seeing any attempt by the state to investigate his possible role as an unreasonable persecution.\n\nAnother figure in the case was Ian Perkins, a 21-year-old neighbor of Klenner's. Ian Perkins knew about Fritz's involvement in the murders of  Susie's family, since he had driven Klenner to their homes. Perkins had been told by Klenner that the murders were a CIA operation. In 1985, Perkins went on trial and was sentenced to four months in jail and over five years of probation; he is currently seeking a state pardon. Perkins was spared a life sentence thanks to a note from Fritz Klenner that read, \"\u201cI\u2019ll write a paper saying you were not knowingly involved, that you believed you were on a covert mission for the government.\"  The judge noted Ian's naivet\u00e9, gullibility, and immaturity as mitigating factors in his sentencing.\n\nPrior to the murders, in 1981, the SBI (State Bureau of Investigation) was given anonymous information that Fritz Klenner was \"a dangerous psychopath who was practicing medicine without a license.\"  However, no investigation ensued after the discovery of this information. In retrospect, the attorney general of the SBI, Rufus Edmisten, said that this vital piece of information was never brought to his attention. Edmisten later admitted that he wished he had done something about the situation prior to its escalation.\n\n==Adaptations==\nIn 1994, a television movie based upon the novel was produced and titled In the Best of Families: Marriage, Pride & Madness.  Jeff Bleckner, who also directed episodes of Medium, Hawthorne, and Boston Legal, was the director for this film. In the Best of Families has a runtime of 200 minutes and it was originally released and played on CBS in a two part series on January 16 and 18, 1994.\n It is re-run on cable under the title Bitter Blood. The story was also adapted for an episode of Southern Fried Homicide on Investigation Discovery.\n\n==See Also==\n*Murder of Zachary Turner\n*Murder of Carol DiMaiti\n*Powell family murders\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/www.barnesandnoble.com\/w\/bitter-blood-jerry-bledsoe\/1001894533","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/bitterblood00jerr","http:\/\/www.greensboro.com\/news\/crime\/summerfield-slaughter-years-ago-ended-in-deaths-of-couple-two\/article_5e74b69a-04af-11e5-9534-1393729c4a3c.html<\/ref>","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/bitterblood00jerr","https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0110124\/","http:\/\/investigation.discovery.com\/tv-shows\/southern-fried-homicide\/southern-fried-homicide-videos\/dating-her-first-cousin.htm<\/ref>"]}
{"title":"2011 Mogadishu bombing","article":"The 2011 Mogadishu bombing occurred on 4 October 2011, when a suicide bomber drove a truck into the gate of the Transitional Federal Government's ministerial complex in Mogadishu, Somalia. The resulting explosion killed 100 people and injured over 110 others. Al-Shabaab, an Islamist group, claimed responsibility for the attack. The attack is reported to be the largest since Al-Shabaab launched an insurgency in Somalia in early 2007. It also follows the withdrawal of Al-Shabaab's forces from the area in August after an AMISOM intervention to bring aid to the country during a season of drought.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the summer of 2011, the East African region faced a drought and shortage of food supplies, particularly in the Somali region, forcing tens of thousands of people to cross the borders into Ethiopia and Kenya for refuge. Al-Shabaab threatened to expel the aid groups working in the area before the African Union's AMISOM troops took action to force the Al-Shabaab fighters out of the region. \n\nIn July 2010, Al-Shabaab also claimed responsibility for a bombing in Kampala, Uganda, in retaliation for Uganda's support to, and presence in, AMISOM.\n\n==Attack==\nThe attack took place at a security checkpoint leading to the complex of ministries where the Ministry of Education's building is on the K4 (Kilometre Four) district of Mogadishu. Some eyewitnesses said the noise from the explosion was loud enough to be heard several miles from the scene of the attack. According to several reports the attack was aimed at 150 young Somalis who were to be flown to Sudan to be trained as spies, but instead resulted in the death of mostly students and parents awaiting news about scholarships to Sudan and Turkey from the Ministry of Higher Education. Turkey, which also increased its involvement in Somalia with a pledge to re-open its embassy in Mogadishu, released a statement clarifying the events that took place. The Turkish Foreign Ministry reported that the students were queuing outside the Ministry of Higher Education when the blast occurred, waiting for the results of scholarships offered by Turkey. Other reports said that students were taking an exam at the time of the blast. Although many of the casualties were students and parents, some of the other victims were non-student civilians. Suldan Sarah, the communications director for President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, said that \"security services are working around the clock, and are working within their capabilities, and as such have foiled a number of attempts over the past month [of other attacks].\" AMISOM and TFG (Transitional Federal Government) forces cordoned off the area soon after the blast.  \n\nOn the same day, Al-Shabaab simultaneously launched attacks in the south and west of Somalia.\n\n==Responsibility==\nAl-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack, saying: \"One of our mujahideen made the sacrifice to kill TFG [Transitional Federal Government] officials, the African Union troops and other informers who were in the compound.\" A spokesman for the group, Ali Mohamud Rage, later said that: \"Somalis, we warn you: keep away from government buildings and the bases of their soldiers, more serious blasts are coming.\"\n\n==Reactions==\n;Domestic\n* President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed said in a statement:  \"I am extremely shocked and saddened by this cruel and inhumane act of violence against the most vulnerable in our society\". His communications director, Suldan Sarah, said: \"To do a cowardly act like that does not mean you are a force to be reckoned with. It just means you can commit a mass murder using a suicide bomber. This is not the sign of strength, but rather a cowardly act.\"\n\n;International\n* \u2013 Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's spokesman Martin Nesirky said: \"it is incomprehensible that innocents are being senselessly targeted. The secretary-general is appalled by the vicious suicide bomb attack targeting government offices and ministries in Mogadishu today.\"\n* \u2013 Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan called Ahmed and offered to bring the wounded from the bombing to Turkey for medical treatment.\n* \u2013 White House's spokesman Jay Carney condemned the attacks saying: \"Those killed in the 'despicable and cowardly act' included students taking an exam in hopes of getting scholarships to study abroad.\"\n\n==See also==\n* Mogadishu bombing (disambiguation)\n* Somali Civil War\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/www.voanews.com\/policy\/editorials\/africa\/Murder-In-Mogadishu-131808193.html","http:\/\/www.liberation.fr\/depeches\/01012364375-somalie-l-attentat-de-mardi-a-fait-au-moins-82-morts","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2011\/oct\/04\/mogadishu-truck-bomb-al-shabaab","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2011\/10\/04\/us-somalia-conflict-idUSTRE79352E20111004","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-africa-15166107","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-africa-13937486","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/04\/30\/world\/africa\/somalia-famine-toll-in-2011-was-larger-than-previously-reported.html?ref=todayspaper&_r=0","https:\/\/www.ctc.usma.edu\/posts\/factors-responsible-for-al-shababs-losses-in-somalia","https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB10001424052748704288204575362400675683926","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/africa\/a-rescue-official-says-a-car-bomb-has-exploded-in-mogadishu-killing-55-people\/2011\/10\/04\/gIQAnHbKKL_story.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/10\/05\/world\/africa\/truck-bomb-kills-dozens-in-somalias-capital.html","https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/africa\/suicide-bomb-kills-at-least-70-as-islamic-terrorists-target-somalia-2365582.html","http:\/\/www.presstv.ir\/detail\/202698.html","http:\/\/english.aljazeera.net\/news\/africa\/2011\/10\/201110492730534222.html","http:\/\/www.worldbulletin.net\/?aType=haber&ArticleID=79847","https:\/\/www.google.com\/hostednews\/afp\/article\/ALeqM5g_r9jtMVx_3rnesEaHEGRHYJYcqw?docId=CNG.206b7e3a2746fca52d7eb492b168be3f.521"]}

{"title":"2019 Bogot\u00e1 car bombing","article":"On 17 January 2019, a vehicle was driven into the General Santander National Police Academy in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. The truck forced its way into the facility, hit a wall and detonated, killing 22 people (including the perpetrator) and injuring 68 others. Suicide attacks are unusual in Colombia. The car contained about  of pentolite. It was the deadliest attack on the Colombian capital since the 2003 El Nogal Club bombing and the first terrorist attack on the capital since the 2017 Centro Andino bombing. The National Liberation Army (ELN) accepted responsibility for the attack and justified it as a response to the bombings made by the Colombian government during the unilateral ceasefire.\n\n==Background==\n=== Colombian conflict ===\nThe Colombian conflict started in 1964, although systematic violence in the country can be dated since the end of the 19th century (Thousand Days' War). The National Liberation Army (ELN) is one of the most prominent participants of the ongoing conflict. For decades, residents of Bogot\u00e1 lived in fear of being a victim of a bombing by leftist rebels or Pablo Escobar's Medell\u00edn drug cartel. But as Colombia's conflict has wound down, and the nation's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent.\n\nSporadic attacks have affected the city since the peace deal was initiated. The most prominent was an explosion at the upmarket Andino shopping mall in June 2017 which killed three people, including a French woman, and injured another 11. Police later arrested several suspected members of a far-left urban guerrilla group called the People Revolutionary's Movement for the bombing.\n\n=== Peace dialogue ===\nThe 2016 peace deal between the FARC and Colombian government resulted in the ELN gaining strength in the region. The Colombian government has attempted to establish peace dialogue with the ELN since 2017, though ELN groups have rejected conditions placed by the government, such as the end of criminal actions including violent attacks and kidnappings. The ELN, however, persisted that the Colombian government should continue dialogue without making any demands towards the group. Between 2017 and up until the attack, Colombian officials stated that the ELN had participated in at least 400 terrorist attacks in the nation since dialogue began, including the shoot down of a civilian helicopter and the kidnapping of its occupants.\n\n=== ELN in Venezuela ===\nAccording to InSight Crime, the ELN and FARC dissidents allegedly met together in Venezuela to form a potential alliance in October 2018. Sources based in the Arauca department in Colombia provided the information, with reports that the groups would participate in illicit activity together. It was also alleged that former FARC commander Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez participated in the talks with the ELN.\n\nIn November 2018, InSight Crime also reported that the ELN was present in over twelve Venezuelan states, spanning from the Colombia-Venezuela border in the west across Venezuela and into Brazil and Guyana to the east. Insight Crime states that Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was tolerant of the ELN, explaining that \"ELN\u2019s expansion in Venezuela has been marked by the Maduro administration\u2019s inaction and even encouragement towards the group\", with reports from Venezuelan NGO Fundaci\u00f3n Redes that the Venezuelan military had possibly armed ELN members.\n\n==Events==\n\n=== Planning ===\nAttorney General  identified the perpetrator as Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez, known as \"Mocho Kiko\" because of his missing hand due to a previous explosion, a 57-year-old from the northern department of Boyac\u00e1. Rojas is alleged to have been involved with the ELN for three decades and served as an intelligence chief for a branch of the group. Since 2011, Rojas is alleged to have been teaching guerrilla militants in Venezuela how to construct explosives.\n\nRicardo Carvajal, who was previously investigated for drug trafficking in 2012 but was acquitted of the charges, allegedly contracted Rojas for the bombing due to his experience. The bombing, according to Colombian authorities, had been planned for more than ten months. In May 2018, Colombian records show that Rojas purchased a 1993 Nissan Patrol from Mauricio Mosquera, who was previously charged with terrorism and rebellion. On 27 July 2018, the vehicle was officially inspected in Arauca, Arauca, a city found on the border of Colombia and Venezuela where the ELN mainly controls territory.\n\n=== Attack ===\nThe authorities stated that on 17 January 2019 at 9:30am, Rojas drove his grey 1993 Nissan Patrol loaded with  of pentolite to the campus of the General Santander National Police Academy and dropped off a passenger at a nearby bus stop. Rojas then reportedly drove his truck down a side street used for deliveries to make his way onto the campus. When a detection dog signaled explosives on the vehicle, the driver forced his vehicle through a security checkpoint and struck security guards. The explosives in the truck were then detonated near the women's dormitories at the police academy as students were leaving a promotion ceremony. It is unknown if the driver detonated the explosives or if it was possibly the individual he left near the bus stop who remotely triggered the device.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, the authorities began investigating Rojas's possible connections to either the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla movement, the Clan \u00dasuga organized crime gang, or FARC dissidents.\n\n=== Initial investigations ===\nOn 18 January, Defence Minister  identified Rojas Rodr\u00edguez as a long-time member of the ELN, within which he served as an explosives expert. Investigators were able to identify Rojas with security camera footage and fingerprints from his remaining hand.\n\nA second individual, who Attorney General Mart\u00ednez said \"had participated in the attack\", was arrested in Bogot\u00e1 at 2:30am on the day following the attack.  The individual was identified as Ricardo Carvajal after he allegedly confessed to the bombings over a telephone call investigators intercepted. He was found with a \"combatant's manual\" and numerous coveralls. Carvajal Salgar denied that he was involved in the attack and his family stated that the coveralls were used for the jobs he worked.\n\nAccording to Colombian authorities, there are on-going operations throughout Bogot\u00e1 and the department of Arauca to capture other individuals suspected of having been involved in the attack, and that the ELN was responsible despite the organization not taking claim for the attack as it has done in the past.\n\n=== Peace dialogue ends ===\nPresident Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez announced on 18 January that peace dialogue between the Government of Colombia and the ELN was officially suspended. Duque also demanded that Cuba extradite the ten ELN leaders that found refuge on the island nation during peace talks and the reactivation of their Interpol Red Notices, and he criticized Venezuela for providing refuge for the ELN on the Colombia-Venezuela border. In response to the request, Cuba's Foreign Minister announced that Cuba would abide by the protocols of ongoing negotiations between both parties.\n\nThe President of the National Constituent Assembly of Venezuela, Diosdado Cabello, denied any Venezuelan involvement in the attacks on 18 January. On 21 January, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo called for a \"concrete response\" from the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela on whether the ELN was present in Venezuela, explaining that prior to the attack, the Colombian government asked the Venezuelan government on the potential presence of ELN groups in Venezuela without a response. Holmes Trujillo also stated that the Maduro government had taken \"evasive positions\" when speaking about the ELN.\n\n===Claim of responsibility===\n\nELN accepted the responsibility for the attack, saying the bombing was carried out in retaliation for the Colombian government not honoring the ceasefire by carrying out attacks on its camps. It justified that government and the cadres of its security forces had therefore become legitimate targets and called for resuming peace dialogue. High Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos spoke out against its members being sheltered anymore now that it had claimed responsibility.\n\n==International reactions==\nA foreign national, identified as a female cadet from Ecuador, was killed in the attack, while three nationals from Panama, one from the United States and another also from Ecuador were wounded. Their respective governments have expressed their condemnation for the attack and assistance to their citizens.\n\n* Cuba: Cuba shared condolences with Colombia, with its foreign ministry stating Cuba \"will act with strict respect for the Protocols of Dialogue and Peace signed by the Government and the ELN, including the Protocol in Case of a Rupture in Negotiations\".\n* Ecuador: President Len\u00edn Moreno lamented the death of Erika Chic\u00f3, the Ecuadorian cadet killed in the attack, and expressed his condolences to Colombia. He also announced that he was to send Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner to Bogot\u00e1 accompanied by Chic\u00f3's relatives.\n* Panama: The Panamanian embassy in Bogot\u00e1 expressed its indignation at the attack, and provided a phone number for information about Panamanian cadets affected.\n* United States: The Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Kimberly Breier condemned the bombing and said: \"Our condolences and sympathies go to the victims and family members of those killed\", while the U.S. Embassy in Bogot\u00e1 offered its \"help in investigating this reprehensible attack\".\n\nArgentina, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, and the Organization of American States also condemned the attack.\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2019\/jan\/17\/car-bomb-explodes-at-police-academy-in-bogota","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190117200743\/https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2019\/jan\/17\/car-bomb-explodes-at-police-academy-in-bogota","https:\/\/www.eltiempo.com\/justicia\/investigacion\/pistas-sobre-el-ataque-con-carro-bomba-a-escuela-de-cadetes-de-la-policia-315988","http:\/\/caracol.com.co\/radio\/2019\/01\/17\/nacional\/1547744968_857681.html","https:\/\/www.eluniversal.com.co\/colombia\/lo-que-se-sabe-del-atentado-contra-la-policia-en-bogota-DF610261","https:\/\/www.kienyke.com\/krimen\/actos-terroristas-en-bogota","http:\/\/www.banrepcultural.org\/biblioteca-virtual\/credencial-historia\/numero-121\/guerra-de-los-mil-dias-reclutamientos-ascensos-y-deserciones","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2019\/jan\/17\/car-bomb-explodes-at-police-academy-in-bogota","https:\/\/www.eltiempo.com\/bogota\/explosion-en-centro-comercial-andino-de-bogota-100084","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/the_americas\/colombia-asks-cuba-to-arrest-eln-negotiators-for-car-bombing\/2019\/01\/18\/b2eb5a2e-1b87-11e9-b8e6-567190c2fd08_story.html?noredirect=on","http:\/\/www.lapatilla.com\/2019\/01\/18\/duque-clausura-dialogo-con-eln-en-cuba-y-lanza-velada-advertencia-a-venezuela\/","https:\/\/www.elheraldo.co\/colombia\/la-barbarie-golpea-colombia-589741","https:\/\/www.insightcrime.org\/news\/analysis\/farc-dissidents-eln-turn-venezuela-criminal-enclave\/","https:\/\/www.insightcrime.org\/news\/analysis\/eln-present-half-venezuela\/","https:\/\/www.elheraldo.co\/colombia\/soy-inocente-me-estan-culpando-de-algo-que-no-hice-ricardo-carvajal-590073","https:\/\/amp.theguardian.com\/world\/2019\/jan\/18\/bogota-bombing-police-academy-one-armed-bomb-expert-eln","https:\/\/www.eltiempo.com\/justicia\/jose-aldemar-rojas-rodriguez-fue-el-autor-material-del-atentado-en-escuela-de-policia-315766","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-latin-america-46904683","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190117191015\/https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-latin-america-46904683","https:\/\/www.eltiempo.com\/justicia\/conflicto-y-narcotrafico\/primeras-hipotesis-de-atentado-contra-escuela-de-policia-en-bogota-315758","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-latin-america-46922719","https:\/\/lta.reuters.com\/articulo\/colombia-ataque-idLTAKCN1PC11E-OUSLT","http:\/\/www.tribtown.com\/2019\/01\/18\/lt-colombia-bombing-the-latest-2\/","https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2019\/01\/colombia-asks-cuba-extradite-eln-rebels-bombing-kills-21-190120075529616.html","http:\/\/www.lapatilla.com\/2019\/01\/21\/colombia-maduro-respuesta-presencia-eln-venezuela\/","https:\/\/edition-m.cnn.com\/2019\/01\/21\/americas\/colombia-car-bomb-eln\/index.html?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F","https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/world\/colombia-eln-rebels-car-bomb-responsibility-1.4986955","https:\/\/www.eltiempo.com\/justicia\/delitos\/extranjeros-muertos-o-heridos-en-atentado-a-la-escuela-de-policia-en-bogota-315756","https:\/\/www.elespectador.com\/noticias\/el-mundo\/las-reacciones-de-la-comunidad-internacional-al-atentado-en-bogota-articulo-834528","https:\/\/twitter.com\/embpanamacol\/status\/1085940725265719297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1085940725265719297&ref_url=https:\/\/www.elespectador.com\/noticias\/el-mundo\/las-reacciones-de-la-comunidad-internacional-al-atentado-en-bogota-articulo-834528","https:\/\/www.france24.com\/en\/20190117-several-killed-suspected-car-bomb-blast-police-academy-bogota-colombia","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190117202955\/https:\/\/www.france24.com\/en\/20190117-several-killed-suspected-car-bomb-blast-police-academy-bogota-colombia","https:\/\/twitter.com\/PatoBullrich\/status\/1085950246507741185","http:\/\/agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br\/politica\/noticia\/2019-01\/bolsonaro-repudia-ataque-terrorista-na-colombia","https:\/\/www.elespectador.com\/noticias\/el-mundo\/las-reacciones-de-la-comunidad-internacional-al-atentado-en-bogota-articulo-834528","https:\/\/twitter.com\/Almagro_OEA2015\/status\/1085945458202198020?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1085945458202198020&ref_url=https:\/\/www.elespectador.com\/noticias\/el-mundo\/las-reacciones-de-la-comunidad-internacional-al-atentado-en-bogota-articulo-834528"]}
{"title":"2019 Khash\u2013Zahedan suicide bombing","article":"On February 13, 2019, a suicide bombing on the Khash\u2013Zahedan road in Sistan and Baluchestan Province of Iran killed at least 27 Revolutionary Guards and wounded another 13. It was one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Iran in years. The Salafi jihadist militant organization Jaish ul-Adl (\"Army of Justice\") said it carried out the bombing.\n\n== Bombing ==\nThe bomber targeted a bus transporting military personnel on the Khash\u2013Zahedan road (Road 95) in Sistan and Baluchestan province, near the border with Pakistan. The area is a refuge for militant separatist groups and drug smugglers. The bomber detonated a car full of explosives near the bus, killing 27 Revolutionary Guards and injuring 13. The soldiers were coming back to their cities after carrying out the border mission by the bus.\n\nJaish al-Adl, a group connected to Al-Qaeda and involved in some of the recent terrorist activities in southeast Iran took responsibility for the suicide bombing. In October 2018, 11 Iranian border Guards were kidnapped by the group, only 5 of them were released.\n\nThe Senior Revolutionary Guards commander of Iran said that the suicide bomber was a Pakistani national and one other member of the militant cell that planned the attack was also Pakistani. Furthermore, he claimed that three other members of militant cells were Iranian nationals from Sistan and Baluchestan. Out of those three Iranians, two were arrested.\n\n== Reactions ==\nAli Khamenei, Supreme Leader of Iran declared that \"It is evidently certain that the perpetrators of this crime are connected to the intelligence services of some of the countries inside as well as outside the region\". Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani vowed revenge against Jaish Al-Adl.\n\nIran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with India's External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and referring to both the 2019 Khash\u2013Zahedan suicide bombing and the 2019 Pulwama attack, he stated: \"Iran and India suffered from two heinous terrorist attacks in the past few days resulted in big casualties. Today in my meeting with Sushma Swaraj the Indian FM, when she had a stopover in Tehran, we agreed on close cooperation to combat terrorism in the region. Enough is enough!\"\n\n===Against Pkistan===\nIranian Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari asked Pakistan to conduct crack down against armed group Jaish al-Adl before Tehran \"takes it revenge.\" Pakistan offered Iran cooperation in investigating the bombing, and expressed sympathy for the victims of the attack. A Pakistani delegation was due to travel to Iran.\n\nBahram Qassemi, Iran Foreign Ministry spokesman declared \"Tehran will avenge the attack\" and said it would not tolerate what it saw as Pakistan's \"inability to stop cross-border attacks in Iran\". Ali Larijani, Iran's parliament speaker blamed Pakistan for the attack, saying that the attack was \"planned and carried out from inside Pakistan\". Muhammad Beghari, the military commander of Iran, told Pakistan to \"either confront the terrorist groups or allow Iranian forces in\".\n\n== Mourning ==\nThe mourning for the victims was held one day after the attack in Isfahan, Iran. The bodies of the victims were flown to Isfahan where press representatives and the affected families were waiting. The mourning ceremony was widely covered by media in Iran and the interview with families of the victims went viral in Iranian social media.\n\n== See also ==\n*2010 Zahedan bombings\n*2009 Zahedan bombing\n*2007 Zahedan bombings\n*Ahvaz military parade attack\n*Sistan and Baluchestan insurgency\n\n== References ==","urls":["https:\/\/www.tasnimnews.com\/fa\/news\/1397\/11\/24\/1946776\/","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-middle-east-47231959","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/02\/13\/world\/middleeast\/iran-bombing.html","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/middle_east\/report-at-least-20-guard-personnel-killed-in-iran-bombing\/2019\/02\/13\/947b8336-2fa8-11e9-8781-763619f12cb4_story.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190214122554\/https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/middle_east\/report-at-least-20-guard-personnel-killed-in-iran-bombing\/2019\/02\/13\/947b8336-2fa8-11e9-8781-763619f12cb4_story.html","https:\/\/www.presstv.com\/Detail\/2019\/02\/13\/588504\/Iran-IRGC-attack-Zarif-Warsaw-summit-US","https:\/\/www.euronews.com\/2019\/02\/19\/suicide-bomber-who-killed-27-members-of-irans-guards-was-pakistani-guards-commander","https:\/\/en.radiofarda.com\/a\/iran-revolutionary-guards-commander-says-suicide-bomber-pakistani\/29778561.html","http:\/\/english.khamenei.ir\/news\/6416\/Ayatollah-Khamenei-s-message-on-martyrdom-of-a-group-of-revolution","https:\/\/www.timesofisrael.com\/rouhani-claims-israel-us-behind-deadly-suicide-bombing-in-iran\/","https:\/\/www.presstv.com\/Detail\/2019\/02\/13\/588504\/Iran-IRGC-attack-Zarif-Warsaw-summit-US","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/middle_east\/the-latest-iran-says-sunni-group-bombed-elite-forces-bus\/2019\/02\/13\/56aefe2e-2fb3-11e9-8781-763619f12cb4_story.html","https:\/\/www.indiatoday.in\/world\/story\/enough-is-enough-says-iran-s-deputy-foreign-minister-during-meet-with-sushma-swaraj-on-terrorism-1457980-2019-02-17","https:\/\/www.timesofisrael.com\/after-blaming-israel-and-gulf-iran-now-fingers-pakistan-over-deadly-bus-attack\/","https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2019\/02\/iran-warns-pakistan-crack-jaish-al-adl-190216071021469.html","https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1464488","https:\/\/www.presstv.com\/Detail\/2019\/02\/13\/588488\/Iran-IRGC-Zaheda-roadside-bombing","https:\/\/www.nayadaur.tv\/2019\/02\/either-confront-terrorist-groups-or-allow-iranian-forces-to-enter-iran-threatens-pakistan","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/middle_east\/iran-points-to-pakistan-after-deadly-attack-on-guard\/2019\/02\/17\/fd894eb4-3299-11e9-8375-e3dcf6b68558_story.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190217163757\/https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/middle_east\/iran-points-to-pakistan-after-deadly-attack-on-guard\/2019\/02\/17\/fd894eb4-3299-11e9-8375-e3dcf6b68558_story.html","https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lUtPwjam824"]}

{"title":"2002 Mombasa attacks","article":"The 2002 Mombasa attacks was a two-pronged terrorist attack on 28 November 2002 in Mombasa, Kenya against an Israeli-owned hotel and a plane belonging to Arkia Airlines. An all-terrain vehicle crashed through a barrier outside the Paradise Hotel and blew up, killing 13 and injuring 80. At the same time, attackers fired two surface-to-air missiles at an Israeli charter plane. The Paradise Hotel was the only Israeli-owned hotel in the Mombasa area. The attacks were believed to be orchestrated by al-Qaeda operatives in Somalia in an attempt to disrupt the Israeli tourist industry on the African continent. Much speculation has occurred as to who the perpetrators are, but no complete list of suspects has been defined. The attack was the second al-Qaeda terrorist operation in Kenya, following the bombing of the U.S. embassy in Nairobi in 1998. Following the attack, the UN Security Council and other nations condemned the bombing.\n\n== Attacks ==\n\n=== Hotel bombing ===\nThree men in a 4-wheel drive SUV approached the gate of the Paradise Hotel and were questioned by security guards. One of the men leapt from the car and detonated an explosive vest he was wearing. The other two men rammed the vehicle through the barrier, crashing into the front entrance of the hotel and set off the bomb they had in the car. The blast occurred on the eve of Hanukkah just after some 60 visitors had checked into the hotel, all of them from Israel for a holiday stay. Thirteen people were killed and 80 injured. Ten Kenyans died in the attack and three Israelis, two of them children. Nine of the victims were dancers who had been employed to welcome hotel guests. In an overnight rescue mission, four Israeli military Hercules planes were sent to Mombasa to evacuate the dead and injured.\n\n=== Aircraft attack ===\n\nAlmost simultaneous to the attack on the hotel, two shoulder-launched Strela 2 (SA-7) surface-to-air missiles were fired at a chartered Boeing 757 airliner owned by Israel-based Arkia Airlines as it took off from Moi International Airport. The Arkia charter company had a regular weekly service flying tourists between Tel Aviv and Mombasa. Kenyan police discovered a missile launcher and two missile casings in the Changamwe area of Mombasa, about  from the airport. The pilots planned on an emergency landing in Nairobi after seeing the two missiles streak past them, but decided to continue to Israel. The airliner landed at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv about five hours later, escorted by Israeli F-15 fighter jets. Following the attack, all flights from Israel to Kenya were cancelled indefinitely.\n\n==Perpetrators==\nSheikh Omar Bakri Mohammed, leader of the London-based Islamic organisation Al Muhajiroun, said that warnings had appeared on the Internet. \"Militant groups who sympathise with Al-Qaeda warned one week ago that there would be an attack on Kenya and they mentioned Israelis,\" he said. Initially, Israeli government spokesmen denied that such a warning had been received. But four days after the blast, Brigadier-General Yossi Kuperwasser admitted that Israeli military intelligence were aware of a threat in Kenya, but that it was not specific enough. Former Mossad head Danny Yatom took a similar line, saying that Israel got so many terror warnings they were not taken seriously.\n\nIn Lebanon, a previously unknown group called the Army of Palestine has said it carried out the attacks and said it wanted the world to hear the \"voice of the refugees\" on the 55th anniversary of the partition of Palestine.\n\nOn 20 December 2006, Salad Ali Jelle, Defence Minister of Somalia's Transitional Federal Government, said that one of the suspects, Abu Taha al-Sudan, was an Islamic Courts Union leader fighting against the Transitional Federal Government in the 2006 Battle of Baidoa. On 14 September 2009, American troops killed Kenya-born Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan after a missile struck his car in the Barawe District, 250 kilometers south of Somalia's capital Mogadishu. Nabhan is believed to have bought the truck used in the 2002 bombing.\n\nFazul Abdullah Mohammed is a foreign leader of the jihadist fundamentalist group, Al-Shabaab, which has pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda. Mohammed was appointed leader of al-Qaeda operations in East Africa. He was a participating member of the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombing in Nairobi and was one of the masterminds behind the coordination of the attack in Mombassa. He saw the attack as a failure because of the Strela 2 missiles missing the plane during take off. \n\nMohammed Abdul Malik Bajabu confessed in 2007 to assisting in the car bombings that took place at The Paradise Hotel. He was arrested by Kenyan authorities and is currently imprisoned by the U.S. in Guantanamo Bay without any formal charges against him. There have been four other suspected attackers affiliated with the al-Qaeda cell in Kenya, but the Kenyan prosecutors have had trouble establishing guilt with certainty. The four Kenyan nationals have been acquitted for lack of evidence. \n\nThere also has been speculation of involvement by Somali terrorist organization known as, Al Ittihad al Islamiya (AIAI). AIAI has supposed ties with al-Qaeda. They had hoped that by sending a message to the Israelis through this attack, they would grow closer to achieving their goal of establishing a Somali Islamic state.\n\n=== Motivation ===\nIt is believed that the terrorist cell, al-Qaeda, sought out to severely diminish Israeli activities on the African continent. The two simultaneous attacks had a direct impact on the Israeli tourism industry. The Paradise Hotel was an Israeli owned beachfront property that many Israeli vacationers frequented. The Al-Shabaab militant group is majorly concentrated in Somalia and because of weak border security, often spills over into Kenya. Kenya has a minority Muslim population that has historically been alienated, and with a growing dissent for Western activities with Kenyan borders, it has enabled a growing number of jihadist Muslims in Nairobi. The Muslim community in Kenya has lost political and economic representation leading up to the attacks, which lead them to focus their loyalty on Islam and the Middle East, not the nation. This enabled the jihadist movement to acquire a strong grip within Kenya, as Kenyan nationals assisted in the attacks on the Paradise Hotel and on the Boeing 757.\n\n==International response==\nImmediately following the attacks, Israel began evacuating all Israeli citizens within Kenyan borders. A joint operation began between the United States and Israel in determining who the perpetrators were of the attack. President George W Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell of the United States, Israel's Foreign Minister Benyamin Netanyahu,  the Kenyan government, and United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Jack Straw all condemned the attack. The United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1450 condemning the attacks, Syria was the only country to not affirm the resolution due to the implied power of directly intervening in the affected country's internal affairs after a terrorist attack. They also found distaste with the repeated mention of Israel in the resolution, which was against their political view concerning the conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Palestine.\n\n=== Investigation ===\nAs a result of the U.S. embassy bombing in 1998 and the attacks in Mombassa, Kenya-U.S. cooperation between authorities has strengthened. It was a joint effort between Kenya, the U.S., and Israel to apprehend the attackers. They were able to determine that al-Qaeda operatives were behind the attacks due to the similarities between the incidents in Nairobi and Mombassa. The attackers had used car bombs sourced from local materials. To plan and coordinate the attacks, al-Qaeda operatives rented houses in affluent neighborhoods to meet up with the non-Kenyan suicide bombers. \n\n==== Aftermath ====\nIn 2003 Western countries advised all of their citizens against traveling to Kenya because of the terrorist threat. This negatively impacted Kenya's economy which was based mostly in the tourism industry. Following the advisories and the suspension of British Airways flights to Nairobi, the Kenyan economy began losing nearly $130 million per week. Kenya has always been a focus for Islamist terrorist organizations, the U.N. Habitat Program and the U.N. Environment Program are based in the country.\n\n== References==\n\n\n== External links==\n*   After Blast, Kenya Reviews Qaeda's Trail in East Africa, The New York Times, 1 December 2002\n*  ATTACKS IN MOMBASA: Kenyans Hunting for Clues; Bombing Toll Rises to 13, The New York Times, 30 November 2002\n*  THE GRIEVERS: Israelis Return in Trauma From Supposed Haven, The New York Times, 30 November 2002\n*  INVESTIGATION: U.S. Suspects Qaeda Link to Bombing in Mombasa, The New York Times, 30 November 2002\n*   Source of Bombs?

{"title":"1998 United States embassy bombings","article":"The 1998 United States embassy bombings were attacks that occurred on August 7, 1998. More than 200 people were killed in nearly simultaneous truck bomb explosions in two East African cities, one at the United States Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the other at the United States Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nThe attacks, which were linked to local members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, brought Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and their terrorist organization, al-Qaeda, to the attention of the U.S. public for the first time, and resulted in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) placing bin Laden on its ten most-wanted fugitives list. The FBI also connected the attack to Azerbaijan, as 60 calls were placed via satellite phone by bin Laden to associates in the country's capital Baku. Fazul Abdullah Mohammed and Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah were credited with being the masterminds behind the bombings.\n\n==Motivation and preparation==\nThe bombings are widely believed to have been revenge for U.S. involvement in the extradition, and alleged torture, of four members of Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) who had been arrested in Albania for an alleged series of murders in Egypt in the two months prior to the attacks. Between June and July, Ahmad Isma'il 'Uthman Saleh, Ahmad Ibrahim al-Sayyid al-Naggar, Shawqi Salama Mustafa Atiya and Mohamed Hassan Tita were all renditioned from Albania to Egypt, with the co-operation of the United States; the four men were accused of participating in the assassination of Rifaat el-Mahgoub, as well as a later plot against the Khan el-Khalili market in Cairo. The following month, a communique was issued warning the United States that a \"response\" was being prepared to \"repay\" them for their interference. However, the 9\/11 Commission Report claims that preparations began shortly after bin Laden issued his February 1998 fatwa.\n\n\nAccording to journalist Lawrence Wright, the Nairobi operation was named after the Holy Kaaba in Mecca; the Dar es Salaam bombing was called Operation al-Aqsa in Jerusalem, but \"neither had an obvious connection to the American embassies in Africa. Bin Laden initially said that the sites had been targeted because of the 'invasion' of Somalia; then he described an American plan to partition Sudan, which he said was hatched in the embassy in Nairobi. He also told his followers that the genocide in Rwanda had been planned inside the two American embassies.\" Wright concludes that bin Laden's actual goal was \"to lure the United States into Afghanistan, which had long been called 'The Graveyard of Empires.'\"\n\nIn May 1998, a villa in Nairobi was purchased by one of the bombers to enable a bomb to be built in the garage. Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan purchased a beige Toyota Dyna truck in Nairobi and a 1987 Nissan Atlas refrigeration truck in Dar es Salaam. Six metal bars were used to form a \"cage\" on the back of the Atlas to accommodate the bomb.\n\nIn June 1998, KK Mohamed rented House 213 in the Illala district of Dar es Salaam, about four miles (6\u00a0km) from the U.S. embassy. A white Suzuki Samurai was used to haul bomb components hidden in rice sacks, to House 213.\n\nIn both Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Mohammed Odeh supervised construction of two very large,  destructive devices. The Nairobi bomb was made of 400 to 500 cylinders of TNT (about the size of drink cans), ammonium nitrate, aluminium powder and detonating cord. The explosives were packed into twenty specially designed wooden crates that were sealed and then placed in the bed of the trucks. Mushin Musa Matwalli Atwah ran a wire from the bomb to a set of batteries in the back of the truck cab and then to a detonator switch beneath the dashboard. The Dar es Salaam bomb was of slightly different construction: the TNT was attached to fifteen oxygen tanks and gas canisters, and was surrounded with four bags of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and some sand bags to tamp and direct the blast.\n\nThe bombings were scheduled for August 7, the eighth anniversary of the arrival of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia during the early stages of the Persian Gulf War, likely a choice by Osama bin Laden.\n\n==Attacks and casualties==\n\nOn August 7 between 10:30\u00a0a.m. and 10:40\u00a0a.m. local time (3:30\u20133:40\u00a0a.m. EDT), suicide bombers in trucks laden with explosives parked outside the embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi, and almost simultaneously detonated. 213 people were killed in the Nairobi blast, while 11 were killed in Dar es Salaam. An estimated 4,000 in Nairobi were wounded, and another 85 in Dar es Salaam. Seismological readings analyzed after the bombs indicated energy of between  of high explosive material. Although the attacks were directed at U.S. facilities, the vast majority of casualties were local citizens of the two African countries. 12 Americans were killed, including two Central Intelligence Agency employees in the Nairobi embassy, Tom Shah (aka Uttamilal Thomas Shah) and Molly Huckaby Hardy, and one U.S. Marine, Sergeant Jesse Aliganga (aka Nathan Aliganga), a Marine Security Guard at the Nairobi embassy. U.S. Army Sergeant Kenneth Ray Hobson II was one of the 12 Americans killed in the attack.\n\nWhile Azzam drove the Toyota Dyna quickly toward the Nairobi embassy along with Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-Owhali, local security guard Benson Okuku Bwaku was warned to open the gate immediately \u2013 and fired upon when he refused to comply. Al-Owhali threw a stun grenade at embassy guards before exiting the vehicle and running off. Osama bin Laden later offered the explanation that it had been Al-Owhali's intention to leap out and shoot the guards to clear a path for the truck, but that he had left his pistol in the truck and subsequently ran off. As Bwaku radioed to Marine Post One for backup, the truck detonated.\n\nThe explosion damaged the embassy building and collapsed the neighboring Ufundi Building where most victims were killed, mainly students and staff of a secretarial college housed here. The heat from the blast was channelled between the buildings towards Haile Selassie Avenue where a packed commuter bus was burned. Windows were shattered in a radius of nearly . A large number of eye injuries occurred because people in buildings nearby who had heard the first explosion of the hand grenade and the shooting went to their office windows to have a look when the main blast occurred and shattered the windows.\n\nMeanwhile, the Atlas truck that attacked the US Embassy at 36 Laibon Road, Dar es Salaam was being driven by Hamden Khalif Allah Awad, known as \"Ahmed the German\" due to his blond hair, a former camp trainer who had arrived in the country only a few days earlier. The death toll was less than in Nairobi as the U.S. embassy was located outside the city center in the upscale Oysterbay neighborhood, and a water truck prevented the suicide bombers from getting closer to the structure.\n\nFollowing the attacks, a group calling itself the \"Liberation Army for Holy Sites\" took credit for the bombings. U.S. investigators believe the term was a cover used by Egyptian Islamic Jihad, who had actually perpetrated the bombing.\n\n==Aftermath and international response==\n\n\nIn response to the bombings, President Bill Clinton ordered Operation Infinite Reach, a series of cruise missile strikes on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan on August 20, 1998, announcing the planned strike in a prime time address on U.S. television.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1189 condemning the attacks on the embassies.\n\nBoth embassies were heavily damaged and the Nairobi embassy had to be rebuilt. It is now located across the road from the United Nations Office at Nairobi for security purposes.\n\nA memorial park was constructed on the former embassy site, dedicated on the third anniversary of the attack. Public protest marred the opening ceremony after it was announced that the park, including its wall inscribed with the names of the dead, would not be free to the public. , the park continues to charge an entrance fee.\n\nWithin months following the bombings, the United States Department of State Bureau of Diplomatic Security added Kenya to its Antiterrorism Assistance Program (ATA), which was originally created in 1983. While the addition was largely a formality to reaffirm U.S. commitment to fighting terrorism in Kenya, it nonetheless sparked the beginning of an active bilateral antiterrorism campaign between the United States and Kenya. The U.S. government also rapidly and permanently increased the monetary aid to Kenya. Immediate changes included a $42 million grant targeted specifically towards Kenyan victims.\n\n\nIn 2001, lead plaintiff James Owens and others filed a civil lawsuit against Sudan, for its role in the attack, under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act with the recently-added 1996 amendments for state-sponsored terrorism.  They argued that Sudan was at fault for providing sanctuary to the bombers, prior to the attack. The lawsuit was prolonged over a decade, hampered in part by the lack of Sudan sending counsel at times, but further struggled when the legal system ruled that foreign nations had sovereign immunity from cause of action in civil lawsuits based on the current language of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act in a 2004 case. Congress amended the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act in 2008 to correct this and to allow its provisions to retroactively apply to existing lawsuits, including Owens' case. With that, hundreds more plaintiffs joined the suit, eventually with more than 700 parties listed. By 2014, the district court awarded the plaintiffs over $10 billion.  Sudan, which had not appeared during the initial lawsuit, appealed the judgment, arguing it did not understand the US civil suit system, and did not understand the consequences of not appearing, but also challenged the retroactive nature of the 2008 change to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.  The appeals court discounted Sudan's  argument regarding its lack of understand, and still upheld them liable for the bombings, but ruled that the $4.3 billion of punitive damages were not allowed to be applied retroactively. The plainiffs petitioned to the Supreme Court to appeal, and in May 2020, the Court ruled in Opati v. Republic of Sudan that the punative damages could be retroactively applied, restoring the $4.3 billion that had been awarded at the District Court.\n\n==Indictment==\n\n\n\nFollowing the investigation, an indictment was issued. It charges the following 21 people for various alleged roles in the bombings. 18 of the cases have been settled.\n\n\n\n==See also==\n\n* Terrorism in Kenya\n* 1998 World Cup terror

{"title":"1983 Beirut barracks bombings","article":"On October 23, 1983, two truck bombs struck buildings in Beirut, Lebanon, housing American and French service members of the Multinational Force in Lebanon (MNF), a military peacekeeping operation during the Lebanese Civil War. The attack killed 307 people: 241 U.S. and 58 French military personnel, six civilians, and two attackers.\n\nThe first suicide bomber detonated a truck bomb at the building serving as a barracks for the 1st Battalion 8th Marines (Battalion Landing Team \u2013 BLT 1\/8) of the 2nd Marine Division, killing 220 Marines, 18 sailors and 3 soldiers, making this incident the deadliest single-day death toll for the United States Marine Corps since the Battle of Iwo Jima in World War II and the deadliest single-day death toll for the United States Armed Forces since the first day of the Tet Offensive in the Vietnam War. Another 128 Americans were wounded in the blast; 13 later died of their injuries, and they are counted among the number who died. An elderly Lebanese man, a custodian\/vendor who was known to work and sleep in his concession stand next to the building, was also killed in the first blast. The explosives used were later estimated to be equivalent to as much as 9,500\u00a0kg (21,000\u00a0pounds) of TNT.\n\nMinutes later, a second suicide bomber struck the nine-story Drakkar building, a few kilometers away, where the French contingent was stationed; 55 paratroopers from the 1st Parachute Chasseur Regiment and three paratroopers of the 9th Parachute Chasseur Regiment were killed and 15 injured. It was the single worst French military loss since the end of the Algerian War. The wife and four children of a Lebanese janitor at the French building were also killed, and more than twenty other Lebanese civilians were injured.\n\nA group called Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the bombings and said that the aim was to force the MNF out of Lebanon. According to Caspar Weinberger, then United States Secretary of Defense, there is no knowledge of who did the bombing. Some analysis highlights the role of Hezbollah and Iran, calling it \"an Iranian operation from top to bottom\". There is no consensus on whether Hezbollah existed at the time of bombing.\n\nThe attacks eventually led to the withdrawal of the international peacekeeping force from Lebanon, where they had been stationed following the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) withdrawal in the aftermath of Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.\n\nIn 2004 it was reported that an Iranian group called the Committee for the Commemoration of Martyrs of the Global Islamic Campaign had erected a monument, at the Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery in Tehran, to commemorate the 1983 bombings and its \"martyrs\".\n\n==Beirut: June 1982 to October 1983==\n\n===Timeline===\n:6 June 1982 \u2013 Israel undertook military action in Southern Lebanon: Operation \"Peace for Galilee.\"\n:\n:23 August 1982 \u2013 Bachir Gemayel was elected to be Lebanon's president.\n:\n:25 August 1982 \u2013 A MNF of approximately 400 French, 800 Italian soldiers and 800 Marines of the 32d Marine Amphibious Unit (MAU) were deployed in Beirut as part of a peacekeeping force to oversee the evacuation of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) guerrillas.\n:\n:10 September 1982 \u2013 The PLO retreats from Beirut under MNF protection. Subsequently, the 32d MAU was ordered out of Beirut by the President of the United States.\n:\n:14 September 1982 \u2013 Lebanon's President, Bachir Gemayel, was assassinated.\n:\n:16 September to 18 September 1982 \u2013 The Sabra and Shatila massacre occurred.\n:\n:21 September 1982 \u2013 Bachir Gemayel's brother, Amine Gemayel, was elected to be Lebanon's president.\n:\n:29 September 1982 \u2013 The 32d MAU was redeployed to Beirut (primarily at the BIA) rejoining 2,200 French and Italian MNF troops already in place.\n:\n:30 October 1982 \u2013 The 32d MAU was relieved by the 24th MAU.\n:\n:15 February 1983 \u2013 The 32d MAU, redesignated as the 22d MAU, returned to Lebanon to relieve the 24th MAU.\n:\n:18 April 1983 \u2013 The U.S. Embassy bombing in Beirut killed 63, of whom 17 were Americans.\n:\n:17 May 1983 \u2013 The May 17 Agreement was signed.\n:\n:30 May 1983 \u2013 The 24th MAU relieved the 22d MAU.\n\n\n\n===Mission===\nOn June 6, 1982, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) initiated Operation \"Peace for Galilee\" and invaded Lebanon in order to create a 40\u00a0km buffer zone between the PLO and Syrian forces in Lebanon and Israel. The Israeli invasion was tacitly approved by the U.S., and the U.S. provided overt military support to Israel in the form of arms and materiel. The U.S.' support for Israel's invasion of Lebanon taken in conjunction with U.S. support for Lebanese President Bachir Gemayel and the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) alienated many. Bachir Gemayel was the legally elected president, but he was a partisan Maronite Christian and covert associate of Israel. These factors served to disaffect the Lebanese Muslim and Druze communities. This animosity was made worse by the Phalangist, a right-wing, largely Maronite-Lebanese militia force closely associated with President Gemayel. The Phalangist militia was responsible for multiple, bloody attacks against the Muslim and Druze communities in Lebanon and for the 1982 atrocities committed in the PLO refugee camps, Sabra and Shatila by Lebanese Forces (LF), while the IDF provided security and looked on. The Phalangist militia's attacks on Sabra and Shatila were purportedly a response to the September 14, 1982, assassination of President-elect Bachir Gemayel. Amine Gemayel, Bachir's brother, succeeded Bachir as the elected president of Lebanon, and Amine continued to represent and advance Maronite interests.\n\nAll of this, according to British foreign correspondent Robert Fisk, served to generate ill will against the MNF among Lebanese Muslims and especially among the Shiites living in the slums of West Beirut. Lebanese Muslims believed the MNF, and the Americans in particular, were unfairly siding with the Maronite Christians in their attempt to dominate Lebanon. As a result, this led to artillery, mortar, and small arms fire being directed at MNF peacekeepers by Muslim factions. Operating under the peacetime rules of engagement, MNF peacekeepers \u2013 primarily U.S. and French forces \u2013 used minimum use of force as possible in order to avoid compromising their neutral status. Until October 23, 1983, there were ten guidelines issued for each U.S. Marine member of the MNF:\n\n# When on post, mobile or foot patrol, keep loaded magazine in weapon, bolt closed, weapon on safe, no round in the chamber.\n# Do not chamber a round unless instructed to do so by a commissioned officer unless you must act in immediate self-defense where deadly force is authorized.\n# Keep ammo for crew-served weapons readily available but not loaded in the weapon. Weapons will be on safe at all times.\n# Call local forces to assist in self-defense effort. Notify headquarters.\n# Use only minimum degree of force to accomplish any mission.\n# Stop the use of force when it is no longer needed to accomplish the mission.\n# If you receive effective hostile fire, direct your fire at the source. If possible, use friendly snipers.\n# Respect civilian property; do not attack it unless absolutely necessary to protect friendly forces.\n# Protect innocent civilians from harm.\n# Respect and protect recognized medical agencies such as Red Cross, Red Crescent, etc.\n\nThe perimeter guards at the U.S. Marine headquarters on the morning of October 23, 1983, were in full compliance with rules 1\u20133 and were unable to shoot fast enough to disable or stop the bomber (see The bombings: Sunday, October 23, 1983 below).\n\nIn 1982, the Islamic Republic of Iran established a base in the Syrian-controlled Beqaa Valley in Lebanon. From that base, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) \"founded, financed, trained and equipped Hezbollah to operate as a proxy army\" for Iran. Some analysts believe the newly formed Islamic Republic of Iran was heavily involved in the bomb attacks and that a major factor leading it to orchestrate the attacks on the barracks was America's support for Iraq in the Iran\u2013Iraq War and its extending of $2.5 billion in trade credit to Iraq while halting the shipments of arms to Iran. A few weeks before the bombing, Iran warned that providing armaments to Iran's enemies would provoke retaliatory punishment. On September 26, 1983, \"the National Security Agency (NSA) intercepted an Iranian diplomatic communications message from the Iranian intelligence agency, the Ministry of Information and Security (MOIS),\" to its ambassador, Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, in Damascus. The message directed the ambassador to \"take spectacular action against the American Marines.\" The intercepted message, dated September 26, would not be passed to the Marines until October 26: three days after the bombing.\n\nMuch of what is now public knowledge of Iranian involvement, e.g., PETN purportedly supplied by Iran, the suicide bomber's name and nationality, etc., in the bombings was not revealed to the public until the 2003 trial, Peterson, et al v. Islamic Republic, et al. Testimony by Admiral James \"Ace\" Lyon's, U.S.N. (Ret), and FBI forensic explosive investigator Danny A. Defenbaugh, plus a deposition by a Hezbollah operative named Mahmoud (a pseudonym) were particularly revealing.\n\n====Incidents====\nOn July 14, 1983, a Lebanese Armed Forces patrol was ambushed by Lebanese Druze militia elements and from July 15\u201317, Lebanese troops engaged the Shia Amal militia in Beirut over a dispute involving the eviction of Shiite squatters from a schoolhouse. At the same time, fighting in the Shuf between the LAF and Druze militia escalated sharply. On July 22, Beirut International Airport (BIA), the headquarters of the U.S. 24th Marine Amphibious Unit (24th MAU), was shelled with Druze mortar and artillery fire, wounding three U.S. Marines and causing the temporary closure of the airport.\n\nOn July 23, Walid Jumblatt, leader of the predominantly Druze Progressive Socialist Party (PSP), announced the formation of a Syrian-backed \"National Salvation Front\" opposed to the May 17 Agreement. In anticipation of an IDF withdrawal from the Alayh and Shuf districts, fighting between the Druze and LF and between the Druze and LAF, intensified during the month of August. Druze artillery closed the BIA between 10 and 16 August, and the Druze made explicit their opposition to LAF deployment in the Shuf. The LAF also clashed with the Amal militia in Beirut's western and southern suburbs.\n\nAs the security situation deteriorated, US positions at BIA were subjected to increased fire. On August 10 and 11, an estimated thirty-five rounds of mortar and rocket fire landed on US positions, wounding one Marine. On August 28, in response to constant mortar and rocket fire upon US positions, US peacekeepers returned fire for the first time. On the following day, US artillery silenced a Druze battery after two Marines were killed in a mortar attack. On August 31, the LAF swept through the Shia neighborhood of West Beirut, establishing temporary control over the area.\n\nOn September 4, the IDF withdrew from the Alayh and Shuf Districts, falling back to the Awwali River. The LAF was not prepared to fill the void, moving instead to occupy the key junction at Khaldah, south of BIA. That same day, BIA was again shelled, killing two Marines and wounding two others. No retaliation was given due to the ROE. As the LAF moved slowly eastward into the foothills of the Shuf, accounts of massacres, conducted by Christians and Druze alike, began to be reported. On September 5, a Druze force, reportedly reinforced by PLO elements, routed the Christian LF militia at Bhamdun and all but eliminated the LF as a military factor in the Alayh District. This defeat obliged the LAF to occupy Souk El Gharb to avoid conceding all of the high ground overlooking BIA to the Druze. U.S. positions were again subjected to constant indirect fire attacks; consequently, counterbattery fire based on target acquisition radar data was employed. F-14 tactical airborne reconnaissance (TARPS) missions were conducted for the first time on September 7. On September 8, naval gunfire from offshore destroyers was employed for the first time in defense of the U.S. Marines.\n\nOn September 25, a ceasefire was instituted that same day and Beirut International Airport reopened five days later. On October 1, Walid Jumblatt announced a separate governmental administration for the Shuf and called for the mass defection of all Druze elements from the LAF. Nevertheless, on 14 October the leaders of Lebanon's key factions agreed to conduct reconciliation talks in Geneva, Switzerland. Although the ceasefire officially held into mid-October, factional clashes intensified and sniper attacks on MNF contingents became commonplace. On October 19, four Marines were wounded when a US convoy was attacked by a remotely detonated car bomb parked along the convoy route.\n\n==Bombings: Sunday, October 23, 1983==\n\n\n\n\nAt around 06:22, a 19-ton yellow Mercedes-Benz stake-bed truck drove to the Beirut International Airport. The 1st Battalion 8th Marines (BLT), commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Larry Gerlach, was a subordinate element of the 24th MAU. The truck was not the water truck they had been expecting. Instead, it was a hijacked truck carrying explosives. The driver turned his truck onto an access road leading to the compound. He drove into and circled the parking lot, and then he accelerated to crash through a 5-foot-high barrier of concertina wire separating the parking lot from the building. The wire popped \"like somebody walking on twigs.\" The truck then passed between two sentry posts and through an open vehicle gate in the perimeter chain-link fence, crashed through a guard shack in front of the building and smashed into the lobby of the building serving as the barracks for the 1st Battalion 8th Marines (BLT). The sentries at the gate were operating under rules of engagement which made it very difficult to respond quickly to the truck. On the day of the bombing, the sentries were ordered to keep a loaded magazine inserted in their weapon, bolt closed, weapon on safe and no round in the chamber. Only one sentry, LCpl Eddie DiFranco, was able to chamber a round. However, by that time the truck was already crashing into the building's entryway.\n\n\nThe suicide bomber, an Iranian national named Ismail Ascari, detonated his explosives, which were later estimated to be equivalent to approximately 9,525 kilograms (21,000 pounds) of TNT. The force of the explosion collapsed the four-story building into rubble, crushing to death 241 American servicemen. According to Eric Hammel in his history of the U.S. Marine landing force,\n:The force of the explosion initially lifted the entire four-story structure, shearing the bases of the concrete support columns, each measuring fifteen feet in circumference and reinforced by numerous one-and-three-quarter-inch steel rods. The airborne building then fell in upon itself. A massive shock wave and ball of flaming gas was hurled in all directions.\n\nThe explosive mechanism was a gas-enhanced device consisting of compressed butane in canisters employed with pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) to create a fuel-air explosive. The bomb was carried on a layer of concrete covered with a slab of marble to direct the blast upward. Despite the lack of sophistication and wide availability of its component parts, a gas-enhanced device can be a lethal weapon. These devices were similar to fuel-air or thermobaric weapons, explaining the large blast and damage. An after-action forensic investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) determined that the bomb was so powerful that it probably would have brought down the building even if the sentries had managed to stop the truck between the gate and the building.\n\nLess than ten minutes later, a similar attack occurred against the barracks of the French 3rd Company of the 1st Parachute Chasseur Regiment, 6\u00a0km away in the Ramlet al Baida area of West Beirut. As the suicide bomber drove his pickup truck toward the \"Drakkar\" building, French paratroopers began shooting at the truck and its driver. It is believed that the driver was killed and the truck was immobilized and rolled to stop about fifteen yards from the building. A few moments passed before the truck exploded, bringing down the nine-story building and killing 58 French paratroopers. It is believed that this bomb was detonated by remote control and that, though similarly constructed, it was smaller than and slightly less than half as powerful as the one used against the Marines at the Beirut International Airport. Many of the paratroopers had gathered on their balconies moments earlier to see what was happening at the airport. It was France's worst military loss since the end of the Algerian War in 1962.\n\n==Rescue and recovery operations: October 23 to 28, 1983==\n\n===American===\n\n\nOrganized rescue efforts began immediately \u2013 within three minutes of the bombing \u2013 and continued for days. Unit maintenance personnel were not billeted in the BLT building, and they rounded up pry bars, torches, jacks and other equipment from unit vehicles and maintenance shops and began rescue operations. Meanwhile, combat engineers and truck drivers began using their organic assets, i.e., trucks and engineering equipment, to help with the rescue operations. 24th MAU medical personnel, Navy dentists LT Gil Bigelow and LT Jim Ware, established two aid stations to triage and treat casualties. Medevac helicopters, CH-46s from Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron (HMM-162), were airborne by 6:45 AM. U.S. Navy medical personnel from nearby vessels of the U.S. Sixth Fleet went ashore to assist with treatment and medical evacuation of the injured, as did sailors and shipboard Marines who volunteered to assist with the rescue effort. Lebanese, Italian, British, and even French troops, who had suffered their own loss, provided assistance.\n\nMany Lebanese civilians voluntarily joined the rescue effort. Especially important was a Lebanese construction contractor, Rafiq Hariri of the firm Oger-Liban, who provided heavy construction equipment, e.g., a 40-ton P & H crane, etc., from nearby BIA worksites. Hariri's construction equipment proved vitally necessary in lifting and removing heavy slabs of concrete debris at the barracks site just as it had been necessary in assisting with clearing debris after the April U.S. Embassy attack.\n\n\nWhile the rescuers were at times hindered by hostile sniper and artillery fire, several Marine survivors were pulled from the rubble at the BLT 1\/8 bomb site and airlifted by helicopter to the , located offshore. U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force and Royal Air Force medevac planes transported the seriously wounded to the hospital at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus and to U.S. and German hospitals in West Germany. A few survivors, including Lt. Col. Gerlach, were sent to the Italian MNF dispensary and to Lebanese hospitals in Beirut. Israel's offers to medevac the wounded to hospitals in Israel were rejected as politically unacceptable even though Israeli hospitals were known to provide excellent care and were considerably closer than hospitals in Germany.\n\nAt about noon Sunday, October 23, the last survivor was pulled from the rubble; he was LTJG Danny G. Wheeler, Lutheran chaplain for BLT 1\/8. Other men survived beyond Sunday, but they succumbed to their injuries before they could be extracted from the rubble. By Wednesday, the majority of the bodies and body parts had been recovered from the stricken barracks, and the recovery effort ended on Friday. After five days, the FBI came in to investigate, and the Marines returned to normal duties.\n\n===French===\n\"The explosion at the French barracks blew the whole building off its foundations and threw it about 6 meters (20 feet) westward, while breaking the windows of almost every apartment house in the neighborhood .... Grim-faced French paratroopers and Lebanese civil-defense workers aided by bulldozers also worked under spotlights through the night at the French barracks, trying to pull apart the eight stories of 90 centimeter (3 foot) thick cement that had fallen on top of one another and to reach the men they could still hear screaming for help. They regularly pumped oxygen into the mountain of rubble to keep those who were still trapped below alive.\"\n\n== Victims ==\nThe explosions resulted in 346 casualties, of which 234 (68%) were killed immediately, with head injuries, thoracic injuries and burns accounting for a large number of deaths.\n\nThe New York Times printed a list of the identified casualties on October 26, 1983. Another list of those who survived the incident was published by the Department of Defense. The information had to be re-printed, as individuals were misidentified, and family members were told incorrect statuses of their loved ones.\n\nTwenty-one U.S. peacekeepers who lost their lives in the bombing were buried in Section 59 at Arlington National Cemetery, near one of the memorials to all the victims.\n\n==American and French response==\n\n\nU.S. President Ronald Reagan called the attack a \"despicable act\" and pledged to keep a military force in Lebanon. U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who had privately advised the administration against stationing U.S. Marines in Lebanon, said there would be no change in the U.S.'s Lebanon policy. French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and other French dignitaries visited both the French and American bomb sites to offer their personal condolences on Monday, October 24, 1983. It was not an official visit, and President Mitterrand only stayed for a few hours, but he did declare \"We will stay.\" During his visit, President Mitterrand visited each of the scores of American caskets and made the sign of the cross as his mark of respectful observance for each of the fallen peacekeepers. U.S. Vice President George H. W. Bush arrived and made a tour of the destroyed BLT barracks on Wednesday, October 26, 1983. Vice President Bush toured the site and said the U.S. \"would not be cowed by terrorists.\" Vice President Bush also visited with wounded U.S. personnel aboard the U.S.S. Iwo Jima (LPH-2), and he took time to meet with the commanders of the other MNF units (French, Italian and British) deployed in Beirut.\n\nIn retaliation for the attacks, France launched an airstrike in the Beqaa Valley against alleged Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) positions. President Reagan assembled his national security team and planned to target the Sheik Abdullah barracks in Baalbek, Lebanon, which housed Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) believed to be training Hezbollah militants. A joint American\u2013French air assault on the camp where the bombing was planned was also approved by Reagan and Mitterrand. U.S. Defense Secretary Weinberger lobbied successfully against the mission, because at the time it was not certain that Iran was behind the attack.\n\nSome of the U.S. Marines in Beirut were moved to transport vessels offshore where they could not be targeted; yet, they would be ready and available to serve as a ready reaction force in Beirut if needed. For protection against snipers and artillery attacks, the Marines remaining at the airport built, and moved into, bunkers in the ground employing 'appropriated' Soviet-bloc CONEXes.\n\n\nCol Geraghty requested and received reinforcements to replace his unit losses. BLT 2\/6, the Second Marine Division Air Alert Battalion stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and commanded by  Col. Edwin C. Kelley, Jr., was dispatched and flown into Beirut by four C-141s in less than 36 hours after the bombing. Lt. Col. Kelley officially replaced the seriously injured BLT 1\/8 commander, Lt. Col. Larry Gerlach. The entire Headquarters and Service Company and Weapons Company of BLT 2\/6 was airlifted into Beirut, along with Company E (Reinforced). Lt. Col. Kelley quietly redesignated his unit, BLT 2\/6, as BLT 1\/8 to help bolster the morale of the BLT 1\/8 survivors. The BLT headquarters was relocated to a landfill area west of the airfield, and Company A (Reinforced) was repositioned from the university library position to serve as landing force reserve afloat, aboard Amphibious Ready Group shipping. On November 18, 1983, the 22d MAU rotated into Beirut and relieved in place the 24th MAU. The 24th MAU with Lt. Col. Kelley commanding BLT 1\/8 returned to Camp Lejeune, NC, by sea for training and refitting.\n\nEventually, it became evident that the U.S. would launch no serious and immediate retaliatory attack for the Beirut Marine barracks bombing beyond naval barrages and air strikes used to interdict continuous harassing fire from Druze and Syrian missile and artillery sites. A true retaliatory strike failed to materialize because there was a rift in White House counsel (largely between George P. Shultz of the Department of State and Weinberger of the Department of Defense) and because the extant evidence pointing at Iranian involvement was circumstantial at that time: the Islamic Jihad, which took credit for the attack, was a front for Hezbollah which was acting as a proxy for Iran; thus, affording Iran plausible deniability. Secretary of State Schultz was an advocate for retaliation, but Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger was against retaliation. Secretary of Defense Weinberger, in a September 2001 Frontline interview, reaffirmed that rift in White House counsel when he claimed that the U.S. still lacks \"'actual knowledge of who did the bombing' of the Marine barracks.\"\n\nThe  had arrived and taken up station off Beirut on September 25, 1983. Special Representative in the Middle East Robert McFarlane's team had requested New Jersey after the August 29th Druze mortar attack that killed two Marines. After the October 23rd bombing, on November 28, the U.S. government announced that the New Jersey would remain stationed off Beirut although her crew would be rotated. It was not until December 14 that New Jersey finally joined the fray and fired 11 projectiles from her 16-inch guns at hostile targets near Beirut. \"This was the first time 16-inch shells were fired for effect anywhere in the world since the New Jersey ended her time on the gunline in Vietnam in 1969.\" Also in December 1983, U.S. aircraft from the  and  battle groups attacked Syrian targets in Lebanon, but this was ostensibly in response to Syrian missile attacks on American warplanes.\n\nIn the meantime, the attack boosted the prestige and growth of the Shi'ite organization Hezbollah. Hezbollah officially denied any involvement in the attacks, but was seen by many Lebanese as involved nonetheless as it praised the \"two martyr mujahideen\" who \"set out to inflict upon the U.S. Administration an utter defeat, not experienced since Vietnam.\" Hezbollah was now seen by many as \"the spearhead of the sacred Muslim struggle against foreign occupation\".\n\nThe 1983 report of the U.S. Department of Defense Commission's on the attack recommended that the National Security Council investigate and consider alternative ways to reach \"American objectives in Lebanon\" because, \"as progress to diplomatic solutions slows,\" the security of the USMNF base continues to \"deteriorate.\" The commission also recommended a review for the development of a broader range of \"appropriate military, political, and diplomatic responses to terrorism.\" Military preparedness needed improvement in the development of \"doctrine, planning, organization, force structure, education, and training\" to better combat terrorism, while the USMNF was \"not prepared\" to deal with the terrorist threat at the time due to \"lack of training, staff, organization, and support\" specifically for defending against \"terror threats.\"\n\nAmal Movement leader Nabih Berri, who had previously supported U.S. mediation efforts, asked the U.S. and France to leave Lebanon and accused the two countries of seeking to commit 'massacres' against the Lebanese and of creating a \"climate of racism\" against Shias. Islamic Jihad phoned in new threats against the MNF pledging that \"the earth would tremble\" unless the MNF withdrew by New Year's Day 1984.\n\n\nOn February 7, 1984, President Reagan ordered the Marines to begin withdrawing from Lebanon largely because of waning congressional support for the mission after the attacks on the barracks. The withdrawal of the 22d MAU from the BIA was completed 12:37 PM on February 26, 1984. \"Fighting between the Lebanese Army and Druze militia in the nearby Shouf mountains provided a noisy backdrop to the Marine evacuation. One officer commented: 'This ceasefire is getting louder.'\"\n\nOn February 8, 1984, the USS New Jersey fired almost 300 shells at Druze and Syrian positions in the Beqaa Valley east of Beirut. This was the heaviest shore bombardment since the Korean War. Firing without air spotting, the battleship had to rely on Israeli target intelligence. \"In a nine-hour period, the USS New Jersey fired 288 16-inch rounds, each one weighing as much as a Volkswagen Beetle. In those nine-hours, the ship consumed 40 percent of the 16-inch ammunition available in the entire European theater ... [and] in one burst of wretched excess,\" New Jersey seemed to be unleashing eighteen months of repressed fury.\n\n\"Many Lebanese still recall the 'flying Volkswagens,' the name given to the huge shells that struck the Shouf.\" In addition to destroying Syrian and Druze artillery and missile sites, approximately 30 of these behemoth projectiles rained down on a Syrian command post, killing the senior commanding Syrian general in Lebanon along with several of his senior officers. Some of New Jerseys shells missed their intended targets and killed non-combatants, mostly Shiites and Druze.\n\nFollowing the lead of the U.S., the rest of the multinational force, the British, French and Italians, was withdrawn by the end of February 1984. The ship-borne 22d MAU contingent remained stationed offshore near Beirut while a detached 100-man ready reaction force remained stationed ashore near the U.S.\/U.K. Embassy. The 22d MAU was relieved in place by the 24th MAU on April 10, 1984. On April 21, the ready reaction force in Beirut was deactivated and its men were reassigned to their respective ships. In late July 1984, the last Marines from the 24th MAU, the U.S.\/U.K. Embassy guard detail, was withdrawn from Beirut.\n\t\nAlthough the withdrawal of U.S. and French peacekeepers from Lebanon following the bombings has been widely cited as demonstrative of the efficacy of terrorism, Max Abrahms observes that the bombings targeted military personnel and as such are not consistent with the most widely accepted attempts to define terrorism, which emphasize deliberate violence against civilians. A 2019 study disputes that the bombings motivated the withdrawal of U.S. forces, arguing instead that the collapse of the Lebanese national army in February 1984 was the primary motivating factor behind the withdrawal.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Search for perpetrators===\nAt the time of the bombing, an obscure group called the \"Islamic Jihad\" claimed responsibility for the attack. There were many in the U.S. government, such as Vice President Bush, Secretary of State George Shultz, and National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane (who was formerly Reagan's Mideast envoy), who believed Iran and\/or Syria were\/was responsible for the bombings. After some years of investigation, the U.S. government now believes that elements of what would eventually become Hezbollah, backed by Iran and Syria, were responsible for these bombings as well as the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut earlier in April. It is believed that Hezbollah used the name \"Islamic Jihad\" to remain anonymous. Hezbollah eventually announced its existence in 1985. This is while, according to President Reagan's Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger \"We still do not have the actual knowledge of who did the bombing of the Marine barracks at the Beirut Airport, and we certainly didn't then\". Weinberger mentions lack of certainty about Syria or Iran's involvement as the reason why America did not take any retaliatory actions against those states. Hezbollah, Iran and Syria have continued to deny any involvement in any of the bombings. An Iranian group erected a monument in a cemetery in Tehran to commemorate the 1983 bombings and its \"martyrs\" in 2004. Lebanese author Hala Jaber claims that Iran and Syria helped organize the bombing which was run by two Lebanese Shia, Imad Mughniyah and Mustafa Badr Al Din:\n\nImad Mughniyeh and Mustafa Badr Al Din took charge of the Syrian\u2013Iranian backed operation. Mughniyeh had been a highly trained security man with the PLO's Force 17 . . . Their mission was to gather information and details about the American embassy and draw up a plan that would guarantee the maximum impact and leave no trace of the perpetrator. Meetings were held at the Iranian embassy in Damascus. They were usually chaired by the ambassador, Hojatoleslam Ali-Akbar Mohtashemi, who played an instrumental role in founding Hezbollah. In consultation with several senior Syrian intelligence officers, the final plan was set in motion. The vehicle and explosives were prepared in the Beqaa Valley which was under Syrian control.\n\nTwo years after the bombing, a U.S. grand jury secretly indicted Imad Mughniyah for terrorist activities. Mughniyah was never captured, but he was killed by a car bomb in Syria on February 12, 2008.\n\nCommentators argue that the lack of a response by the Americans emboldened terrorist organizations to conduct further attacks against U.S. targets. Along with the U.S. embassy bombing, the barracks bombing prompted the Inman Report, a review of the security of U.S. facilities overseas for the U.S. State Department.\n\n===Alleged retaliation===\n\n\nOn March 8, 1985, a truck bomb blew up in Beirut killing more than 80 people and injuring more than 200. The bomb detonated near the apartment block of Sheikh Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, a Shia cleric thought by many to be the spiritual leader of Hezbollah. Although the U.S. did not engage in any direct military retaliation to the attack on the Beirut barracks, the 1985 bombing was widely believed by Fadlallah and his supporters to be the work of the United States; Sheikh Fadlallah stating that \"'They sent me a letter and I got the message,' and an enormous sign on the remains of one bombed building read: 'Made in the U.S.A.'\" Robert Fisk also claims that CIA operatives planted the bomb and that evidence of this is found in an article in The Washington Post newspaper. Journalist Robin Wright quotes articles in The Washington Post and The New York Times as saying that according to the CIA the \"Lebanese intelligence personnel and other foreigners had been undergoing CIA training\" but that \"this was not our [CIA] operation and it was nothing we planned or knew about.\" \"Alarmed U.S. officials subsequently canceled the covert training operation\" in Lebanon, according to Wright.\n\n===Lessons learned===\nShortly after the barracks bombing, President Ronald Reagan appointed a military fact-finding committee headed by retired Admiral Robert L. J. Long to investigate the bombing. The commission's report found senior military officials responsible for security lapses and blamed the military chain of command for the disaster. It suggested that there might have been many fewer deaths if the barracks guards had carried loaded weapons and a barrier more substantial than the barbed wire the bomber drove over easily. The commission also noted that the \"prevalent view\" among U.S. commanders was that there was a direct link between the navy shelling of the Muslims at Suq-al-Garb and the truck bomb attack.\n\nFollowing the bombing and the realization that insurgents could deliver weapons of enormous yield with an ordinary truck or van, the presence of protective barriers (bollards) became common around critical government facilities in the United States and elsewhere, particularly Western civic targets situated overseas.\n\nA 2009 article in Foreign Policy titled \"Lesson Unlearned\" argues that the U.S. military intervention in the Lebanese Civil War has been downplayed or ignored in popular history \u2013 thus unlearned \u2013 and that lessons from Lebanon are \"unlearned\" as the U.S. militarily intervenes elsewhere in the world.\n\n===Civil suit against Iran===\n\nOn October 3 and December 28, 2001, the families of the 241 U.S. peacekeepers who were killed as well as several injured survivors filed civil suits against the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Ministry of Information and Security (MOIS) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. In their separate complaints, the families and survivors sought a judgment that Iran was responsible for the attack and relief in the form of damages (compensatory and punitive) for wrongful death and common-law claims for battery, assault, and intentional infliction of emotional distress resulting from an act of state-sponsored terrorism.\n\nIran (the defendant) was served with the two complaints (one from Deborah D. Peterson, Personal Representative of the Estate of James C. Knipple, et al., the other from Joseph and Marie Boulos, Personal Representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey Joseph Boulos) on May 6 and July 17, 2002. Iran denied responsibility for the attack but did not file any response to the claims of the families. On December 18, 2002, Judge Royce C. Lamberth entered defaults against defendants in both cases.\n\nOn May 30, 2003, Lamberth found Iran legally responsible for providing Hezbollah with financial and logistical support that helped them carry out the attack. Lamberth concluded that the court had personal jurisdiction over the defendants under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, that Hezbollah was formed under the auspices of the Iranian government and was completely reliant on Iran in 1983, and that Hezbollah carried out the attack in conjunction with MOIS agents.\n\nOn September 7, 2007, Lamberth awarded $2,656,944,877 to the plaintiffs. The judgment was divided up among the victims; the largest award was $12 million to Larry Gerlach, who became a paraplegic as a result of a broken neck he suffered in the attack.\n\nThe attorney for the families of the victims uncovered some new information, including a U.S. National Security Agency intercept of a message sent from Iranian intelligence headquarters in Tehran to Hojjat ol-eslam Ali-Akbar Mohtashemi, the Iranian ambassador in Damascus. As it was paraphrased by presiding U.S. District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth, \"The message directed the Iranian ambassador to contact Hussein Musawi, the leader of the terrorist group Islamic Amal, and to instruct him ... 'to take a spectacular action against the United States Marines.'\" Musawi's Islamic Amal was a breakaway faction of the Amal Movement and an autonomous part of embryonic Hezbollah. According to Muhammad Sahimi, high-ranking US officials had a different interpretation from that intercept, which stopped them from ordering a revengeful attack against Iran.\n\nIn July 2012, federal Judge Royce Lamberth ordered Iran to pay more than $813m in damages and interest to the families of the 241 U.S. peacekeepers that were killed, writing in a ruling that Tehran had to be \"punished to the fullest extent legally possible... Iran is racking up quite a bill from its sponsorship of terrorism.\" In April 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that frozen assets of Iran's Central Bank held in the U.S. could be used to pay the compensation to families of the victims.\n\n===Mossad conspiracy theory===\nFormer Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky, in his 1990 book By Way of Deception, has accused the Mossad of knowing the specific time and location of the bombing, but only gave general information to the Americans of the attack, information which was worthless. According to Ostrovsky, then Mossad head Nahum Admoni decided against giving the specific details to the Americans on the grounds that the Mossad's responsibility was to protect Israel's interests, not Americans. Admoni denied having any prior knowledge of the attack. Benny Morris, in his review of Ostrovsky's book, wrote that Ostrovsky was \"barely a case officer before he was fired; most of his (brief) time in the agency was spent as a trainee\" adding that due to compartmentalization \"he did not and could not have had much knowledge of then current Mossad operations, let alone operational history.\" Benny Morris wrote that the claim regarding the barracks was \"odd\" and an example of one of Ostrovsky's \"wet\" stories which were \"mostly fabricated.\"\n\n==Memorials and remembrance==\n\n\nA Beirut Memorial has been established at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, and has been used as the site of annual memorial services for the victims of the attack. A Beirut Memorial Room at the USO in Jacksonville, North Carolina has also been created.\n\nThe Armed Forces Chaplaincy Center, the site of Chaplain Corps training for the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force at Fort Jackson, Columbia, South Carolina, includes the partially destroyed sign from the Beirut barracks chapel as a memorial to those who died in the attack. According to Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff, one of the navy chaplains present during the attack, \"Amidst the rubble, we found the plywood board which we had made for our \"Peace-keeping Chapel.\" The Chaplain Corps Seal had been hand-painted, with the words \"Peace-keeping\" above it, and \"Chapel\" beneath. Now \"Peace-keeping\" was legible, but the bottom of the plaque was destroyed, with only a few burned and splintered pieces of wood remaining. The idea of peace \u2013 above; the reality of war \u2013 below.\"\n\n\nOther memorials to the victims of the Beirut barracks bombing have been erected in various locations within the U.S., including one at Penn's Landing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Boston Ma. and one in Florida. Additionally, a Lebanese cedar has been planted in Arlington National Cemetery near the graves of some of the victims of the attack, in their memory. A plaque in the ground in front of the tree, dedicated in a ceremony on the first anniversary of the attack, reads: \"Let peace take root: This cedar of Lebanon tree grows in living memory of the Americans killed in the Beirut terrorist attack and all victims of terrorism around the world.\"\n The National Museum of the Marine Corps, in Quantico, Virginia, unveiled an exhibit in 2008 in memory of the attack and its victims.\n\nOne memorial to the attack is located outside the U.S., where Gilla Gerzon, the director of the Haifa, Israel USO during the time of the attack coordinated the creation of a memorial park that included 241 olive trees, one for each of the U.S. military personnel who died in the attack. The trees lead to an overpass on Mount Carmel looking toward Beirut.\n\nThere is also an ongoing effort on the part of Beirut veterans and family members to convince the U.S. Postal Service and Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee to create a stamp in memory of the victims of the attack, but the recommendation has not yet been approved. In the meantime, Beirut veterans have created a \"PC Postage\" commercially produced Beirut Memorial statue private vendor stamp (with or without the words \"They Came in Peace\") that is approved for use as postage by the U.S. Postal Service.\n\n\n\n==See also==\n* Tyre headquarters bombings, similar attacks against Israeli military posts in Lebanon\n* 1984 United States embassy annex bombing\n* Khobar Towers Bombing\n* Mountain War\n* List of vehicle ramming terrorist attacks\n\n==Further reading==\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n==Notes==\n\n\n==References==\nhttps:\/\/www.npr.org\/2019\/05\/24\/725852841\/survivor-of-deadly-1983-beirut-bombing-we-don-t-talk-about-it-much\n\n\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n\n==External links==\n\n*  President Reagan reads Chaplain Arnold Resnicoff's first-hand account of bombing: Text Version; [\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/21\/Reagan_Speech_Beirut_Bombing.ogv Video Version];  Text of original report,\n*  Tribute to the French 3rd Parachute Company\n*  Lebanese civil war Full Information\n*  241.SaveTheSoldiers.com An Honorary Tribute to the soldiers who died\n*  Lebanese civil war 1983 Full of Pictures and Information\n*  John H.

{"title":"1983 United States embassy bombing in Beirut","article":"The April 18, 1983 United States embassy bombing was a suicide bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, that killed 32 Lebanese, 17 Americans, and 14 visitors and passers-by. The victims were mostly embassy and CIA staff members, but also included several US soldiers and one US Marine Security Guard. It was the deadliest attack on a US diplomatic mission up to that time, and was considered the beginning of Islamist attacks on US targets.\n\nThe attack came in the wake of an intervention in the Lebanese Civil War by the United States and other Western countries, which sought to restore order and central government authority.\n\n==Bombing==\n\nThe car bomb was detonated by a suicide bomber driving a van packed with nearly  of explosives at approximately 1:00\u00a0p.m. (GMT+2) April 18, 1983. The van, originally sold in Texas, bought used and shipped to the Gulf, gained access to the embassy compound and parked under the portico at the very front of the building, where it exploded. Former CIA operative Robert Baer's account says that the van broke through an outbuilding, crashed through the lobby door and exploded there. The blast collapsed the entire central facade of the horseshoe-shaped building, leaving the wreckage of balconies and offices in heaped tiers of rubble, and spewing masonry, metal and glass fragments in a wide swath. The explosion was heard throughout West Beirut and broke windows as far as a mile away. Rescue workers worked around the clock, unearthing the dead and wounded.\n\nRobert S. Dillon, then Ambassador to Lebanon, recounted the attack in his oral history:\nAll of a sudden, the window blew in. I was very lucky, because I had my arm and the T-shirt in front of my face, which protected me from the flying glass. I ended up flat on my back. I never heard the explosion. Others said that it was the loudest explosion they ever heard. It was heard from a long distance away.\n\nAs I lay on the floor on my back, the brick wall behind my desk blew out. Everything seemed to happen in slow motion. The wall fell on my legs; I could not feel them. I thought they were gone. The office filled with smoke, dust, and tear gas. What happened was that the blast first blew in the window and then traveled up an air shaft from the first floor to behind my desk. We had had tear gas canisters on the first floor. The blast set them off so that the air rush that came up through the shaft brought the tear gas with it and also collapsed the wall.\n\nWe didn't know what had happened. The central stairway was gone, but the building had another stairway, which we used to make our way down, picking our way through the rubble. We were astounded to see the damage below us. I didn't realize that the entire bay of the building below my office had been destroyed. I hadn't grasped that yet. I remember speculating that some people had undoubtedly been hurt. As we descended, we saw people hurt. Everybody had this funny white look because they were all covered with dust. They were staggering around.\n\nWe got to the second floor, still not fully cognizant of how bad it was, although I recognized that major damage had been done. With each second, the magnitude of the explosion became clearer. I saw Marylee MacIntyre standing; she couldn't see because her face had been cut and her eyes were full of blood. I picked her up and took her over to a window and gave her to someone. A minute later, someone came up to me and said that Bill MacIntyre was dead; he had just seen the body. That was the first time I realized that people had been killed. I didn't know how many, but I began to understand how bad the blast had been. \n\n==Death toll==\n\nA total of 63 people were killed in the bombing: 32 Lebanese employees, 17 Americans, and 14 visitors and passers-by. Of the Americans killed, eight worked for the Central Intelligence Agency, including the CIA's top Middle East analyst and Near East director, Robert Ames, Station Chief Kenneth Haas, James Lewis and most of the Beirut staff of the CIA. Others killed included William R. McIntyre, deputy director of the United States Agency for International Development, two of his aides, and four US military personnel. Janet Lee Stevens, an American journalist, human rights advocate, and scholar of Arabic literature, was also among the dead. Lebanese victims included clerical workers at the embassy, visa applicants waiting in line and nearby motorists and pedestrians. An additional 120 or so people were wounded in the bombing.\n\n==Response==\n\n===Responses===\nUS President Ronald Reagan on April 18 denounced the \"vicious terrorist bombing\" as a \"cowardly act,\" saying, \"This criminal act on a diplomatic establishment will not deter us from our goals of peace in the region.\" Two envoys, Philip C. Habib and Morris Draper, continued their peace mission in Beirut to discuss Lebanese troop withdrawals with a renewed sense of urgency.\n\nThe next day, Ambassador Robert Dillon, who had narrowly escaped injury in the bombing, said: \"Paramount among the essential business is our work for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon.\" It is only by securing Lebanese government control over the country \"that terrible tragedies like the one we experienced yesterday can be avoided in the future.\"\n\nThe President of Lebanon, Amine Gemayel, cabled President Reagan on April 18, saying, \"The Lebanese people and myself express our deepest condolences to the families of the U.S. victims. The cross of peace is the burden of the courageous.\" Meanwhile, Lebanon asked the United States, France, and Italy to double the size of the peacekeeping force. As of March 16, it numbered about 4,800 troops, including some 1,200 US Marines, 1,400 Italian soldiers, 2,100 French paratroopers and 100 British soldiers.\n\nIran denied any role in the attack. Foreign Minister, Ali Akbar Velayati said, \"We deny any involvement and we think this allegation is another propaganda plot against us.\"\n\nOn April 19, Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel sent President Reagan a message of condolence for the embassy bombing. \"I write in the name of Israel when I express to you my deep shock at the terrible outrage which took the lives of so many of the American embassy in Beirut yesterday.\" Defense Minister Moshe Arens, was quoted by Israeli radio that he told the cabinet the attack \"justified Israel's demands for security arrangements in Lebanon.\" Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel called the embassy bombing \"shocking\" but added that, \"In Lebanon nothing is surprising. I think the lesson is simple and understood. The security problems in Lebanon are still most serious, and terrorist organizations will continue to operate there, at times with great success.\"\n\n===US Congressional response===\nThe House Foreign Affairs Committee April 19 voted to approve $251 million in additional economic and military aid for Lebanon, as requested by the administration. But it attached an amendment to the bill that would force the White House to seek approval for any expanded US military role.\n\nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee followed suit April 20, approving the aid request but attaching an amendment that required the president to obtain congressional authorization for \"any substantial expansion in the number or role of US armed forces in Lebanon or for the creation of a new, expanded or extended multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon.\" If Congress did not act jointly on such a request within 60 days, however, the increase would then take effect automatically.\n\nThe Senate amendment was sponsored as a compromise by the committee's chairman, Republican Charles H. Percy of Illinois. It prevented a move by the committee's ranking Democrat, Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, to extend the 1973 War Powers Resolution to Lebanon. On April 20, Pell said he would have had the votes to apply the resolution to US Marines in Lebanon. The law limited presidential commitment of troops in hostile situations to a maximum of 90 days unless Congress specifically approved their use.\n\nDeputy Secretary of State Kenneth W. Dam, in a letter to the committee, had argued forcefully against use of the War Powers Resolution. Dam said it would \"amount to a public finding that US forces will be exposed to imminent risk of involvement in hostilities\", which \"could give entirely the wrong public impression\" of US expectations for Lebanon's future. Several influential congressmen had been urging an end to the US military role in Lebanon. After the embassy bombing, April 19, Republican Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona said, \"I think it's high time we bring the boys home.\"\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n\n===Responsibility===\nA pro-Iranian group calling itself the Islamic Jihad Organization took responsibility for the bombing in a telephone call to a news office immediately after the blast. The anonymous caller said, \"This is part of the Iranian Revolution's campaign against imperialist targets throughout the world. We shall keep striking at any crusader presence in Lebanon, including the international forces.\" The group had earlier taken responsibility for a grenade attack in which five U.S. members of the international peacekeeping force had been wounded.\n\nJudge John Bates of the US District Court in Washington, D.C. on September 8, 2003, awarded in a default judgment $123 million to 29 American victims and family members of Americans killed in the bombing. Judge Royce Lamberth of the US District Court in Washington, D.C. on May 30, 2003, determined that the bombing was carried out by the militant group Hezbollah with the approval and financing of senior Iranian officials, paving the way for the victims to seek damages. Iran was not present in court to challenge witnesses nor present evidence of their own.\n\n===Other effects===\nFollowing the attack, the embassy was moved to a supposedly more secure location in East Beirut. However, on September 20, 1984, another car bomb exploded at this embassy annex, killing twenty Lebanese and two American soldiers.\n\nThe April bombing was one of the first suicide attacks in the region. Other suicide car bombings over the next eight months included one against the US and French embassies in Kuwait, a second attack on Israeli Army's headquarters in Tyre, and the extremely destructive attacks on the US Marine and French Paratrooper barracks in Beirut on October 23, 1983.\n\nAlong with the Marine Barracks bombing, the 1983 US Embassy bombing prompted the Inman Report, a review of overseas security for the US Department of State. This in turn prompted the creation of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Diplomatic Security Service within the State Department.\n\n==See also==\n*History of Hezbollah\n*List of embassy attacks\n*Terrorist attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities\n*List of mass car bombings\n*2013 Iranian embassy bombing\n\n==References==\n\n*Goodarzi, Jubin M.

{"title":"1983 Kuwait bombings","article":"The 1983 Kuwait bombings were attacks on six key foreign and Kuwaiti installations on 12 December 1983, two months after the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing. The 90-minute coordinated attack on two embassies, the country's main airport, and petro-chemical plant was more notable for the damage it was intended to cause than what was actually destroyed. What might have been \"the worst terrorist episode of the twentieth century in the Middle East\" killed only six people because of the bombs' faulty rigging.\n\nThe perpetrators of the bombing are unknown but were purported to be connected to the Islamic Republic of Iran. The motivation of the bombing is suspected to have been punishment against Kuwait, the United States and France for their military and financial assistance to Iraq in the Iran\u2013Iraq War.\n\n==Bombings==\nOn 12 December 1983, a truck laden with 45 large cylinders of gas connected to plastic explosives broke through the front gates of the American Embassy in Kuwait City and rammed into the embassy's three-story administrative annex, demolishing half the structure. The shock blew out windows and doors in distant homes and shops.\n\nOnly five people were killed (two Palestinians, two Kuwaitis, and one Syrian) in large part because the driver did not hit the more heavily populated chancellery building and more importantly, only a quarter of the explosives ignited. An American diplomat told journalist Robin Wright: \"If everything had gone off, this place would have been a parking lot\".\n\nFive other explosions were attempted within an hour. An hour later, a car parked outside the French embassy blew up, leaving a massive 30\u00a0ft hole in the embassy security wall. No one was killed, and only five people were wounded.\n\nThe target intended to get the most powerful explosion was Kuwait's main oil refinery and water desalination plant, the Shuaiba Petrochemical Plant. 150 gas cylinders on a truck carrying 200 cylinders exploded 150 meters from the No. 2 refinery and only a few meters from a highly flammable heap of sulfa-based chemicals. Had that bombing been successful, it would have crippled the oil production of one of the world's major oil exporters and shut down most of the water supply of the nation.\n\nOther car bombs exploded at the control tower at the Kuwait International Airport, the Electricity Control Center, and the living quarters for American employees of the Raytheon Corporation, which was installing a missile system in Kuwait. Two bombs at Raytheon went off, the first intended to bring the residents outside and the second intended to kill. The attempt failed as the residents did not emerge. An Egyptian technician was killed in the control tower bombing, but none of the other bombings resulted in fatalities.\n\nThe bombing of the American embassy was an early instance of suicide bombing in the Middle East, along with the Hezbollah's bombing of the American Embassy and the bombing of the Marine barracks in Lebanon earlier that year in which Hezbollah is suspected to be the orchestrator.\n\n==Responsibility==\nIslamic Jihad Organization and Islamic Dawa Party were reported at the time to be involved in the bombing. Shortly after the blasts, Islamic Jihad called Kuwaiti authorities to take responsibility for the blast. The claim was taken seriously after the callers' boast that there was a \"seventh bomb\" was verified by the discovery of a car bomb in front of the Immigration Bureau.\n\nIslamic Dawa was connected to the bombing when the remains of a human thumb were found and its thumbprint identified as that of Raad Murtin Ajeel, a 25-year-old Iraqi Shia member of Dawa. Ultimately, 21 other defendants were put on trial (17 captured in a nationwide manhunt and 4 tried in absentia). After a six-week trial, six were sentenced to death (three of those were in absentia), seven to life imprisonment, seven to terms between five and fifteen years. One of those convicted by a court in Kuwait in February 2007 was Jamal Jafaar Mohammed, more commonly known by his nom de guerre as Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who was a member of Kata'ib Hezbollah and Iraq's parliament and military commander of the Popular Mobilization Forces.\n\n==Motivation==\nSome analysts claim the bombings were the work of Iran in cooperation with Shia allies from Iraq and Lebanon. Kuwait had given considerable support to Iraq in the 1980-1988 Iran\u2013Iraq War. Between 1983 and 1984, Kuwait provided $7 billion in financial assistance and was second to Saudi Arabia in aiding Iraq, Massive destruction and loss of life in Kuwait would also have provided an example to the other oil-rich, population-poor, Arab monarchies of the Persian Gulf, also helping Iraq against its larger, non-Arab, anti-monarchist revolutionary Islamic neighbor. In 1985, the Arab States of the Persian Gulf provided Iraq with financial contributions, totaling in the range of $40 to 50 billion.\n\nAmericans and the French are thought to have been targets in Kuwait because of their assistance to Iraq and lack of help to Iran. America had halted all shipments of arms to Iran, and extended $2 billion in trade credit to Iraq in \"Operation Staunch\" in 1983.\n\n==Response==\nThe blasts were said to have taken the Kuwaiti government \"completely by surprise\" and left it dumbfounded, terrified and shaken to their core that such a well-organized terrorist operation could have taken place under their noses. According to the Monday Morning gazette, the hitherto relaxed nation was transformed into a \"police state,\" with roundups of foreign workers, numerous roadblocks, identity checks, and guardsmen under orders to \"shoot whoever refused to stop or be searched.\"\n\n==Pressure on Kuwait to free the bombers==\nOf the \"Kuwait 17\", 12 were Iraqis in al-Dawa, and 3 were Lebanese. One was Mustafa Badr Al Din, who was sentenced to death. He was also a cousin and brother-in-law of one of Hezbollah's senior officers, Imad Mugniyah.\n\"Analysts say,... there is little doubt Mugniyeh and Al Din helped plan December 1983 bombings in Kuwait against the U.S. and French embassies there....\"\n\nBoth the organization of Hezbollah and the Islamic Republic of Iran and the location of Dawa's headquarters helped free their fellow Shia revolutionaries in Kuwait.\n\nIn Lebanon, Western hostages, including American Frank Regier and Frenchman Christian Joubert, were held by Shia radicals demanding the release of the al-Dawa terrorists as the price of the hostages' release. On 27 March 1984, following the conviction of the al-Da'wa defendants, the hostage takers threatened to kill their hostages if the Kuwaiti government carried through with the planned execution of the al-Dawa prisoners. A month later, American Benjamin Weir was kidnapped by actors demanding the same. Anglican hostage negotiator Terry Waite appealed to the Emir of Kuwait and tried to obtain a visa to come to Kuwait. His failure to make progress in freeing the convicted terrorists is thought to be the reason that he himself was kidnapped and spent five years as a hostage.\n\nAlthough those sentenced to death were to be hanged within 30 days, the Emir of Kuwait did not sign their death sentence. The executions were delayed for years until the men escaped.\n\n===Iran===\nChief Kuwaiti government spokesman Abdel Aziz Hussein called the bombings \"the first concentrated Iranian operation to export the revolution and destabilize the Persian Gulf after Iran failed to infiltrate the Iraqi [war] front.\" Kuwait was threatened with further attacks if the defendants were not released, with Tehran Radio regularly broadcasting warnings from Dawa that Kuwait would face \"serious consequences\" if the \"heroes\" standing trial were harmed.\n\n===Hezbollah===\nOver the next several years, Hezbollah perpetrated a string of kidnappings and bombings with the goal of forcing the Kuwaiti government to free the al-Dawa prisoners. Hostage Terry Anderson was told that he and the other hostages kidnapped in Beirut had been abducted \"to gain the freedom of their seventeen comrades in Kuwait.\"\n\nThe Kuwait 17 then played a role in the Iran-Contra scandal: the principals of Iran-Contra offered to sway Kuwait to release the Kuwait 17 as one of several incentives to free American hostages in Lebanon. However, when U.S. President Ronald Reagan learned of this offer, he allegedly responded \"like he had been kicked in the belly.\"\n\n==Aircraft hijackings (1984\u20131988)==\n===Kuwait Airways Flight 221===\nOn 3 December 1984, a Kuwait Airways flight from Kuwait City to Karachi, Pakistan was hijacked by four Lebanese Shi'a hijackers and diverted to Tehran. The hijackers demand was the release of the Kuwait 17, which was not met. During the course of the standoff women, children and Muslims were released and two American officials from the US Agency for International Development, Charles Hegna and William Stanford, were shot dead and dumped on the tarmac. The few dozen passengers left on board, particularly Americans were threatened and tortured. \"Every five minutes there was a frightening incident. There was no letup at all,\" British flight engineer Neil Beeston told the BBC. Paradoxically, the hijackers released a statement, claiming, \"We do not have any enmity toward anyone and we do not intend to deny the freedom of anyone or to frighten anyone....\" On the sixth day of the drama, Iranian security forces stormed the plane and released the remaining hostages. Authorities said they would be brought to trial, but the hijackers were released and allowed to leave the country. Some passengers and officials suggested complicity by Iran in the hijacking and that the hostage rescue had been staged. One Kuwaiti and two Pakistani passengers claimed that the hijackers received additional weapons and equipment once the plane had landed, including handcuffs and nylon ropes used to tie passengers to their seats. One American official wondered if the surrender was not preplanned: \"You do not invite cleaners aboard an airplane after you have planted explosives, promised to blow up the plane, and read your last will and testament.\"\n\nThe US State Department announced a $250,000 reward for information leading to the arrests of those involved in the hijacking but made no military response. Later press reports linked Hezbollah's Imad Mughniyah to the hijackings.\n\n===TWA Flight 847===\nOn 14 June 1985, TWA Flight 847 was hijacked en route from Athens to Rome. One of the demands of the hijackers was the release of the 17 prisoners held in Kuwait.\n\n===Kuwait Airways Flight 422===\nOn 5 April 1988, Kuwait Airways Flight 422 was hijacked from Bangkok to Kuwait with 111 passengers and crew aboard, including three members of the Kuwaiti Royal Family. Six or seven Lebanese men (including Hassan Izz-Al-Din, a veteran of the TWA 847 hijacking) armed with guns and hand grenades forced the pilot to land in Mashhad, Iran, and demanded the release of 17 Shiite Muslims guerrillas held in Kuwait. Lasting 16 days and traveling 3,200\u00a0mi from Mashhad in northeastern Iran to Larnaca, Cyprus, and finally to Algiers, it is the longest skyjacking to date. Two passengers, Abdullah Khalidi, 25, and Khalid Ayoub Bandar, 20, both Kuwaitis, were shot dead by the hijackers and dumped on the tarmac in Cyprus. Kuwait did not release the 17 prisoners, and the hijackers were allowed to leave Algiers.\n\n==1985 attempted assassination of Jaber==\nBy May 1985, Islamic Jihad had accumulated six hostages in Lebanon, four Americans and two French, and on 16 May, it released photos of them promising a \"horrible disaster\" if the jailed terrorists in Kuwait were not released. On 25 May 1985, a suicide car bomber attacked the motorcade of Kuwaiti ruler Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, killing two bodyguards and a passerby, wounding Jaber. Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility and again demanded the terrorists release.\n\n==Aftermath==\nEventually, the \"Kuwait 17\" prisoners gained freedom, reportedly during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, when 1,300 prisoners escaped from Kuwait's Saidia central prison. The 15 al-Da'wa prisoners were taken into custody and \"released to Iran\" by Iraqi officials.\n\nAl-Dawa has insisted that the attacks in Kuwait were perpetrated by agents \"hijacked\" by Iran. In February 2007, journalists reported that Jamal Jaafar Muhammad, who was elected to the Iraqi parliament in 2005 as part of the SCIRI\/Badr faction of the United Iraqi Alliance (UIA), was also sentenced to death in Kuwait for planning the al-Dawa bombings.\n\n==See also==\n*1981 Bahraini coup d'\u00e9tat attempt\n* Hezbollah\n* Lebanon hostage crisis\n* List of terrorist organisations\n\n==References==\n\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Jaber, Hala.

{"title":"Tyre headquarters bombings","article":"The Tyre headquarters bombings were two suicide bombings against the Israel Defense Forces' headquarters building in Tyre, Lebanon, in 1982 and 1983. The blasts killed 103 Israelis and 46\u201359 Lebanese, wounding 95 people and were some of the worst losses ever for the IDF. Israel believes both to be the responsibility of Hezbollah.\n\n==First bombing==\nAfter invading Lebanon in June, the Israeli military set up command posts to run the cities they occupied. On November 11, 1982, a Peugeot car packed with explosives struck the seven-story building being used by the Israeli military to govern Tyre. The explosion leveled the building and killed 75 Israeli soldiers, border policemen, and Shin Bet agents. In addition, anywhere from 14\u201327 Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners that were being held by Israel were killed. Twenty-seven Israelis and 28 Arabs were injured.\n\nThe Israeli government said soon after the blast, and insists to this day, that the explosion was an accident resulting from gas cylinders exploding. This is contrary to the three witnesses who saw the Peugeot speed to the building, the identification of the car's parts in the rubble of the building, and the existence of a Shin Bet report detailing the Hezbollah preparations for the bombing.\n\nThere is a monument near Baalbek, Lebanon, dedicated to 17-year-old Ahmad Qassir, the suicide bomber responsible for the attack.\n\n==Second bombing==\nAlmost a year later, a nearly identical bombing happened in Tyre. On November 4, 1983, a suicide bomber drove a pickup truck filled with explosives into a Shin Bet building at an army base in Tyre. The explosion killed 28 Israelis and 32 Lebanese prisoners, and wounded about 40 others.\n\n==See also==\n*1983 Beirut barracks bombing\n*1983 United States embassy bombing\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n*  When in Rome, don't forget the bombs of 1983 - Article on Ahmed Qassir\n*  Sacrifice and \"Self-Martyrdom\" in Shi'ite Lebanon\n*  Suicide Superpower: Martyrdom as a Weapon of Mass Destruction","urls":["https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/secretwarwithira00berg","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Foreign%20Relations\/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947\/1982-1984\/HIGHLIGHTS%20OF%20MAIN%20EVENTS-%201982-1984","http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/magazine\/article\/0,9171,952250,00.html"]}
{"title":"Dizengoff Center suicide bombing","article":"The Dizengoff Center suicide bombing (also Purim massacre) was a Palestinian terrorist attack on March 4, 1996 on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Purim. The suicide bomber blew himself up outside Dizengoff Center in downtown Tel Aviv, killing 13 Israelis and wounding 130 more. The attack was the fourth suicide bombing in Israel in nine days, bringing the death toll during that span to over 60.\n\n==The attack==\n\nThe suicide bomber detonated just before 4 pm (GMT+2) outside the Dizengoff Center, the largest shopping mall in Tel Aviv. That day the center was particularly crowded for the eve of Purim. Many in the crowd were children dressed in costume for the holiday. The bomber sought to enter the mall but turned back because of the police presence. Instead, he went into the busy intersection where a large number of pedestrians were crossing the street and set off his 20-kilogram nail bomb. Following the attack, a phone call to an Israeli radio station apparently from a Hamas representative identified the attacker as Abdel-Rahim Ishaq, a 24-year-old resident of Ramallah.\n\n===Fatalities===\nThe suicide bomber killed 13 Israelis (12 civilians and one soldier): \n\nAdditionally, a pregnant woman was injured in the blast and lost her unborn child.\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n* The Bat-Chen Diaries\n* Patches, a memorial film\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemorial to victims of the Dizengoff Center suicide bombing.","urls":["http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-%20Obstacle%20to%20Peace\/Palestinian%20terror%20since%202000\/Suicide%20and%20Other%20Bombing%20Attacks%20in%20Israel%20Since","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100403224249\/http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/mfa\/terrorism-%20obstacle%20to%20peace\/palestinian%20terror%20since%202000\/Suicide%20and%20Other%20Bombing%20Attacks%20in%20Israel%20Since","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1996\/03\/05\/world\/bombing-israel-overview-4th-terror-blast-israel-kills-14-mall-tel-aviv-nine-day.html?scp=1&sq=dizengoff%20center%20suicide&st=cse&pagewanted=print","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Palestinian+terror+before+2000\/Fatal+Terrorist+Attacks+in+Israel+Since+the+DOP+-S.htm","http:\/\/www.keren-inbar.org.il\/INB\/Front\/Document.asp?ID=22406&ENGLISH=true","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110721143431\/http:\/\/www.keren-inbar.org.il\/INB\/Front\/Document.asp?ID=22406&ENGLISH=true","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2012\/nov\/21\/tel-aviv-bus-bomb-gaza-spread"]}
{"title":"Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing","article":"The Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing, also called the Sbarro massacre, was a Palestinian terrorist attack on a pizzeria in downtown Jerusalem, Israel, on 9 August 2001, in which 15 civilians were killed, including 7 children and a pregnant woman, and 130 wounded.\n\n==Attack==\nAt the time of the bombing, the Jerusalem branch of the Sbarro pizza restaurant chain was located at the corner of King George Street and Jaffa Road in Jerusalem, one of the busiest pedestrian crossings in the region. Although not required to do so, owner Noam Amar added extra support columns on the advice of city inspectors.\n\nAhlam Tamimi, who was charged as an accomplice, scouted for a target before leading Izz al-Din Shuheil al-Masri, the suicide bomber, to the Sbarro restaurant. They arrived just before 2:00\u00a0pm, when the restaurant was filled with customers, \"dozens of women, children and babies\", and pedestrian traffic outside was at its peak. Tamimi departed before Al-Masri, thought to be carrying a rigged guitar case or wearing an explosive belt weighing 5 to 10 kilograms, containing explosives, nails, nuts and bolts, detonated his bomb.\n\nThe dead included 13 Israelis, one pregnant American, and one Brazilian, all of them civilians. Additionally, 130 were injured. Chana Nachenberg remains hospitalized, in a permanent vegetative state, more than thirteen years after the attack. She was 31 years old at the time of the bombing. Her daughter, who was not yet 3 years old at the time, was one of the few in the restaurant who came through the disaster unscathed.\n\nYocheved Shoshan, age 10, was killed, and her 15-year-old sister Miriam was severely injured with 60 nails lodged in her body, a hole in her right thigh, third degree burns on 40 percent of her body, and a ruptured spleen. According to the testimony of their mother, Esther Shoshan:\n\n\n\nMordechai and Tzira Schijveschuurder, both children of Holocaust survivors, were killed along with three of their children. Two other daughters, Leah, 11, and Chaya, 8, were critically injured. The family was Dutch. During the Holocaust, Tzira's parents were in Bergen Belsen and Theresienstadt. Mordechai's parents successfully hid from the Nazis.\n\nAccording to the testimony of Chaya Schijveschuurder:\n\n\n\nChaviv Avrahami, who saw the scene of the attack after the bombing, recounted: \"I heard a tremendous explosion, and I was thrown up a metre into the air. I knew immediately that it was a bomb attack, and a catastrophic one. There were people - babies - thrown through the window and covered with blood. The whole street was covered with blood and bodies: the dead and the dying.\" Naor Shara, a soldier who witnessed the attack, said, \"The worst thing I saw, which I think will haunt me all my life, is a baby that was sitting in a stroller outside a shop and was dead. After the explosion, the baby's mother came out of the store and started screaming hysterically.\"\n\n===Fatalities===\n\n\n\n==Perpetrators==\n\n\nBoth Hamas and the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine initially claimed responsibility, with Hamas saying that the attack was in response to Israel's assassination ten days earlier in Nablus of the two leading Hamas commanders Jamal Mansour and Omar Mansour as well as six civilians including two children.\n\nThe suicide bomber who died in the course of carrying out the attack was later identified to be Izz al-Din Shuheil al-Masri from the Palestinian West Bank town of Aqabah. Izz al-Masri was 22 at the time and the son of a successful restaurant owner, and from an affluent land-owning family.\n\nThe person who constructed the explosives was a man named as Abdallah Barghouti. For his part in this and a string of other attacks, in which 66 civilians were killed, he was handed down 67 life sentences on 30 November 2004.\n\n===Ahlam Tamimi===\n\nIzz al-Masri was escorted to the restaurant by Ahlam Tamimi, a 20-year-old female university student and part-time journalist, who had disguised herself as a Jewish tourist for the occasion. She later commented that she was not sorry for what she had done and does not recognize Israel's existence. \"Despite the fact that I'm sentenced to 16 life sentences I know that we will become free from Israeli occupation and then I will also be free from the prison,\" she said. When she first learned from a journalist who was interviewing her in jail that she had murdered eight children, not just three as she had initially believed, she just smiled broadly and continued with the interview.\n\nTamimi was released in October 2011 in exchange for the release of captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.\n\nIn an interview which aired on Al-Aqsa TV on 12 July 2012 (as translated by MEMRI), Tamimi described the reaction of other Palestinians immediately after the bombing:\n\n\n\nAfter hearing an initial report that \"three people were killed\" in the bombing, Tamimi stated:\n\n\n\n==Impact==\nThe shock of this tragedy inspired the Belzberg family to establish the ONE Family Fund, a charity that provides assistance to victims of terrorist attacks targeting Israel.\n\n==Official reactions==\n;Involved parties\n*:\n** In response to the attack, Israel shut down the unofficial Palestinian \"foreign office\" in Jerusalem, at the Orient House.\n** Foreign Minister Peres said, \"If the Palestinian Authority had acted with the necessary determination and carried out preventive detentions of Hamas terrorists and their operators, the murders today in Jerusalem would have been prevented.\"\n*:\n** Hamas and Yasser Arafat blamed Israel for the bombing.\n\n; International\n* \u2013 U.S. President George W. Bush expressed condolences and stated, \"I deplore and strongly condemn the terrorist bombing in downtown Jerusalem today. My heartfelt sympathies and those of the American people are with the victims of this terrible tragedy and their families.\"\n\n; Supranational\n* \u2013 According to the U.N. press release, \"UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan condemned today's terror attack by a suicide bomber in Jerusalem. He deplored all acts of terror and is deeply disturbed by the terrible loss of life.\"\n* \u2013 According to the Belgian EU Presidency, \"The Presidency of the European Union unreservedly condemns the bombing of a Jerusalem shopping centre today, 9 August. It abhors this cowardly act which mainly claimed the lives of innocent civilians.\"\n\n==Palestinian exhibit==\nAfter the suicide bombing, Palestinian university students at the An-Najah University in the West Bank city of Nablus created an exhibition celebrating the first anniversary of the Second Intifada. The exhibit's main attraction was a room-sized re-enactment of the bombing at Sbarro. The installation featured broken furniture splattered with fake blood and human body parts. The entrance to the exhibition was illustrated with a mural depicting the bombing. The exhibit was later shut down by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.\n\n==Response and activism of victims' families==\nIn 2001, the family of Malka Chana (Malki) Roth, a 15-year-old victim of the attack, founded The Malki Foundation, a charity organization that supports families of children with disabilities. All services and equipment are provided at no cost to the families. People of all religions and backgrounds are eligible for assistance. The organization is a memorial to Malka Roth's life. Later, Malka's parents, Arnold and Frimet Roth, participated in a mass protest in Europe alongside the families of other terror victims in support of the legality the Israeli West Bank barrier. Arnold remarked, \"Do I feel bad about the destruction the fence is causing? I do. But do not compare the murder of my daughter to the inability of a Palestinian to get to work by 9:00 A.M.\"\n\nThe husband of Shoshana Greenbaum, the pregnant woman killed in the attack, responded by organizing a group called \"Partners in Kindness\" (www.partnersinkindness.org) and writing a column called \"A Daily Dose of Kindness\". He explained that he made these efforts in attempt to \"improve the world\".\n\n===2011 prisoner exchange===\nDuring the 2011 Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange, relatives of the victims of the bombing vehemently protested the release of Ahlam Tamimi, who chose the Sbarro restaurant as a target and drove the bomber to the location.\n\nArnold and Frimet Roth circulated a petition against Tamimi's inclusion in the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange and also wrote a letter to Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu urging him to exclude her from the list. Frimet Roth said in October, \"We feel desperate. We beg Mr. Netanyahu to grant us a few minutes of his time and hear us out. In any sane country with a fair judicial system, even paroled murderers are not released without granting the victims' loved ones a chance to address the parole board.\"\n \nChaya Schijveschuurder, whose parents and three siblings were killed in the attack, protested with a sign that read, \"My parents' blood screams from the grave!\" Her brother, Shvuel, vandalized the Yitzhak Rabin memorial and commented, \"My opinions are all right compared to [Chaya's] and compared to how she feels about the deal. She was badly wounded in the [Sbarro] attack, she feels that releasing the terrorist is as if she were raped and then the rapist went and murdered her parents and is now being released. For her it's like being raped twice.\"\n\n==See also==\n\n* List of massacres committed during the Al-Aqsa Intifada\n* List of Hamas suicide attacks\n* List of Palestinian suicide attacks\n* Palestinian political violence\n* Malki Foundation\n* Israeli casualties of war\n* List of massacres in Israel\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n*  Suicide bombing at the Sbarro pizzeria in Jerusalem \u2013 Israeli MFA (with pictures)\n*  The Malki Foundation.

{"title":"Dolphinarium discotheque massacre","article":"The Dolphinarium discotheque massacre was a Hamas terror attack on 1 June 2001 in which a Hamas-affiliated Islamist terrorist blew himself up outside a nightclub on the beachfront in Tel Aviv, Israel, killing 21 Israelis, 16 of them teenagers. The majority of the victims were Israeli teenage girls, whose families had recently immigrated from the former Soviet Union.\n\n==Attack==\nSuicide bomber Saeed Hotari was standing in line on a Friday night in front of the Dolphinarium, when the area was packed with teenagers. Most of the crowd were young people from Russian-speaking families from the former Soviet Union, who were waiting for admission to a dance party at the Dolphin disco, and others were in line to enter the adjacent nightclub. Survivors of the attack later described how the young Palestinian bomber appeared to taunt his victims before the explosion, wandering among them dressed in a disguise that led his victims to mistake him for an Orthodox Jew from Asia. Before detonating his bomb, he banged a drum packed with explosives and ball-bearings, while taunting his victims in Hebrew with the words \"Something's going to happen\". At 23:27, he detonated his explosive device. Witnesses claimed that body parts lay all over the area, and that bodies were piled one above another on the sidewalk before being collected. Many civilians in the vicinity of the bombing rushed to assist emergency services.\n\nThe suicide bombing followed a failed attack attempt on the same target five months earlier.\n\n===Fatalities===\n\nOne Israeli soldier and 20 civilians, the majority teenage girls whose parents had made aliyah to Israel from the former Soviet Union, were murdered in the attack:\n\n\n\n==Perpetrators==\nBoth Islamic Jihad and a group calling itself \"Hezbollah-Palestine\" originally claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing, only to later retract the claims. Later on it was revealed that the attack was carried out by Saeed Hotari, aged 22, a militant linked to the Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas.\n\n==Official reactions==\n;Involved parties\n:\n* Israeli officials called the attack a \"massacre\".\n\n:\n* President of the Palestinian Authority Yasser Arafat condemned the attack and called for a cease-fire.\n\n; Supranational\n* \u2013 U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan stated that he \"condemns this indiscriminate terrorist attack in the strongest possible terms.\" and that the attack \"underlines the urgency of breaking the cycle of violence.\"\n\n; International\n* \u2013 The Kuwaiti Foreign Minister and acting Premier Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah stated that he does not support Palestinian suicide bombings against civilians.\n* \u2013 U.S. President George W. Bush stated that he condemns the attack in the strongest terms and that \"There is no justification for senseless attacks against innocent civilians.\"\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nAfter the attack many in the Israeli public demanded a harsh military retaliation; nevertheless, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon decided to not take any immediate retaliatory actions. US and other governments applied heavy diplomatic pressure on Israel to refrain from action. Nevertheless, the attack was later on noted as one of the reasons cited by the Israeli government for building the Israeli West Bank barrier.\n\nIn Ramallah dozens of Palestinians celebrated in the streets and fired in the air as a sign of celebration. The bomber, Saeed Hotari, was praised as a martyr by his father. President George W. Bush demanded that Yasser Arafat condemn the terrorist act. The next day, Israeli-Arabs barricaded themselves in the Hassan Bek Mosque opposite the Dolphinarium site and threw objects at the police.\n\nAccording to the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, an Israeli-based organization with close ties to the IDF, among the materials seized by the IDF in the course of Operation Defensive Shield were two documents issued by the Martyrs' Families and Injured Care Establishment, which is under the authority of the Palestinian National Authority's Ministry of Social Affairs. The documents detail the transfer of US$2,000 to the father of the suicide bomber, who was living in Jordan at that time (18 June 2001). According to the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, the transfer was made despite the suicide bomber's Hamas affiliation, despite the father's public support of the suicide bombing attack, and despite Arafat's public condemnation of the bombing.\n\n== Dolphinarium site ==\n\nAfter the bombing, the Dolphinarium discotheque was abandoned, covered with graffiti. It remained on the Tel Aviv beachfront until its demolition in May 2018.\n\nFor many years, the victim's families campaigned to permanently preserve the ruined building as a monument to the attack. Eventually, the building was demolished in order to extend the promenade along the coast. Memorial services to the victims of the attack were held every year at the site by friends and family of the victims.\n\n==See also==\n* Civilian casualties in the Second Intifada\n* Shevah Mofet \u2013 high school in Tel Aviv where seven of the killed teenagers and many of the injured studied\n* Israeli casualties of war\n* Palestinian political violence\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n\n* Tel-Aviv suicide bombing at the Dolphin disco, Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs;

{"title":"2001 Indian Parliament attack","article":"The 2001 Indian Parliament attack was a terrorist attack on the Parliament of India in New Delhi, India on 13 December 2001. The perpetrators belonged to Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) - two Pakistan-based terrorist organisations. The attack led to the deaths of six Delhi Police personnel, two Parliament Security Service personnel and a gardenerin total 9and led to increased tensions between India and Pakistan, resulting in the 2001\u201302 India\u2013Pakistan standoff. The 5 terrorists were killed outside the parliament.\n\n==Attack==\nOn 13 December 2001, five terrorists infiltrated the Parliament House in a car with Home Ministry and Parliament labels. While both the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha had been adjourned 40\u00a0minutes prior to the incident, many members of parliament (MPs) and government officials such as Home Minister LK Advani and Minister of State for Defence Harin Pathak were believed to have still been in the building at the time of the attack. More than 100 people, including major politicians were inside the parliament building at the time. The gunmen used a fake identity sticker on the car they drove and thus easily breached the security deployed around the parliamentary complex. The terrorists carried AK47 rifles, grenade launchers, pistols and grenades.\n\nThe gunmen drove their vehicle into the car of the Indian Vice President Krishan Kant (who was in the building at the time), got out, and began shooting. The Vice President's guards and security personnel shot back at the terrorists and then started closing the gates of the compound. A similar attack was carried out on the assembly of Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, during November 2001, when 38 people were killed by terrorists.\n\nDelhi Police officials said that gunmen received instructions from Pakistan and the operation was carried out under the guidance of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency. In their book The Exile: The Flight of Osama bin Laden, Cathy Scott-Clark and Adrian Levy state that then-CIA station chief Robert Grenier and Ambassador Wendy Chamberlin suspected that the ISI had approved the attack in order to force the redeployment of troops under the command of Ali Jan Aurakzai away from the Durand Line, allowing Osama bin Laden to escape into Pakistan during the Battle of Tora Bora.\n\n==Casualties==\nConstable Kamlesh Kumari of the Central Reserve Police Force was the first to spot the terrorists and was shot by them as she raised the alarm. She died on the spot. One gunman's suicide vest exploded when he was shot dead; the other four gunmen were also killed. The ministers and MPs escaped unhurt. The total number killed was 9 and at least 22 other people were injured in the attack.\n\n==Perpetrators==\nDelhi Police stated that five terrorists carried out the attack and the names given by them were: Hamza, Haider alias Tufail, Rana, Ranvijay and Mohammed - who were allegedly members of Lashkar-e-Taiba - were killed.\n\n==Trial==\nThe attack triggered extensive investigations which revealed involvement of four accused, namely Mohammad Afzal Guru, Shaukat Hussain Guru (cousin of Afzal Guru) and S.A.R. Gilani (Syed Abdul Rahman Gilani) and Shaukat's wife Afsan Guru (Navjot Sandhu before marriage). Some other proclaimed offenders were said to be the leaders of the banned terrorist organisation known as Jaish-e-Mohammed. After the conclusion of investigation, investigating agency filed the report under Section 173 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (India) against four accused persons on 14 May 2002. Charges were framed under various sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002 (POTA), and the Explosive Substances Act by the designated sessions Court.\n\nThe designated Special Court was presided over by S. N. Dhingra. The accused were tried and the trial concluded within a record period of about six months. 80 witnesses were examined for the prosecution and 10 witnesses were examined on behalf of the accused S.A.R. Gilani. About 300 documents were exhibited. Afzal Guru, Shaukat Hussain and S.A.R. Gilani were convicted for the offences under Sections 121, 121A, 122, Section 120B read with Sections 302 & 307 read with Section 120B of IPC, sub-Sections (2), (3) and (5) of Section 3 and Section 4(b) of POTA and Sections 3 and 4 of Explosive Substances Act. The accused 1 and 2 were also convicted under Section 3(4) of POTA.\n\nAccused 4, namely Navjot Sandhu a.k.a. Afsan, was acquitted of all the charges except the one under Section 123 IPC for which she was convicted and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for five years and to pay a fine. Death sentences were imposed on the other three accused for the offences under Section 302 read with Section 120B IPC and Section 3(2) of POTA. They were also sentenced to life imprisonment on as many as eight counts under the provisions of IPC, POTA and Explosive Substances Act in addition to varying amounts of fine. The amount of a million Indian rupees, which was recovered from the possession of two of the accused, namely, Afzal Guru and Shaukat Hussain, was forfeited to the State under Section 6 of the POTA.\n\nOn appeal, the high court subsequently acquitted S. A. R. Geelani and Afsan, but upheld Shaukat's and Afzal's death sentence. Geelani was represented by Ram Jethmalani in the Delhi High Court and subsequently in the Supreme Court of India. Jethmalani said it almost cost him his political career for defending Geelani. Geelani's acquittal blew a gaping hole in the prosecution's version of the parliament attack. He was presented as the mastermind of the entire attack. Geelani, a young lecturer at Delhi University, received support from his outraged colleagues and friends, who were certain that he had been framed. They contacted the well-known lawyer Nandita Haksar and asked her to take on his case.\n\nShaukat Hussain was released nine months prior to his scheduled date of release, because of his \"good conduct\".\n\nTwo Delhi Police officials, ACP Rajbir Singh and Mohan Chand Sharma are credited for gathering prima facie evidence in the case. Singh was later shot dead by a friend over a property deal and Sharma was killed during the Batla House encounter with terrorists in Delhi.\n\n==Response==\n\nThe Indian Government initially accused Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed of involvement in the attack. However, Lashkar-e-Taiba denied any involvement in the incident. In November 2002, four JeM members were arrested by Indian authorities and put on trial. All four were found guilty of playing various roles in the incident, although the fourth, Afsan\/Navjot Sandhu, wife of Shaukat Hussain (one of the accused) was found guilty of a minor charge of concealing knowledge of conspiracy. One of the accused, Afzal Guru, was sentenced to death for the incident.\n\nWorld leaders and leaders in India's immediate neighbourhood condemned the attack on the Parliament. On 14 December, the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) blamed Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed for the attack. Home Minister LK Advani claimed, \"We have received some clues about yesterday's incident, which shows that a neighbouring country, and some terrorist organisations active there behind it\", in an indirect reference to Pakistan and Pakistan-based terrorist groups.\n\nThe same day, in a demarche to Pakistani High Commissioner to India, Ashraf Jehangir Qazi, India demanded that Pakistan stop the activities of LeT and JeM, that Pakistan apprehend the organisations' leaders and that Pakistan curb the financial assets and the groups' access to these assets. In response to the Indian government's statements, Pakistani forces were put on high alert the same day. On 20 December, India mobilised and deployed its troops to Kashmir and Punjab in what was India's largest military mobilisation since the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War.\n\nFollowing the attack, many suspects were arrested, and in December 2002 four Jaish-e-Mohammed members were convicted for roles in the attack. In 2003, the Border Security Force (BSF) killed Ghazi Baba, the commander-in-chief of Jaish-e-Mohammed and the mastermind of the attack, in the Noor Bagh neighborhood of Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nAfzal Guru, sentenced to death by Indian court and due to be hanged on 20 October 2006, had his execution stayed. His family had camped in New Delhi to meet the President Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam to accept the mercy petition. The family of Kamlesh Kumari Jatav, a CRPF Jawan who died in the attack has said that they would return the Ashok Chakra, if the president accepted the petition, and on 13 December 2006, the families of the deceased returned the medals to the government. As of April 2007, the then President of India, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, refused to interfere in the judicial process.\n\nThe sentence was scheduled to be carried out on 20 October 2006, but Afzal was given a stay of execution and remained on death row.

{"title":"2002 Mombasa attacks","article":"The 2002 Mombasa attacks was a two-pronged terrorist attack on 28 November 2002 in Mombasa, Kenya against an Israeli-owned hotel and a plane belonging to Arkia Airlines. An all-terrain vehicle crashed through a barrier outside the Paradise Hotel and blew up, killing 13 and injuring 80. At the same time, attackers fired two surface-to-air missiles at an Israeli charter plane. The Paradise Hotel was the only Israeli-owned hotel in the Mombasa area. The attacks were believed to be orchestrated by al-Qaeda operatives in Somalia in an attempt to disrupt the Israeli tourist industry on the African continent. Much speculation has occurred as to who the perpetrators are, but no complete list of suspects has been defined. The attack was the second al-Qaeda terrorist operation in Kenya, following the bombing of the U.S. embassy in Nairobi in 1998. Following the attack, the UN Security Council and other nations condemned the bombing.\n\n== Attacks ==\n\n=== Hotel bombing ===\nThree men in a 4-wheel drive SUV approached the gate of the Paradise Hotel and were questioned by security guards. One of the men leapt from the car and detonated an explosive vest he was wearing. The other two men rammed the vehicle through the barrier, crashing into the front entrance of the hotel and set off the bomb they had in the car. The blast occurred on the eve of Hanukkah just after some 60 visitors had checked into the hotel, all of them from Israel for a holiday stay. Thirteen people were killed and 80 injured. Ten Kenyans died in the attack and three Israelis, two of them children. Nine of the victims were dancers who had been employed to welcome hotel guests. In an overnight rescue mission, four Israeli military Hercules planes were sent to Mombasa to evacuate the dead and injured.\n\n=== Aircraft attack ===\n\nAlmost simultaneous to the attack on the hotel, two shoulder-launched Strela 2 (SA-7) surface-to-air missiles were fired at a chartered Boeing 757 airliner owned by Israel-based Arkia Airlines as it took off from Moi International Airport. The Arkia charter company had a regular weekly service flying tourists between Tel Aviv and Mombasa. Kenyan police discovered a missile launcher and two missile casings in the Changamwe area of Mombasa, about  from the airport. The pilots planned on an emergency landing in Nairobi after seeing the two missiles streak past them, but decided to continue to Israel. The airliner landed at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv about five hours later, escorted by Israeli F-15 fighter jets. Following the attack, all flights from Israel to Kenya were cancelled indefinitely.\n\n==Perpetrators==\nSheikh Omar Bakri Mohammed, leader of the London-based Islamic organisation Al Muhajiroun, said that warnings had appeared on the Internet. \"Militant groups who sympathise with Al-Qaeda warned one week ago that there would be an attack on Kenya and they mentioned Israelis,\" he said. Initially, Israeli government spokesmen denied that such a warning had been received. But four days after the blast, Brigadier-General Yossi Kuperwasser admitted that Israeli military intelligence were aware of a threat in Kenya, but that it was not specific enough. Former Mossad head Danny Yatom took a similar line, saying that Israel got so many terror warnings they were not taken seriously.\n\nIn Lebanon, a previously unknown group called the Army of Palestine has said it carried out the attacks and said it wanted the world to hear the \"voice of the refugees\" on the 55th anniversary of the partition of Palestine.\n\nOn 20 December 2006, Salad Ali Jelle, Defence Minister of Somalia's Transitional Federal Government, said that one of the suspects, Abu Taha al-Sudan, was an Islamic Courts Union leader fighting against the Transitional Federal Government in the 2006 Battle of Baidoa. On 14 September 2009, American troops killed Kenya-born Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan after a missile struck his car in the Barawe District, 250 kilometers south of Somalia's capital Mogadishu. Nabhan is believed to have bought the truck used in the 2002 bombing.\n\nFazul Abdullah Mohammed is a foreign leader of the jihadist fundamentalist group, Al-Shabaab, which has pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda. Mohammed was appointed leader of al-Qaeda operations in East Africa. He was a participating member of the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombing in Nairobi and was one of the masterminds behind the coordination of the attack in Mombassa. He saw the attack as a failure because of the Strela 2 missiles missing the plane during take off. \n\nMohammed Abdul Malik Bajabu confessed in 2007 to assisting in the car bombings that took place at The Paradise Hotel. He was arrested by Kenyan authorities and is currently imprisoned by the U.S. in Guantanamo Bay without any formal charges against him. There have been four other suspected attackers affiliated with the al-Qaeda cell in Kenya, but the Kenyan prosecutors have had trouble establishing guilt with certainty. The four Kenyan nationals have been acquitted for lack of evidence. \n\nThere also has been speculation of involvement by Somali terrorist organization known as, Al Ittihad al Islamiya (AIAI). AIAI has supposed ties with al-Qaeda. They had hoped that by sending a message to the Israelis through this attack, they would grow closer to achieving their goal of establishing a Somali Islamic state.\n\n=== Motivation ===\nIt is believed that the terrorist cell, al-Qaeda, sought out to severely diminish Israeli activities on the African continent. The two simultaneous attacks had a direct impact on the Israeli tourism industry. The Paradise Hotel was an Israeli owned beachfront property that many Israeli vacationers frequented. The Al-Shabaab militant group is majorly concentrated in Somalia and because of weak border security, often spills over into Kenya. Kenya has a minority Muslim population that has historically been alienated, and with a growing dissent for Western activities with Kenyan borders, it has enabled a growing number of jihadist Muslims in Nairobi. The Muslim community in Kenya has lost political and economic representation leading up to the attacks, which lead them to focus their loyalty on Islam and the Middle East, not the nation. This enabled the jihadist movement to acquire a strong grip within Kenya, as Kenyan nationals assisted in the attacks on the Paradise Hotel and on the Boeing 757.\n\n==International response==\nImmediately following the attacks, Israel began evacuating all Israeli citizens within Kenyan borders. A joint operation began between the United States and Israel in determining who the perpetrators were of the attack. President George W Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell of the United States, Israel's Foreign Minister Benyamin Netanyahu,  the Kenyan government, and United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Jack Straw all condemned the attack. The United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1450 condemning the attacks, Syria was the only country to not affirm the resolution due to the implied power of directly intervening in the affected country's internal affairs after a terrorist attack. They also found distaste with the repeated mention of Israel in the resolution, which was against their political view concerning the conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Palestine.\n\n=== Investigation ===\nAs a result of the U.S. embassy bombing in 1998 and the attacks in Mombassa, Kenya-U.S. cooperation between authorities has strengthened. It was a joint effort between Kenya, the U.S., and Israel to apprehend the attackers. They were able to determine that al-Qaeda operatives were behind the attacks due to the similarities between the incidents in Nairobi and Mombassa. The attackers had used car bombs sourced from local materials. To plan and coordinate the attacks, al-Qaeda operatives rented houses in affluent neighborhoods to meet up with the non-Kenyan suicide bombers. \n\n==== Aftermath ====\nIn 2003 Western countries advised all of their citizens against traveling to Kenya because of the terrorist threat. This negatively impacted Kenya's economy which was based mostly in the tourism industry. Following the advisories and the suspension of British Airways flights to Nairobi, the Kenyan economy began losing nearly $130 million per week. Kenya has always been a focus for Islamist terrorist organizations, the U.N. Habitat Program and the U.N. Environment Program are based in the country.\n\n== References==\n\n\n== External links==\n*   After Blast, Kenya Reviews Qaeda's Trail in East Africa, The New York Times, 1 December 2002\n*  ATTACKS IN MOMBASA: Kenyans Hunting for Clues; Bombing Toll Rises to 13, The New York Times, 30 November 2002\n*  THE GRIEVERS: Israelis Return in Trauma From Supposed Haven, The New York Times, 30 November 2002\n*  INVESTIGATION: U.S. Suspects Qaeda Link to Bombing in Mombasa, The New York Times, 30 November 2002\n*   Source of Bombs?

{"title":"2002 Bali bombings","article":"The 2002 Bali bombings occurred on 12 October 2002 in the tourist district of Kuta on the Indonesian island of Bali. The attack killed 202 people (including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians, 23 Britons, and people of more than 20 other nationalities). A further 209 people were injured.\n\nVarious members of Jemaah Islamiyah, a violent Islamist group, were convicted in relation to the bombings, including three individuals who were sentenced to death. The attack involved the detonation of three bombs: a backpack-mounted device carried by a suicide bomber; a large car bomb, both of which were detonated in or near popular nightclubs in Kuta; and a third much smaller device detonated outside the United States consulate in Denpasar, causing only minor damage. An audio-cassette purportedly carrying a recorded voice message from Osama bin Laden stated that the Bali bombings were in direct retaliation for support of the United States' War on Terror and Australia's role in the liberation of East Timor.\n\nOn 8 November 2008, Imam Samudra, Amrozi Nurhasyim and Huda bin Abdul Haq were executed by firing squad on the island prison of Nusakambangan at 00:15 local time (17:15 UTC). On 9 March 2010, Dulmatin, nicknamed \"the Genius\" \u2013 believed to be responsible for setting off one of the Bali bombs with a mobile phone \u2013 was killed in a shoot-out with Indonesian police in Jakarta.\n\n==Attack==\n\n\nAt 23:05 Central Indonesian Time on 12 October 2002, a suicide bomber inside the nightclub Paddy's Pub (sometimes referred to as Paddy\u2019s Irish Bar) detonated a bomb in his backpack, causing many patrons, with or without injuries, to immediately flee into the street. Twenty seconds later, a second and much more powerful car bomb hidden inside a white Mitsubishi van was detonated by another suicide bomber outside the Sari Club, a renowned open-air thatch-roof bar located opposite Paddy's Pub.\n\nThe bombing occurred during one of the busiest tourist periods of the year in Kuta Beach, driven in part by many Australian sporting teams making their annual end-of-season holiday.\n\nDamage to the densely populated residential and commercial district was immense, destroying neighbouring buildings and shattering windows several blocks away. The car bomb explosion left a one metre deep crater.\n\nThe local Sanglah Hospital was ill-equipped to deal with the scale of the disaster and was overwhelmed with the number of injured, particularly burn victims. There were so many people injured by the explosion that some of the injured had to be placed in hotel pools near the explosion site to ease the pain of their burns. Many of the injured were forced to be flown extreme distances to Darwin and Perth for specialist burn treatment.\n\nA comparatively small bomb detonated outside the U.S. consulate in Denpasar, which is thought to have exploded shortly before the two Kuta bombs, caused minor injuries to one person and property damage was minimal. It was reportedly packed with human excrement.\n\nA report released in August 2005 by the United States-Indonesia Society (USINDO) described the events as follows:\nThe investigators were thus able to recreate the bombers activities. Amrozi, Idris and Ali Imron had simply walked into a dealership and purchased a new Yamaha motorbike, after asking how much they could re-sell it for if they returned it in a few days. Imron used the motorbike to plant the small bomb outside the U.S. Consulate. Idris then rode the motorbike as Imron drove two suicide bombers in the Mitsubishi to the nightclub district in Kuta. He stopped near the Sari Club, instructed one suicide bomber to put on his explosives vest and the other to arm the vehicle bomb. The first bomber headed to Paddy's Pub. Idris then left the second bomber, who had only learned to drive in a straight line, to drive the minivan the short distance to the Sari Club. Idris picked up Imron on the Yamaha and the duo headed back into Denpasar. Idris dialed the number of the Nokia to detonate the bomb at the Consulate. The two suicide bombers exploded their devices. Imron and Idris dropped the motorbike at a place where it eventually attracted the attention of the caretaker.\n\n\nThe final death toll was 202, mainly comprising Western tourists and holiday-makers in their 20s and 30s who were in or near Paddy's Pub or the Sari Club, but also including many Balinese Indonesians working or living nearby, or simply passing by. Hundreds more people suffered horrific burns and other injuries. The largest group among those killed were tourists from Australia with 88 fatalities. On 14 October, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1438 condemning the attack as a threat to international peace and security.\n\n===Awards===\nThere were many acts of individual heroism.\n\nKusitino 'Kossy' Halemai, a Wallis and Futuna-born Australian citizen who was managing the Bounty Hotel in Kuta at the time of the attacks, sheltered survivors in the immediate aftermath of the blasts. He was singled out for praise with the award of the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) on 13 June 2005.\n\nHusband and wife Richard and Gilana Poore, who organized a makeshift triage area in the Bounty Hotel's reception area, were both honored with an OAM.\n\nJames Parkinson, an emergency nurse, worked alongside Doctor Hogg from Wollongong in the Denpasar Sanglah Hospital running the trauma centre for the bombing victims. After he disappeared in Africa and Europe for three years, the Governor General's department finally tracked him down and awarded Parkinson the Medal of the Order of Australia in 2005.\n\nSenior Constable Timothy Britten and Mr Richard Joyes of Western Australia were both awarded the Cross of Valour for their actions during the course of the day. The Cross of Valour is the highest civilian honor and is equivalent to the Victoria Cross for Australia which is the highest military honor.\n\n===The bomb===\nThe Mitsubishi L300 van bomb was initially thought to have consisted of C4, a military grade plastic explosive which is difficult to obtain. However, investigators discovered the bomb was made from potassium chlorate, aluminium powder, and sulfur. For the Sari club bomb with the L300 van, the terrorists assembled 12 plastic filing cabinets filled with explosives. The cabinets, each containing a potassium chlorate, aluminum powder, sulfur mixture with a TNT booster, was connected by  of PETN-filled detonating cord. Ninety-four RDX electric detonators were fitted to the TNT. The total weight of the van bomb was .\nThe large, high-temperature blast damage produced by this mixture was similar to a thermobaric explosive, although the bombers may not have known this.\n\n==Suspects==\nThe organization suspected of responsibility for the bombing was Jemaah Islamiyah, an Islamist group allegedly led by radical cleric Abu Bakar Bashir. A week after the blasts, Arab satellite channel Al-Jazeera put to air an audio-cassette purportedly carrying a recorded voice message from Osama Bin Laden saying that the Bali bombings were in retaliation for support of the United States' war on terror and Australia's role in the liberation of East Timor.\n\"You will be killed just as you kill, and will be bombed just as you bomb\", \"Expect more that will further distress you.\" The recording did not however claim responsibility for the Bali attack. However, former FBI agent Ali Soufan confirmed in his book, The Black Banners, that al-Qaeda did in fact finance the attack. In addition, Hambali confessed that al-Qaeda had sent him $US30,000 to fund the bombings of the two nightclubs.\n\nThe Indonesian chief of police, General Da'i Bachtiar said that the bombing was the \"worst act of terror in Indonesia's history\".\n\nAris Munandar (aka Sheik Aris) is a Jemaah Islamiyah associate linked to Bashir. He is believed to have assisted the Bali bomber Amrozi in acquiring some of the explosives used in the Bali bombings. Philippine intelligence considers Munandar to be associated with Mohammad Abdullah Sughayer, a Saudi national Abu Sayyaf Group in southern Philippines. Munandar is still at large. A report by the United States-Indonesia Society describes the arrest of Amrozi and other suspects.\nGeneral Pastika ordered his men to make the arrest early the next morning, November. Amrozi was asleep in the rear of the house. According to Greg BartonGosh, you guys are very clever, how did you find me?\" Amrozi's mobile phone, a particularly important piece of evidence, was seized during his arrest. Bags of chemical ingredients for bombs were found in his workshop and soil samples taken from outside his home showed traces of the primary chemical used in the Sari Club bomb. Police found receipts for the purchase of chemicals used to make the bombs, as well as a list of expenses incurred in making the bombs. Further search of Amrozi's home revealed copies of speeches by Osama bin Laden, and Abu Bakar Bashir, the radical Indonesian Muslim cleric reputed to be the leader of Jemaah Islamiyah. The speeches exhorted listeners to wage jihad. Police also uncovered training manuals on ambush techniques and numerous articles on jihad. Under questioning Amrozi revealed the names of six others involved in the bombing: Ali Imron, Imam Samudra, Dul Matin, Idris, Abdul Ghani and Umar Patek. But Amrozi's mobile phone proved to be the real catch. Indonesian investigators were able to print out a list of calls he had made immediately before, during and after the bombing, as well as the names and telephone numbers in the phone's memory. Pastika kept Amrozi's arrest secret for two days. After it was announced, Polri monitored the sudden flurry of communications among numbers listed in Amrozi's telephone before the calls abruptly ceased. The investigators were able to identify the location of a number of the telephones, leading to a series of arrests.\n\nIndonesian authorities also believe more suspects remain at large. In 2005, Indonesian police arrested 24 additional people suspected of involvement in the Bali attacks and a 2003 bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta.\n\nOn 12 October 2005, a story in Australian broadcaster SBS's documentary series Dateline, called \"Inside Indonesia's War on Terrorism\", argued that the Indonesian military or police may have been involved in executing the attack.\n\nOn 13 June 2007, it was reported that Abu Dujana, who might have headed a terrorist cell in Bali, was captured.\n\nJust past midnight on 9 November 2008, the three convicted of carrying out the bombings (Imam Samudra, Amrozi Nurhasyim, and Ali Ghufron) were executed by a firing squad.\n\nUmar Patek was finally arrested in Abbottabad Pakistan in early 2011. The U.S. government had offered a US$1 million reward for his arrest. Patek is a suspect in other bombings as well as the one in Bali.\n\n==Legal proceedings==\n\n===Initial charges and trials===\nIn April 2003, Indonesian authorities charged Abu Bakar Bashir (also rendered \"Ba'asyir\"), the alleged spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, with treason. It was alleged that he tried to overthrow the government and establish an Islamic state. The specific charges against Bashir related to a series of church bombings on Christmas Eve in 2000, and to a plot to bomb United States and other Western interests in Singapore. He was initially not charged over the Bali attack, although he was frequently accused of being the instigator or inspirer of the attack. On 2 September, Bashir was acquitted of treason but convicted of lesser charges and sentenced to a prison term of four years. He said he would appeal. On 15 October 2004, he was arrested by the Indonesian authorities and charged with involvement in another bomb attack, which killed 14 people at the J. W. Marriott hotel in Jakarta on 5 August 2003. Secondary charges in this indictment accused him of involvement in the Bali bombing, the first time he faced charges in relation to this attack. On 3 March 2005, Bashir was found not guilty of the charges surrounding the 2003 bombing, but guilty of conspiracy over the 2002 attacks in Bali. He was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment. The Australian, US, and many governments expressed its disappointment that the sentence was too short; in the outcome, Bashir was freed 14 June 2006 having served less than 26 months for his conspiracy, and on 21 December 2006, Bashir's conviction was overturned by Indonesia's Supreme Court.\n\nOn 30 April 2003, the first charges related to the Bali bombings were made against Amrozi bin Haji Nurhasyim, known as Amrozi, for allegedly buying the explosives and the van used in the bombings. On 8 August, he was found guilty and sentenced to death. Another participant in the bombing, Imam Samudra, was sentenced to death on 10 September. Amrozi's brother, Ali Imron, who had expressed remorse for his part in the bombing, was sentenced to life imprisonment on 18 September. A fourth accused, Ali Ghufron, the brother-in-law of Noordin Mohammed Top was sentenced to death on 1 October. Ali Ghufron, alias Mukhlas, told police that he was the head of one of Jemaah Islamiyah's four cells and had ordered the Bali bombings. He also confessed that a fellow leader Riduan Isamuddin, known as Hambali, had provided the funds for the attacks. He told police, I do not know for sure the source of the aforementioned money from Hambali; most probably it was from Afghanistan, that is, from Sheikh Usama bin Laden. As far as I know, Hambali did not have a source of funds except from Afghanistan. Another operative, Wan Min bin Wan Mat, revealed to police that he had given Mukhlas money, at Hambali's request and that he understood part of the money had come directly from al-Qaeda.\n\nAs noted below, all three were executed on 9 November 2008.\nThe Australian, US, and many other foreign governments expressed satisfaction with the speed and efficiency with which the Indonesian police and courts dealt with the bombings primary suspects, despite what they characterized as light sentences. All Australian jurisdictions abolished the death penalty more than 30 years ago, but a poll showed that 77% of Australians approved of the death sentence for Amrozi. The Australian government said it would not ask Indonesia to refrain from using the death penalty.\n\nOn 15 August, Riduan Isamuddin, generally known as Hambali, described as the operational chief of Jemaah Islamiyah was arrested in Ayutthaya, Thailand, the old capital one hour's drive north of Bangkok. He is in American custody in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.\n\n===Constitutional appeals===\nOn 23 July 2004, one of the convicted bombers, Maskur Abdul Kadir, successfully appealed his conviction. He had been tried under retroactive laws which were introduced after the bombing and which were employed to aid the prosecution of those involved in the attack. These laws were used by the prosecution instead of existing criminal laws as they allowed the death penalty to be imposed and lowered certain evidentiary restrictions.\n\nThe highest court in Indonesia, the Constitutional Court, found by a margin of five to four that trying the terrorist suspects under these retroactive laws violated Article 28I(1) of the constitution [2]. The minority judges argued that international human rights documents such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights allowed an exception to not applying retrospective legislation in the prosecution of crimes against humanity. The majority found that this argument was inconsistent with the text of Article 28I(1) which states that the rights listed there \"cannot be limited under any circumstances.\"\n\n\n\nFollowing this decision, charges related to the bombings against Idris, who had confessed to participating in the attacks to the police and court, were dismissed. The legal status of Kadir, Idris and others who might have their convictions quashed following the ruling on the retrospective law is unclear.\n\nThe Constitutional Court is a relatively new body, created after the fall of Suharto, and this decision was one of the first to overrule the constitutionality of the government's application of a law.\n\n===Execution of perpetrators===\nOn 24 October 2008, Bali officials announced that three men convicted of carrying out the bombings would be executed by firing squad in November 2008. On 25 October 2008, Communications and Information Minister asked the Indonesian media to stop calling the three \"heroes\".\n\nThe Denpasar District Court, on 3 November, accepted a reprieve motion to reconsider the death sentences. Fahmi Bachmid, a lawyer for the family of Jafar Sodiq, a brother of Amrozi and Mukhlas, stated: \"We lodged the judicial review to Denpasar court to question (previous) decisions.\" Lawyer Imam Asmara Hadi stated: \"We have lodged an appeal because we haven't received a copy of the Supreme Court rejection of our previous appeal.\"\n\nIndonesia's Supreme Court denied previous petitions for judicial review amid the constitutional court's dismissal of the bombers' appeals. Denpasar court official Nengah Sanjaya said the 3-page appeal would be sent to a Cilacap, central Java court. But the Attorney General's office said on 1 November the execution was \"very close.\" Supreme Court judge Djoko Sarwoko, however, said a \"last-minute legal challenge by the relatives of Imam Samudra, Amrozi Nurhasyim and Ali Ghufron will not change or delay the execution.\" They were moved to isolation cells, and execution spots were ready on the Nusakambangan island prison where they were being held. Local chief prosecutor Muhammad Yamin said they would be \"executed simultaneously\" but at different locations.\n\nImam Samudra, Amrozi Nurhasyim and Ali Ghufron were executed by firing squad after midnight on 9 November 2008 (West Indonesian time). In the final moment, there was no remorse or repentance, and they shouted: Allahu Akbar, or \"God is great!\" For burial, Mukhlas and Amrozi's bodies were flown by helicopter to Tenggulan, Lamongan, East Java, while Imam Samudra's body was flown to Serang, Banten, amid \"welcome martyrs\" banner displayed at the cemetery.\n\nThe execution caused high tension and sparked clashes in Tenggulan between hundreds of police and supporters. Indonesian singer and TV presenter Dorce Gamalama attended the funeral of Imam Samudra. After praying with the crowd, she spent half an hour in the house of the executed man and spoke with his mother. On leaving she was quoted as saying \"I'm certain he's gone to heaven\". Ma'ruf Amin, deputy chairman of the Indonesian Ulemas Council, the chief body for Islamic clerics in Indonesia said of the men: \"They did not die a holy death. That can only be in a war and Indonesia is not at war.\"\n\n==Memorials==\n\n===Bali===\n\n\n\nA permanent memorial was built on the site of the destroyed Paddy's Pub on Legian Street. (A new bar, named \"Paddy's: Reloaded\", was reopened further along Legian Street). The memorial is made of intricately carved stone, set with a large marble plaque, which bears the names and nationalities of each of those killed. It is flanked by the national flags of the victims. The monument is well-maintained and illuminated at night.\n\nThe memorial was dedicated on 12 October 2004, the second anniversary of the attack. The dedication included a Balinese Hindu ceremony and the opportunity for mourners to lay flowers and other offerings. The Australian ambassador and Indonesian officials attended the ceremony.\n\nThe Balinese mark their commitment in a nine-day-long event. After major cleansing ceremonies, establishing a memorial for the lost lives, and paying respect to those who left loved ones behind, the people of Kuta look forward to restoring Bali's image through an event named \"Kuta Karnival\u00a0\u2014 A Celebration of Life\". The community event consists of traditional art performances such as Balinese Sunset Dances, sports on the beach as well as in the water for young and old plus rows and rows of culinary displays along the one kilometre of sandy beach.\n\nIn line with the return of tourism to Kuta, Kuta Karnival has grown into a tourism promotional event with major coverage from television and newspapers from across the globe. Companies, embassies, Non-Government Organizations, associations and even individuals come forth to get involved in the various events such as a Balinese dance competition presented by a surf-wear company, an environment exhibition presented by an embassy, a fun cycle presented by a group of individuals, a seminar presented by an association and a parade on the streets presented by an NGO. Tourists and locals alike, more than ninety thousand people participates in the numerous events, year after year.\n\nA repeated tragedy in Bali in 2005 did not reduce the Kuta community's determination to carry out this annual event. Kuta Karnival is conducted to commemorate and give respect to the victims of human violence and show the world the true spirit of local community survival despite terrorism attacks.\n\nOn 12 October 2010, Australian and Indonesian survivors of the 2002 bombings attended a solemn commemoration service to mark the eighth anniversary of the devastating attacks.\n\n====Melbourne====\n\nIn Lincoln Square on the western side of Swanston Street, Melbourne, is a memorial representing the 88 Australians who died in the bombings, and notably the 22 from Victoria.\n\nThere are 88 jets in the fountain; at night there are lights representing all those who died. The fountain shuts off and becomes a reflecting pool on 12 October each year.\n\nThis was one of the very few fountains allowed to operate during the drought in 2007.\n\n====Jason McCartney====\nOne Melburnian survivor of the bombings was Jason McCartney, who was playing in the AFL for North Melbourne. He suffered second-degree burns to over 50% of his body while helping carry others to safety and nearly died during surgery after being transported back to Melbourne.\n\n\nOn 6 June 2003, after a long rehabilitation process, McCartney successfully returned to action for the Kangaroos in the Round 11 (Queen's Birthday) match against Richmond in front of 43,200 people at Docklands Stadium (Telstra Dome then, now Marvel Stadium), and the match \u2013 featuring the two Victorian teams in the top 8 (in finals position) heading into the round \u2013 functioned as another memorial to those lost during the bombings. McCartney, who was wearing compression garments and wore protective gloves, wore the numbers \"88\" and \"202\" on the front of his long-sleeved guernsey, signifying the Australian and total numbers of victims, while many in the crowd held up signs saying \"Bali 88\/202\". Other Australian victims were honored in a video shown on the stadium's video screens before the game, and representatives from five Australian rules football clubs who lost players in the attacks were presented to the crowd. Retired Melbourne player Steven Febey and young Demon Steven Armstrong, who suffered shrapnel injuries in the blast, also attended the match.\n\nNormally a defender, McCartney came on as a substitute at full forward to cheers from both sets of supporters, and early in the fourth quarter, he took a mark inside the forward 50-metre line and kicked a goal from the resulting set shot to put the Kangaroos ahead by nine. With two minutes remaining and the Tigers having retaken the lead by three points, he also collected a bouncing pass inside the forward 50 and kicked the ball through to Leigh Harding, who finished the goal from close range to put the Kangaroos ahead again to stay. North Melbourne eventually won by 13.14 (92) to Richmond's 13.11 (89).\n\nMcCartney announced his retirement from the AFL during his emotional on-field post-match interview, citing that his road back had left him spent and that he preferred to leave on a high note. To this day, it is considered one of the most inspirational sports-related stories in Australia, with Fox Footy's AFL: The Greatest ranking it as #7 on its list of the biggest AFL news stories of all-time. The image of McCartney being chaired off the ground after the game is also captured in Jamie Cooper's painting The Game That Made Australia, commissioned by the AFL in 2008 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Australian rules football. In 2020, in an official YouTube video, the AFL ranked McCartney's comeback as the most memorable AFL moment at Docklands Stadium in its 20-year history ahead of the likes of Hawthorn's Lance Franklin completing his 100-goal season against Carlton and Essendon's James Hird's famous final quarter against the West Coast Eagles.\n\nHired by the Western Bulldogs as their list manager, McCartney went on to win the AFL Premiership that had eluded him as a player during the Bulldogs' surprise 2016 season (McCartney had been suspended for the 1999 Grand Final, which North Melbourne had won against Carlton.) He is currently the list manager for the Greater Western Sydney Giants and a successful motivational speaker. He also published an autobiography, After Bali, recounting his ordeal after the bombings and his road back to the AFL, and also married Melissa Vanderheyden, who he had been engaged to before the bombings, just 63 days after the attacks. A medal named after McCartney is also awarded to the most courageous player during contests between North Melbourne and Collingwood, McCartney's original team.\n\n===Perth===\n\nA memorial which lists the victims of the bombings from Western Australia was opened on the first anniversary, and is situated on the ridge of Mount Eliza in Kings Park, overlooking the city. The memorial is specifically designed to frame the sun's rays at dawn on 12 October each year and faces in the exact direction of Bali.\n\n===Gold Coast===\nAn Indonesian-style stone memorial is situated in Allambe Memorial Park at Nerang. A bronze plaque lists the names of the 88 Australians who died in the bombings. An annual twilight service is held at the site of the memorial on each anniversary of the Bali bombings.\n\n===Sydney===\n\nOn the northern side of Coogee Beach a memorial to the Bali bombing victims comprises three interlocking bronze shapes that have an abstract resemblance to three bowed figures supporting each other. There are also some graffiti memorials in memory of the dead.\n\nA memorial to seven residents of Sutherland Shire who were victims is at Cronulla. Called The Seed, the work is based on the seed and foliage of the Banksia robur, a native plant indigenous to the Shire. This sculpture of pink sandstone is the centrepiece of the memorial. It is set in a black granite pond located in 'Peryman Place' not far from North Cronulla Beach, frequented by many of the seven victims and their families. Two plaques are set into the granite surrounding the pond. The plaques carry the victims' photos, names, and ages; and also details of the event, the design's symbolism, its dedication, and a poem written by the families of the victims. The work is by sculptor Chris Bennetts and Ishi Buki Sandstone Sculpture.\n\nSouth of Sydney, in the town of Ulladulla, a large youth centre is being built as a memorial to Craig Dunn and Danny Lewis, two local victims of the bombings. Money is being raised through the Dunn & Lewis Youth Development Foundation.\n\n===Canberra===\nA granite cube serves as a memorial in the Eastern Formal Gardens of Parliament House.\n\n===London===\n\n\nOn the fourth anniversary of the bombings Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall unveiled a memorial in London, at the rear of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Main Building, facing St. James's Park. The memorial consists of a 1.5-metre marble globe, to represent that people from 21 countries were killed, and has 202 doves carved into it. The names of all 202 victims are on a curved stone wall behind the globe. It is the work of the artist Gary Breeze and the sculptor Martin Cook.\n\n===Hong Kong===\nIn 2005, two marble wall placards were unveiled at Hong Kong Football Club in memory of the members of the club who were killed in the bombings.\n\n===Singapore===\nEvery year since 2002, the Rugby Section of the Singapore Cricket Club (the \"SCC\") has held a dawn memorial service on the Padang (the SCC's rugby field in central Singapore) on the anniversary of the bombings, to honour the memory of the eight players which the SCC lost (Neil Bowler, Chris Redman, Dave Kent, Peter Record, Tim Arnold, Chris Bradford, Chris Kays and Charlie Van Rennen). The service is attended by survivors of the 2002 rugby tour to Bali, friends and family of those who lost their lives, as well as current and past players of the club.\n\nThe SCC also maintains a permanent memorial to the players it lost inside the club's main lounge.\n\n===Vietnam===\nA remembrance garden was constructed at the International School Ho Chi Minh City commemorating teachers from that school who were killed in the bombings.\n\n==In media==\n\nIn 2006, Long Road to Heaven, an Indonesian feature film about the bombings, was released by Kalyana Shira Films. The film was directed by Enison Sinaro and written by Wong Wai Leng and Andy Logam-Tan. It stars Raelee Hill, Mirrah Foulkes, Alex Komang, Surya Saputra, John O' Hare, Sarah Treleaven, and Joshua Pandelaki.\n\nIt tells the story during three different times: the planning a few months before the bombing, its execution in 2002, and the trials in 2003 through the viewpoints of both the victims and the bombers. The story is not chronologically linear, starting with the explosion and then moving from time to time so as all three plots are culminated one after the other. At the beginning of each scene, subtitles tell the date and location of the scene.\n\nA 130-page comic book about the first Bali Bombing has been launched to promote peace and discourage radicalism and terrorism in Indonesia. The book, titled Ketika Nurani Bicara (When Conscience Speaks), tells about the bombing from the perspective of three people: a volunteer who helped evacuate a bombing victim who lost her husband in the blast; the victim who struggled to raise her children without her husband; and a terrorist who regrets his involvement in the bombing.\n\nBali Boom Boom, a 2004 p\u043ernographic film, contains amateur footage recorded at Paddy's Pub and Sari Club before and after the bombings, in which several of the performers died. The film's tagline was \"Police couldn't catch us, the terrorist didn't even get us.\"\n\nA Seconds from Disaster episode named \"Bali Bombings\" was a documentary telling the story of what happened, and looking at what happened after the incident.\n\n==See also==\n\n* 2004 Australian Embassy bombing in Jakarta\n* 2005 Bali bombings\n* Bali Mandara Eye Hospital\n* List of terrorist incidents\n* National Geographic Seconds from Disaster episodes\n* Terrorism in Australia\n* Traumascapes\n\n==References==\n\n\n\n==External links==\n*  Remember Bali: a memorial website\n* Australian Broadcasting Corp.

{"title":"Passover massacre","article":"The Passover massacre was a suicide bombing carried out by Hamas at the Park Hotel in Netanya, Israel on 27 March 2002, during a Passover seder. Thirty civilians were killed in the attack and 140 were injured. It was the deadliest attack against Israelis during the Second Intifada.\n\n==The attack==\n\nDuring the Jewish holiday of Passover in 2002, Park Hotel in the Israeli coastal city of Netanya held its traditional annual Passover seder for its 250 guests, in the hotel dining room located at the ground floor of the hotel.\n\nOn the evening of 27 March 2002, a Palestinian bomber, Abdel-Basset Odeh (or Abd Al-Baset Odeh), disguised as a woman approached the hotel carrying a suitcase which contained powerful explosives. The suicide bomber managed to pass the security guard at the entrance to a hotel, then he walked through the lobby passing the reception desk and entered the hotel's crowded dining room.\n\nAt 19:30 (GMT+2) the suicide bomber detonated the explosive device he was carrying. The force of the explosion instantly killed 28 civilians and injured about 140 people, of whom 20 were injured severely. Two of the injured later died from their wounds. Some of the victims were Holocaust survivors.\n\nMost of the victims were senior citizens (70 and over). The oldest victim was 90 and the youngest was 20 years old. A number of married couples were killed, as well as a father together with his daughter. One of the victims was a Jewish tourist from Sweden who was visiting Israel for Passover.\n\nSeventy-three of the 140 injured in the attack were evacuated to Laniado Hospital in neighboring Kiryat Sanz, Netanya. Although established as a regional hospital, Laniado had established a trauma center and emergency protocol in the wake of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks in the Netanya area during the Second Intifada. In addition to medical teams, the hospital benefited from the volunteerism of Hasidim living in Kiryat Sanz, who donated blood, carried stretchers, and otherwise assisted the medical staff.\n\nThe initial plot for the Passover massacre included the use of cyanide; 4\u00a0kg of cyanide had been bought and prepared for a chemical attack. Tarak Zidan had been recruited to Hamas, and during 1997 he researched the use of chlorine and other nerve agents to be used in terror attacks. In 2002, 4\u00a0kg of chlorine had been bought and packed for the attack. For unknown reasons it was not used and passed to Abbas al-Sayyid instead.\n\n==Victims==\n\n\n; Families\n\n* Shula Abramovitch, 63, of Holon\n* David Anichovitch, 70, of Netanya\n* Alter Britvich, 88, of Netanya\n* Frieda Britvich, 86, of Netanya\n* Andre Fried, 47, of Netanya\n* Idit Fried, 47, of Netanya\n* Dvora Karim, 73, of Netanya\n* Michael Karim, 78, of Netanya\n* Eliezer Korman, 74, of Ramat HaSharon\n* Yehudit Korman, 70, of Ramat HaSharon\n* St.-Sgt.

The bomber was identified as Abdel-Basset Odeh (Abd Al-Baset Odeh), a 25-year-old from the nearby West Bank city of Tulkarm. Hamas spokesman Abdel Aziz Rantisi said, \"[a]s long as there is occupation, there will be a resistance\" and denied that the attack was timed to coincide with the peace initiative of the Saudi government at the Beirut Summit, an initiative rejected by Hamas.\n\n==Official reactions==\n; Involved parties\n:\n* Israeli government spokesman Gideon Meir related to the attack saying \"what we had tonight was a Passover massacre\" and added \"There is no limit to Palestinian barbarism.\"\n\n:\n* Palestinian National Authority: Palestinian Authority officials \"strongly condemned\" the attack.\n* During a television broadcast on the Palestinian TV channel, Yasser Arafat praised the Palestinian people for the current popular uprising against Israel, but stressed that \"We are against killing civilians on both sides\".\n*The Zionist Organization of America and Palestinian Media Watch reported that the Palestinian Authority sponsored a soccer tournament named the \"Tulkarm Shahids Memorial soccer championship tournament of the Shahid Abd Al-Baset Odeh\" describing the perpetrator as a \"shahid\" (\"martyr\"), claiming this promotes and glorifies terrorism. 71% of Palestinians polled about this event approved of naming a soccer tournament in honor of the bomber.\n\n; Supranational\n* : Kofi Annan, United Nations Secretary General stated that he condemned suicide bombings against Israeli civilians as morally repugnant.\n\n; International\n* : President of the United States George W. Bush condemned the attack and called on Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian Authority to do everything in their power to stop the terrorist killing.\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Diplomacy===\nIn his response to the Saudi initiative adopted at the Beirut Summit, Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel Shimon Peres noted that \"\u2026 the details of every peace plan must be discussed directly between Israel and the Palestinians, and to make this possible, the Palestinian Authority must put an end to terror, the horrifying expression of which we witnessed just last night in Netanya.\"\n\n===Israeli retaliation===\n\nThe attack was perceived in Israel as the high point of a bloody month in which more than 135 Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed in terror attacks.\n\nFollowing the Passover massacre attack the Israeli government declared a state of emergency, ordered the immediate recruitment of 20,000 reservists in an emergency call-up, and in the following day launched the large-scale counter-terrorism operation Operation Defensive Shield in the West Bank which took place between 29 March and 10 May.\n\nQeis Adwan, head of the suicide bombing network responsible for the massacre, was killed by IDF forces on 5 April 2002 during Operation Defensive Shield, after the IDF and the Yamam caught him in Tubas, some 70 kilometers north of Jerusalem. An armored IDF Caterpillar D9 bulldozer toppled the house where he was hiding, after he was given a chance to surrender and refused.\n\n===Arrests and killings of perpetrators===\nOne of the two chief planners of the attack, Qais Adwan, a Hamas member who was involved in numerous attacks in which a total of 77 people were killed, was killed in a shootout with the IDF during Operation Defensive Shield. In May 2002, Israeli forces arrested the other chief planner, Abbas al-Sayed. On 22 September 2005, al-Sayed was convicted of the Passover attack and also of ordering the May 2001 bombing of a Netanya mall. He received 35 life sentences for each murder victim and additional time for those who were wounded.\n\nFathi Khatib, who transported the bomber to his target, Mohand Sharim, who financed the operation and helped hide the bomber, Muammar Abu Sheikh, who recruited the bomber to Hamas and transferred the explosive belts used in the attack to an explosives expert for examination, and Nasser Yatiya, who helped transport the explosive belts, were tried and convicted together in an Israeli military court in April 2003 and handed 29 life sentences. Nasser Yatiya was released in the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange in 2011. Muhammad Taher, who prepared the explosive charges, was killed in a clash with Israeli Shayetet 13 naval commandos in June 2003.\n\nOn 26 March 2008 Hamas commander Omar Jabar, suspected of helping organize the attack, was arrested in Tulkarem by IDF troops of the Nahshon Battalion.

{"title":"Maritime Jewel","article":"Maritime Jewel was a double-hulled oil tanker launched in 1999 and completed in 2000. Entering service that year, the ship was known as 'MV Limburg' until 2003. The  ship carried crude oil between ports in Iran and Malaysia. On 6 October 2002, Limburg was attacked by suicide bombers, causing roughly  to leak into the Gulf of Aden. One crew member was killed and twelve more wounded in the attack. Four days after the attack, the tanker was towed to Dubai where she was repaired and renamed Maritime Jewel. Maritime Jewel was broken up for scrap at Chittagong, Bangladesh on 15 May 2018.\n\n==Description==\nOrdered as Limburg the vessel was  long overall and  between perpendiculars  with a beam of . The ship's gross tonnage (GT) was 157,833 tons, with a deadweight tonnage (DWT) of 299,364 tons and a net tonnage (NT) of 108,708 tons. The ship was powered by a diesel engine driving one shaft giving the vessel a maximum speed of . \n\n==History==\nLimburgs keel was laid down on 24 May 1999 and the ship was launched on 28 August 1999. Limburg was completed on 5 January 2000 and entered service that year.\n\n===Bombing===\nOn 6 October 2002, Limburg was carrying  of crude oil from Iran to Malaysia, and was in the Gulf of Aden off Yemen to pick up another load of oil. She was registered under a French flag and had been chartered by the Malaysian petrol firm Petronas. While she was some distance offshore, suicide bombers rammed an explosives-laden dinghy into the starboard side of the tanker. Upon detonation the vessel caught fire and approximately  of oil leaked into the Gulf of Aden. Although Yemeni officials initially claimed that the explosion was caused by an accident, later investigations found traces of TNT on the damaged ship.\n\nOne crew member was killed, and twelve other crew members were injured. The fire was extinguished, and four days later Limburg was towed to Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The ship was renamed Maritime Jewel, bought by Tanker Pacific, and repaired at Dubai Drydocks from March to August 2003. The attack caused the short-term collapse of international shipping in the Gulf of Aden and as a result, cost Yemen $3.8 million a month in port revenues.\n\n====Responsibility====\nAl Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attack on the Jehad.net website, which has since been shut down. Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, who allegedly also masterminded the USS Cole bombing, was charged by US military prosecutors for planning the attack. Osama bin Laden issued a statement, which read:\n \n\nOn 3 February 2006, Fawaz Yahya al-Rabeiee, who had been sentenced to death for the Limburg attack, and 22 other suspected or convicted Al-Qaeda members escaped from jail in Yemen. Among them was Jamal al-Badawi, who masterminded the USS Cole bombing of 12 October 2000. Of the 23 escapees, 13 had been convicted of the Cole and Limburg bombings. On 1 October 2006, al-Rabeiee and Mohammed Daylami were shot and killed by Yemeni security forces during raids on two buildings in the capital Sana'a. One of al-Rabeiee's accomplices was also arrested during the raids. In February 2014 Ahmed al-Darbi pleaded guilty before the Guantanamo military commission to helping plan several maritime terrorist attacks including the Limburg attack. By the time of the attack, al-Darbi was already detained at Guantanamo.\n\n===Fate===\nMaritime Jewel was broken up for scrap at Chittagong, Bangladesh on 1 May 2018.\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n*  Yemen ship attack 'was terrorism' (BBC)\n*  \"Interpol issues global alert after Al-Qaeda prison break in Yemen\" (Channelnewsasia)\n*  Repairs post 2002 terrorist attack off Yemen (Google + photo album)","urls":["https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/02\/21\/us\/guantanamo-detainee-ahmed-muhammed-haza-al-darbi.html?_r=0","http:\/\/www.ogi-tm.com\/ogi_threats_st.php","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20070325231204\/http:\/\/www.ogi-tm.com\/ogi_threats_st.php","http:\/\/security.homeoffice.gov.uk\/news-publications\/publication-search\/prevention-terrorism-act-2005\/Paper1?view=Binary","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20080904000721\/http:\/\/security.homeoffice.gov.uk\/news-publications\/publication-search\/prevention-terrorism-act-2005\/Paper1?view=Binary","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/world\/middle_east\/5396862.stm","http:\/\/www.motorship.com\/news101\/industry-news\/dubai-drydocks-continues-its-drive-forward","http:\/\/www.marinelink.com\/news\/drydocks-profile-company324803","http:\/\/www.tkb.org\/documents\/Downloads\/2006-MIPT-Terrorism-Annual.pdf","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20060824072843\/http:\/\/www.tkb.org\/documents\/Downloads\/2006-MIPT-Terrorism-Annual.pdf","https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/worldnews\/middleeast\/saudiarabia\/8879578\/USS-Cole-bombing-mastermind-arraigned-in-Guantanamo.html","https:\/\/wikileaks.org\/plusd\/cables\/05SANAA276_a.html","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/middle_east\/4682214.stm"]}
{"title":"2002 Karachi bus bombing","article":"The 2002 Karachi bus bombing was one of a series of deadly strikes on Westerners in Pakistan in 2002. The blast killed 14 people and wounded another 40. The attack took place in Karachi, Sindh.\n\n== Details ==\nOn May 8, 2002, a man driving a car bomb stopped next to a bus in Karachi outside the Sheraton Hotel. He detonated the car, ripping the bus apart, and killing himself, 11 Frenchmen, and two Pakistanis. The Frenchmen were engineers working with Pakistan to design an Agosta 90B-class submarine for the Pakistani Navy. About 40 others were wounded.\n\nAl-Qaeda was blamed for the blast. On September 18, 2002, a man named Sharib Zubair, who was believed to have masterminded the attack, was arrested. In 2003, two men were sentenced to death for the bombing by a Karachi court. The suspected bombmaker, Mufti Mohammad Sabir, was arrested in Karachi on September 8, 2005. There were several convictions in the case, though Pakistani courts acquitted three defendants by 2009.\n\n==Karachigate==\n\nContrary to official announcements by the Pakistani and the French governments at the time, it is now thought to be unlikely that those responsible for the attack had links to al-Qaeda. In 2007, anti-terrorism judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere, assigned to lead the investigation into the bombing, was replaced by two investigating magistrates, Marc Trevidic and Renaud Van Ruymbeke. The former opened a new line in the investigation: that the attack was linked to the halting of kickback. The resulting scandal has been dubbed \"Karachigate\".\n\nAn investigation is currently underway in France to establish the extent to which former French Prime Minister \u00c9douard Balladur and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy were implicated in the sale of kickbacks to Pakistani officials. Sarkozy was allegedly involved in accepting kickbacks from Pakistan to fund the presidential campaign of Balladur. When Jacques Chirac came to power, he cancelled the Pakistani officials' kickbacks, angering many people in Pakistan.\n\n==See also==\n* Karachi affair\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n* Suicide bomber kills 11 French engineers at Karachi hotel (The Guardian)\n* Timeline: The Karachi bombing and kickback allegations France 24.","urls":["http:\/\/usatoday30.usatoday.com\/news\/world\/2005-09-08-pakistan-militant_x.htm","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/pakistan\/Story\/0,2763,712186,00.html","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/south_asia\/4227734.stm","http:\/\/news.dawn.com\/wps\/wcm\/connect\/dawn-content-library\/dawn\/the-newspaper\/local\/karachi-man-acquitted-in-frenchmen-killing-case-109","http:\/\/www.france24.com\/en\/20101118-karachi-bombing-pakistan-submarine-sales-timeline-france-sarkozy-villepin-chirac-justice-corruption-mediapart-luxembour","https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/europe\/villepin-backs-karachigate-claims-against-sarkozy-2140321.html","http:\/\/www.france24.com\/en\/20101122-submarines-subtext-who-who-karachigate-affair-sarkozy-balladur-chirac-corruption-pakistan-france-justice"]}

{"title":"2002 Grozny truck bombing","article":"The Grozny truck bombing occurred on December 27, 2002, when three Chechen suicide bombers ran vehicles into the heavily guarded republic's government headquarters in the regional capital Grozny.\n\n== Details ==\nThe drivers of two vehicles reportedly wore federal military uniforms and carried official passes which allowed them through three successive military checkpoints on their way to the headquarters building. A guard at the fourth and final checkpoint attempted to inspect the vehicles, and began firing on the vehicles as they drove through the checkpoint towards the building.\n\nThe explosion by the equivalent of a ton of dynamite brought down the roof and floors of the four-story building. The first reports said of as few as two dead. Ultimately, Chechen officials said 83 people were killed (48 on the spot) and 210 were injured. Several Chechen administration officials were injured in the attack, including Deputy Prime Minister Zina Batyzheva (seriously wounded) and Chechen Security Council Secretary Rudnik Dudayev. The head of the pro-Russian administration in Chechnya, Akhmad Kadyrov, and his Prime Minister, Mikhail Babich, were not in the building at the time.\n\n== Responsibility ==\n\nColonel Ilya Shabalkin, spokesman for the joint federal forces in Chechnya, said the bombing was organized by Chechen rebel field commanders Abu al-Walid and Shamil Basayev. Basayev claimed responsibility for the planning and execution of the attack, saying that he personally detonated the bomb by remote control.\n\nSome news reports called the attack an act of terrorism, which with 83 confirmed fatalities, would have been the deadliest terrorist attack in Chechnya.

{"title":"Yeshivat Beit Yisrael massacre","article":"The Yeshivat Beit Yisrael massacre was a Palestinian suicide bombing which occurred in the Beit Yisrael neighborhood in downtown Jerusalem on March 2, 2002. Eleven Israeli civilians were killed in the attack, including two infants, three children and two teenagers. Over 50 people were injured in the attack, four of them critically. The bombing took place at the entrance of the Haredi yeshiva \"Beit Yisrael\" in central Jerusalem where people had gathered for a bar mitzvah celebration. The suicide bomber detonated the bomb full of shrapnel alongside a group of women with their baby strollers, waiting for the services in a nearby synagogue to conclude. The Palestinian militant organization al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\n==The attack==\n\nThe bombing took place on Saturday evening in the Haredi Beit Yisrael neighborhood of Jerusalem, a neighborhood that had been targeted in three previous attacks.\n\nShortly after 7\u00a0PM, the streets were crowded with worshippers who had just finished the sun-down prayers that mark the conclusion of the Shabbat. People had gathered near the Mahane Yisrael yeshiva for the bar mitzvah of Naveh Hazan. Another family, the Hajabis, were also celebrating their son's bar mitzvah, and members of the related Nehmad and Ilan families had arrived in Jerusalem for the celebration.  Upwards of 1,000 Jews prayed every Saturday evening at the Mahane Israel seminary.\n\nThe bomber was standing alongside a group of women with baby carriages who were waiting for their husbands to return from the synagogue, and blew himself up just as the family and guests were beginning to leave. The ensuing blast shook downtown Jerusalem, and ignited a nearby car. Among the dead were an infant and her six-year-old brother, a mother and her three-year-old son, and a 12-year-old boy. The dead included members of the Hajabi, Hazan, Nehmad, and Ilan families. A woman who was pregnant with twins survived but lost both of her unborn children. Two babies were taken to Hadassah Medical Center, the whereabouts of their parents unknown.\n\nThe bombing occurred only meters from the site of a previous car bombing the year before. At the Mahane Yisrael seminary, a stone wall was splattered in blood.\n\nShlomi, an eyewitness, saw a baby carriage alongside a dead baby and other dead people. Another witness said that she and everyone else in her family had been injured when the bomber attacked:\n\n\n\nEitan of the Magen David Adom recounted:\n\n\n\nLivnat, the sister of Sofia Ya'arit Eliyahu who died in the blast with her seven-month-old son, described her experience:\n\n\n\n==Fatalities==\nTen people were killed instantly in the attack, and an eleventh died later of his injuries. Over 50 people were injured.\nEight of those killed were from the Nehmad family. Ziva's brother Shlomi Nehmad, his wife Gafnit, and their young children Shiraz and Liran were killed in the attack. Shlomi's teenage nephew Shaul Nehmad was also killed, and his brother Avraham Eliahu died later of his injuries after losing an arm.\n\nRonit Ilan, sister of Shlomi Nehmad, and her husband Shimon were standing outside of Mahane Israel. With them were their two children: A 12-year-old boy, Lidor, and their 18-month-old daughter, Oriah, who was being held in her father's arms. The explosion sent the baby girl flying into the air, and both children died. Shimon Ilan's legs were injured in the attack. He was released from hospital in a wheelchair to attend his children's funerals. In his eulogy for the Nehmad family, Health Minister Nissim Dahan said: \"They cut off the most beautiful flowers before their time was due.\"\n\n==Perpetrators==\nThe al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, the armed wing of Fatah, claimed responsibility and said the attack was to avenge the deaths of 19 Palestinians killed during Israeli military incursions into the Balata and Jenin refugee camps earlier in the week. The bomber was identified as 19-year-old Mohammed al-Chouhani from the Dheisheh refugee camp near Bethlehem. Around 1,500 Palestinians celebrated through the camp handing out sweets and shooting in the air.\n\n==Official reactions==\n;Involved parties\n:\n* The Israeli government sources said they would hold Yasser Arafat was personally responsible, as the Al-Aqsa Brigades were under his control.\n* Tzipi Livni said, \"the difference between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, and between Israelis and Palestinians, is that terrorists are deliberately targeting civilians, and you will never find that in what the IDF forces are doing.\"\n\n:\n* The PA cabinet criticized the attack, though stating that Israel was responsible for the escalation of the violence.\n* Hundreds of Palestinians celebrated on hearing the news and took to the streets firing guns into the air.\n* Marwan Barghouti, a leader in the Fatah movement promised that his organization would continue the attacks on Israel. \"The resistance forces will continue to strike at the Zionist enemy and I am certain that the force of these strikes will even increase.\"\n\n; Supranational\n* \u2013 United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson expressed her shock and horror and said, \"Acts of suicide bombings in Israel harm the interests and aspirations of the Palestinian people because they undermine support for the cause of self-determination and the fight against occupation.\"\n\n; International\n* \u2013 The US State Department harshly condemned this \"terrorist outrage\". \"Such murder of innocent citizens cannot be justified and can only harm the interests and aspirations of the Palestinian people in progress toward a better future ... We call upon Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority to do everything possible to confront and stop the terrorists responsible for these criminal acts.\"\n\n==Burials==\n\nThe Nehamad family were buried in Rishon Letzion. The Israeli Health Minister, Nissim Dahan, said of the dead: \"They cut off the most beautiful flowers before their time was due.\" The eulogies expressed feelings of bitterness and anger. Sofia Ya'arit Eliyahu, 23, and her seven-month-old son, Avraham Eliyahu were buried at Moshav Noam.\n\n== External links ==\n*  Suicide bombing in the Beit Yisrael neighborhood in Jerusalem, 2 March 2002 \u2013 published at the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n*  In Jerusalem, Suicide Bomber Kills at Least 9 \u2013 published on 3 March 2002 in the New York Times\n*  UN rights chief Robinson says shocked by Jerusalem bombing \u2013 published on 4 March 2002 in Ha'aretz\n\n==See also==\n\n* Civilian casualties in the Second Intifada\n* Israeli casualties of war\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=qxzvAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA63","https:\/\/pqasb.pqarchiver.com\/baltsun\/access\/110027997.html?dids=110027997:110027997&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/MFAArchive\/2000_2009\/2002\/3\/Suicide%20bombing%20in%20the%20Beit%20Yisrael%20neighborhood%20i","http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/print-edition\/news\/9-dead-51-hurt-in-jerusalem-bombing-1.51487","http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/print-edition\/news\/focus-jerusalem-s-soft-underbelly-1.51476","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/03\/03\/world\/in-jerusalem-suicide-bomber-kills-at-least-9.html","http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/print-edition\/news\/mother-and-infant-son-laid-to-rest-1.51418","http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/print-edition\/news\/seven-funerals-for-the-nehmad-family-1.51438","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/middle_east\/1851747.stm","http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/news\/un-rights-chief-robinson-says-shocked-by-jerusalem-bombing-1.51414"]}

{"title":"2002 French Hill suicide bombing","article":"The 2002 French hill suicide bombing was a suicide bombing which occurred on June 19, 2002, in a crowded bus stop and hitchhiking post at the French Hill neighborhood in northeastern Jerusalem. The site of the attack was chosen in order to cause a maximum number of casualties. Seven people were killed in the attack, and 35 were injured.\n\nThe Palestinian militant group Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe attack took place only a day after the deadliest bombing attack in Jerusalem in six years occurred, in which a Palestinian suicide bomber killed 19 people on a crowded bus in southern Jerusalem. According to the Daily Telegraph, both of the attacks were timed to disrupt an expected announcement by U.S. President George W. Bush regarding a future Palestinian state, and Bush did in fact delay his speech.\n\n== The attack ==\nOn Wednesday, shortly after 7:05 pm, a Palestinian suicide bomber got out of a red Audi vehicle next to a bus station in Jerusalem's French Hill neighborhood.\n\nBecause the bus stop had been targeted by assailants in the past, the bus stop was heavily guarded. Two Border Police patrolmen, who were securing the site, chased the suspect to try to stop him, but the suicide bomber managed to run past them straight into the middle of a crowd of people waiting for the bus in one of the busiest bus stops in Israel. The suicide bomber detonated the explosive device that he was holding in a bag, killing seven people. About 50 additional people were injured from the force of the blast and by shrapnel that was packed around the explosive device. Eight of the wounded sustained severe injuries.\n\nThe force of the blast completely destroyed the bus station, which was made of concrete, and many body parts were scattered over a large area throughout the street near the bus station. Later, a bulldozer dismantled what was left of the concrete bus station.\n\nThe two Border Police patrolmen at the scene were wounded in the attack, one of them seriously.\n\n== The perpetrators ==\nShortly after the attack, the Palestinian militant group Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, which publicly identifies itself as the military wing of Fatah (led at the time by Yasser Arafat), claimed responsibility for the attack during a broadcast on Lebanese television.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAccording to the Daily Telegraph, both attacks carried out in Jerusalem on the 18th and 19 June 2002 were timed to disrupt an expected announcement by U.S. President George W. Bush regarding a future Palestinian state, provided that the Palestinian Authority first met a series of strict conditions. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer stated that Bush would delay the plan as such, because \"It's obvious that the immediate aftermath is not the right time.\"\n\n=== Israeli response ===\nIn response to the attack, three hours after the attack took place, Israeli Air Force helicopters fired rockets at metal workshops in the Gaza Strip which were used to manufacture weapons. According to Reuters, at least five rockets were shot in Gaza City and Khan Yunis.\n\n== Official reactions ==\n;Involved parties\n:\n* Israeli government spokesman Arye Mekel referred to the attack, noting that \"It is another carnage, another brutal attack on innocent people who were standing, waiting for a bus\".\n\n:\n* The Palestinian Authority condemned the attack. An official statement issued said, the PA \"reiterates its condemnation and denunciation\" of \"all operations against Israeli civilians.\"\n* Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat released a statement after the attack, which he wrote in Arabic, in which he called on Palestinians to completely stop attacks against Israelis, noting that \"Targeting civilians, whether they are Israelis or Palestinians, is a deplorable act\" and noting that these attacks are not a \"legitimate resistance\" to Israeli occupation and that Israel uses them as an excuse to invade the Palestinian territories.\n\n== See also ==\n* French Hill attacks\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n*  Bombings spark Mid-East turmoil - published on BBC News on June 20, 2002\n*  Bomb kills 8 in Jerusalem ; Attack is 2nd in 2 days; troops move in West Bank - published on Chicago Tribune on June 20, 2002","urls":["http:\/\/transcripts.cnn.com\/TRANSCRIPTS\/0206\/19\/bn.03.html","https:\/\/pqasb.pqarchiver.com\/nypost\/access\/127319321.html?dids=127319321:127319321&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2002\/1\/Gal%20Eisenman","https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/1397733\/Suicide-bomber-kills-seven.html","http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/news\/two-killed-in-suicide-attack-at-french-hill-in-jerusalem-1.135407","http:\/\/www.voanews.com\/content\/a-13-a-2002-06-19-10-7-66492927\/552737.html","http:\/\/archives.cnn.com\/2002\/WORLD\/meast\/06\/19\/mideast.diplomacy\/index.html","http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/stories\/2002\/06\/19\/national\/main512766.shtml","http:\/\/www.vg.no\/nyheter\/utenriks\/artikkel.php?artid=9551184","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/middle_east\/2054969.stm","https:\/\/news.google.com\/newspapers?id=YWZWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tPIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5674,6716777","https:\/\/news.google.com\/newspapers?id=gKM_AAAAIBAJ&sjid=Q1YMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6604,8967254","http:\/\/www.mako.co.il\/news-specials\/today-in-history\/Article-d20fa7d98910831018.htm","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=rb6tVjFLAtMC&pg=PA238&lpg=PA238","https:\/\/news.google.com\/newspapers?id=EL4aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9EEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3193,7615854","http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/magazine\/article\/0,9171,265414,00.html","http:\/\/archives.cnn.com\/2002\/WORLD\/meast\/06\/19\/mideast\/index.html","http:\/\/nl.newsbank.com\/nl-search\/we\/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=BBAB&d_place=BBAB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F97854C1C77048B&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10","http:\/\/archives.cnn.com\/2002\/WORLD\/meast\/06\/19\/arafat.statement\/"]}

{"title":"Netanya Market bombing","article":"The Netanya Market bombing was a suicide bombing which occurred on May 19, 2002 at the entrance to the main fruit and vegetable open-air market in Netanya. The site of the attack was chosen in order to cause maximum number of casualties. Three people were killed in the attack, and 56\u201359 were injured.\n\n==Background==\nNetanya has been a frequent target of Palestinian suicide bombers. A prior attack on March 27, 2002 at the Park hotel in Netanya killed 29 people during the Jewish Passover Seder and triggered Operation Defensive Shield, a large Israeli military offensive in the West Bank.\n\n==The attack==\n\nOn Sunday, May 19, 2002, during the afternoon hours, a Palestinian suicide bomber disguised as an IDF soldier managed to slip through several police checkpoints with the assistance of a female collaborator. The suicide bomber who wore an explosive belt hidden underneath his clothes, packed with nails and bolts, and detonated the explosive device at the entrance to the main open market of the Israeli coastal city of Netanya. The blast killed three innocent civilians and injured 56 people, among them at least 10 in severe condition.\n\nTwo Palestinian militant groups, Hamas and the PFLP, claimed responsibility for the attack. The attack is thought to have been carried out by the PFLP's Abu Ali Mustapha Brigades.\n\nThe PFLP said the attack purpose was to protest the  detention of the group's leader, Ahmad Saadat, by the Palestinian Authority in connection with the PFLP assassination of the Israeli tourism minister Rehavam Ze'evi.\n\n===Fatalities===\n* Arkady Vieselman, 39, of Netanya\n* Victor Tatrinov, 62, of Netanya\n* Yosef Haviv, 70, of Netanya\n\n==Subsequent related events==\n\nLawsuits were filed against Arab Bank, NatWest and Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais for channeling money to Hamas.\n\nIn response to the attack Israeli army forces conducted several operational activities in the towns of Tulkarm and Ramallah in the West Bank for a relatively short period time during the late Sunday, though there was no major Israeli retaliation for the Netanya Market bombing.\n\nAfter the attack the Israeli defense establishment stated that the attack was ordered by the head of the PFLP Ahmed Saadat from his cell in the PA-run Jericho Prison, under U.S. and British supervision. They also found that the suicide bomber managed to reach the market in Netanya with the assistance of another person who drove him there.\n\nLater on it was revealed that the driver was Adel Adnan Mahmoud Jumaa, a resident of Taybeh, who admitted  that he had driven the suicide-bomber and a woman collaborator to Netanya. The woman was Da'a Jiusi, a 21-year-old Palestinian female student from the Palestinian city Tulkarem who later on confessed that she was asked to accompany the suicide bomber provide cover as an innocent-looking couple.\n\nIn addition, after the attack Israeli officials revealed that the Israeli security forces received an actual warning about the attack 20 minutes before the suicide bomber detonated his explosive device but added that at that point they were powerless from stopping him.\n\nOn June 30, 2003 an Israeli Military Court sentenced Da'a Jiusi to three life sentences plus 30 years in prison. Jiusi was convicted of leading a suicide bomber to explode in a civilian market. Another man, Alam Kabi from Nablus, was sentenced in 2004 to nine life sentences, for dispatching the suicide bomber who perpetrated the Netanya Market bombing, along with several other attacks.\n\n=== Jiwasi's Release ===\n\nOn October 18, 2011 Jiwasi Ziyad Dawa'a, who was originally sentenced to 3 life sentences, was released to the West Bank as part of the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange between Israel and Hamas.\n\n==Official reactions==\n;Involved parties\n: Immediately after the attack in Netanya, Israeli officials stated that Israeli government was unlikely to launch a broad military operation in retaliation to the terror attack. Instead, they stated that Israeli military forces would continue to carry out targeted raids against armed Palestinian militants.\n\n: PNA officials issued a statement declaring \"full condemnation for the terror attack that targeted Israeli civilians.\"\n\n; International\n:\n* U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney called on Yasser Arafat to crack down on Palestinian militant armed groups but added that \"there clearly is a class of bombings that he can't rein in\". Cheney also stated that the United States plans to send CIA Director George Tenet to the region to assist the security forces of Arafat in targeting the militant organizations.\n* National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice stated that the attack underlined the need of the Palestinians leadership in creating \"a unified security apparatus that can be accountable and can deal with issues of terrorism.\"\n: British Foreign Office spokesman has stated that the UK has asked Israel to provide evidence that Ahmed Saadat, the head of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), gave a green light for the attack in the Netanya Market bombing while held by British and American warders in the West Bank city of Jericho.\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n*  Israel blast kills 3, wounds at least 50 \u2013 published on USA Today on May 21, 2002\n*  Suicide bomber kills 3 Israelis, injures 56 \u2013 published on CNN on May 19, 2002\n*  Bomb shatters Israeli calm \u2013 published on BBC News on May 19, 2002\n*  http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/stories\/2002\/05\/19\/world\/main509509.shtml \u2013 published on CBS News on May 19, 2002\n*  Three killed, 56 injured in suicide attack in Netanya \u2013 published on Haaretz on May 19, 2002\n*  Do Female suicide bombers go through a less thorough examination? \u2013 published on ynet on May 19, 2002 (Hebrew)\n*  Israeli Market Bombed; At Least 3 Killed In Suicide Attack \u2013 published on the Washington Post on May 20, 2002\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetanya's open-air market, 2010.","urls":["http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/MFAArchive\/2000_2009\/2003\/1\/The%20Role%20of%20Palestinian%20Women%20in%20Suicide%20Terrorism","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2002\/2\/Arkady%20Vieselman","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2002\/2\/Victor+Tatrinov.htm","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2002\/2\/Yosef%20Haviv","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2006\/04\/15\/nyregion\/15hamas.html?pagewanted=all","http:\/\/www.taipeitimes.com\/News\/front\/archives\/2002\/05\/21\/0000136935","https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/news\/world\/2002\/05\/21\/usat-israel.htm","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/middle_east\/1999032.stm","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/middle_east\/1997672.stm","http:\/\/news.walla.co.il\/?w=%2F21%2F407218","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20120319052038\/http:\/\/news.walla.co.il\/?w=%2F21%2F407218","http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/news\/palestinians-2-people-killed-18-hurt-in-idf-operation-in-gaza-1.121949","http:\/\/www.shabas.gov.il\/NR\/rdonlyres\/09ED13AD-30EB-4F28-8FEA-7A9EDB0F9119\/0\/listeng1.xls","https:\/\/pqasb.pqarchiver.com\/washingtonpost\/access\/120590391.html?dids=120590391:120590391&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/middle_east\/1997672.stm","https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/newshour\/updates\/mideast_05-20-02.html","http:\/\/articles.nydailynews.com\/2002-05-20\/news\/18192876_1_israeli-army-uniform-west-bank-netanya","http:\/\/articles.baltimoresun.com\/2002-05-20\/news\/0205200024_1_israeli-soldier-palestinian-west-bank","http:\/\/www.ynet.co.il\/articles\/0,7340,L-1899809,00.html","http:\/\/www.ynet.co.il\/articles\/0,7340,L-3101470,00.html","http:\/\/archives.cnn.com\/2002\/WORLD\/meast\/05\/19\/mideast.blast\/index.html","http:\/\/laad.btl.gov.il\/show_item.asp?itemId=39809&levelId=28553&itemType=10&template=3","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20120321134823\/http:\/\/laad.btl.gov.il\/show_item.asp?itemId=39809&levelId=28553&itemType=10&template=3","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=U3En3Uz5ACQC&pg=PA539","http:\/\/nl.newsbank.com\/nl-search\/we\/Archives?p_product=PD&s_site=twincities&p_multi=SP&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F3AD51F90B8E1B1&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM"]}
{"title":"Bat Mitzvah massacre","article":"The Bat Mitzvah massacre was a terrorist attack in Hadera, Israel, on Thursday, January 17, 2002, in which a Palestinian gunman, 24-year-old Abdul Salaam Sadek Hassouneh, killed six people and wounded 33 at a Bat Mitzvah celebration, a traditional Jewish celebration held for a 12-year-old girl.\n\n==Attack==\nThe attack took place at 9:45 pm (GMT+2) as guests were departing. The al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades  assumed responsibility for the attack, claiming it was vengeance for the killing of its leader Raed Karmi.

{"title":"2002 Herzliya shawarma restaurant bombing","article":"The 2002 Herzliya shawarma restaurant bombing took place on June 11, 2002 when a Palestinian suicide bomber set off a bomb at the Jamil (Mifgash Ha'Sharon) restaurant in the Israeli beach suburb of Herzliya. The event resulted in the death of one teenager, Hadar Hershkowitz, and the injury of 15 people. The attack led Israel to lodge a formal complaint with the UN security council, citing it as evidence for a \"campaign of Palestinian terrorism\" against Israeli civilians.\n\n==The attack==\nAt about 7:30 PM, a Palestinian suicide bomber set off a pipe bomb in the Shawarma restaurant \"Mifgash Ha'Sharon\" (AKA \"Jamil\"), where about 30 people were sitting. The pipe bomb used in the attack was said to have been \"relatively small.\" A rescue worker said that one of the explosive devices the bomber was wearing did not detonate. According to Israel, the explosives had been packed with nails and ball bearings. A 14-year-old girl was killed in the attack and 15 additional people were injured in the attack.\n\nAccording to Israeli sources, earlier that day, three Israeli high school students were injured when Palestinian militants attacked their school bus. One student was seriously injured. That same day, a Palestinian militant stabbed an Israeli policeman in Jerusalem.\n\n===Fatalities===\n* Hadar Hershkowitz, 14, of Herzliya \u2013 the daughter of the director-general of the Hapoel Tel Aviv Football Club, Aryeh Hershkowitz. Hershkowitz was to have graduated from junior high school the next day. She was brought to hospital in a very serious condition, and later died from her injuries.\n\n== The perpetrators ==\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, a military wing of Fatah,  claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that it was \"in retaliation for the daily incursions by the occupation forces against the cities, towns, villages and refugee camps\". The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades spokesman stated that the suicide bomber was a 30-year-old Palestinian named Omar Zayadeh who originated from the Palestinian village of Ma'adama in the West Bank.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIn 2003, Israeli troops demolished the home of bomber.\n\nAccording to Palestinian Media Watch, an Israel-based media watchdog organization, in 2010 the Palestinian Authority built a monument honoring the bomber in the town square of the West Bank  town of Madama.   The monument, in the form of a pyramid, features portraits of Yasser Arafat and of the bomber.  Below the bomber's portrait are the words, \"The heroic Shahada \u2013 Seeker (Martyrdom- Seeker) Omar Muhammad Ziyada (Abu Samed) who carried out the heroic Herzliya operation on June 11, 2002.\"\n\n==Official reactions==\n;Involved parties\n: David Baker, an official in Sharon's office, condemned the attack as \"another example of the Palestinians' intention to commit murder for the sake of murder\".\n\n:\n* Palestinian National Authority: PA officials condemned the attack, stating it was wrong to attack innocent people on the street. In the statement, the authority said it would do its \"utmost\" to prevent future attacks.\n* Senior Hamas officials said the attack is \"a natural response to Israel's crimes in the territories.\"\n\n== See also ==\n* 2006 Tel Aviv shawarma restaurant bombing\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/articles.cnn.com\/2002-06-11\/world\/mideast_1_palestinian-security-sources-israeli-military-sources-abdul-rahim-mallouh?_s=PM:WORLD","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20121010200413\/http:\/\/articles.cnn.com\/2002-06-11\/world\/mideast_1_palestinian-security-sources-israeli-military-sources-abdul-rahim-mallouh?_s=PM:WORLD","http:\/\/palwatch.org\/main.aspx?fi=157&doc_id=2816","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/06\/13\/world\/mideast-turmoil-ramallah-israelis-pull-back-from-arafat-compound.html?pagewanted=2","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2002\/1\/Hadar+Hershkowitz.htm","http:\/\/www.undemocracy.com\/A-56-983.pdf","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20121021195900\/http:\/\/www.undemocracy.com\/A-56-983.pdf","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2002\/1\/Hadar%20Hershkowitz","http:\/\/info.jpost.com\/C002\/Supplements\/CasualtiesOfWar\/2002_06_11.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110612040833\/http:\/\/info.jpost.com\/C002\/Supplements\/CasualtiesOfWar\/2002_06_11.html","http:\/\/www.albawaba.com\/news\/al-aqsa-martyrs-brigades-claims-responsibility-herzliya-attack-70-year-old-palestinian-killed-s","http:\/\/www.aawsat.com\/details.asp?section=4&article=108253&issueno=8599","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20120401135016\/http:\/\/www.aawsat.com\/details.asp?section=4&article=108253&issueno=8599","http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/news\/idf-kills-palestinian-in-w-bank-1.23581","http:\/\/www.iol.co.za\/news\/world\/injured-teen-dies-after-suicide-bombing-1.87992","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/cbbcnews\/hi\/world\/newsid_2040000\/2040649.stm"]}
{"title":"Canal Hotel bombing","article":"The Canal Hotel bombing was a suicide truck bombing in Baghdad, Iraq, in the afternoon of August 19, 2003. It killed at least 22 people, including the United Nations' Special Representative in Iraq S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello, and wounded over 100, including prominent human rights lawyer and political activist Amin Mekki Medani. The blast targeted the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq created just 5 days earlier. (The United Nations had used the hotel as its headquarters in Iraq since the early 1990s.) \nThat 19 August bombing resulted in the withdrawal within weeks of most of the 600 UN staff members from Iraq. These events were to have a profound and lasting impact on the UN's security practices globally.\n\nThe attack was followed by a suicide car bomb attack on 22 September 2003 near U.N. headquarters in Baghdad, killing a security guard and wounding 19 people.\n\nAbu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of terrorist organization Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad, in April 2004 claimed responsibility for the 19 August blast.\n\n==The bombing==\nIn his book The Prince of the Marshes, British politician and writer Rory Stewart recounts his experiences at the Canal Hotel on the day of the bombing.\n\n\nThe explosion occurred while Martin Barber, director of the UN's Mine Action Service (UNMAS), was holding a press conference. The explosion damaged a spinal cord treatment center at the hospital next door and a U.S. Army Civil-Military Operations Centre located at the rear of the Canal Hotel, and the resulting shockwave was felt over a mile away.\n\n The blast was caused by a suicide bomber driving a truck bomb. The vehicle has been identified as a large 2002 flatbed Kamaz (manufactured in Eastern Europe and part of the former Iraqi establishment's fleet). Investigators in Iraq suspected the bomb was made from old munitions, including a single 500-pound aerial bomb, from Iraq's pre-war arsenal.\n\nThe OCHA Humanitarian Information Centre (HIC) for Iraq (UNOHCI) was located directly beneath the office of S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and suffered a direct hit. Of the eight staff and one visitor in the office at the time, seven were killed instantly, but S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello and Gil Loescher were critically wounded and trapped in debris under the collapsed portion of the building. An American soldier\u00a0\u2013 First Sergeant William von Zehle\u00a0\u2013 crawled down through the collapsed building and worked to extricate the two men. He was joined later by another American soldier\u00a0\u2013 Staff Sergeant Andre Valentine\u00a0\u2013 and the two men spent the next three hours trying to extricate the two survivors without benefit of any rescue equipment.  Loescher was rescued after having his crushed legs amputated by the soldiers, but Vieira de Mello died before he would have been able to have been removed.\n\nAccording to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, de Mello was specifically targeted in the blast. The reason given by al-Zarqawi for targeting de Mello was that he had helped East Timor become an independent state (see the Indonesian occupation of East Timor). Zarqawi said that de Mello had participated in the unlawful removal of territory from the Islamic Caliphate and was therefore a thief and a criminal.\n\n==Second bomb==\nThe bombing was followed on September 22, 2003, by another car bomb outside the Canal Hotel. The blast killed the bomber and an Iraqi policeman and wounded 19 others, including UN workers. The second attack led to the withdrawal of some 600 UN international staff from Baghdad, along with employees of other aid agencies. In August 2004, de Mello's replacement, Ashraf Qazi, arrived in Baghdad along with a small number of staff.\n\n== List of victims ==\n\n\n\nMarilyn Manuel, a member of Vieira de Mello's staff from the Philippines, was originally listed as missing and presumed dead in the collapsed section of the building.  However, she had been evacuated to an Iraqi hospital which did not notify the UN of her presence.  Her survival was confirmed four days later.\n\n\n\n==Suspects==\n\nIn an audiotape, published 6 April 2004 on a Web site and \"probably authentic\" according to CIA, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi claimed credit for a number of attacks, including this 19 August 2003 bombing on U.N. quarters in Baghdad.\n\nBy December 2004, also\nThe Jamestown Foundation considered Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and his Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad responsible for this attack.\nIn February 2006, TV program FRONTLINE. presented an audio tape of Zarqawi\u2014possibly the tape of April 2004\u2014in which Zarqawi motivated the bombing of the UN building: U.N. = \"protectors of Jews (given them Palestine so they can rape the land and humiliate our people) and friends of the (American) oppressors\".\n\nIn January 2005, a top bombmaker for Zarqawi's group, Abu Omar al-Koordi, was captured by the coalition and claimed his associates made the bomb used in this attack. On December 16, 2005, Iraqi authorities issued an arrest warrant for Mullah Halgurd al-Khabir, a commander of Ansar al-Sunna, in connection with the attack.\n\nThe Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera identified the suicide bomber as Algerian national Fahdal Nassim. Other suspects included Baathists, militant Sunni and Shiite groups, organized crime,  and tribal elements. Blame was initially thought to lie with Ansar al-Islam, which was thought at the time to be Zarqawi's group.  An otherwise unknown group called the \"Armed Vanguards of the Second Mohammed Army\" claimed they were responsible for the attack.\n\nAwraz Abd Aziz Mahmoud Sa'eed, known as al-Kurdi, has confessed to helping plan the attack for Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi. Al-Kurdi was captured by U.S. forces in 2005, judged and sentenced to death by an Iraqi court and executed by hanging on July 3, 2007.\n\n==Responses==\n\nThe suicide bombing of the United Nations in Baghdad drew overwhelming condemnation. Kofi Annan, United Nations Secretary-General, commented that the bombing would not stop the organization's efforts to rebuild Iraq, and said: \"Nothing can excuse this act of unprovoked and murderous violence against men and women who went to Iraq for one purpose only: to help the Iraqi people recover their independence and sovereignty, and to rebuild their country as fast as possible, under leaders of their own choosing.\"\n\nHowever, since this event the UN country team's expatriates and leaders relocated in Amman (Jordan) and continued to work remotely. Only some Iraqis have continued under drastic security measures all around the country (except in Kurdistan where they are more numerous and can move more freely). Few expatriates are, 5 years later, authorized to go inside Iraq (including Kurdistan) and only inside huge security compounds such as the so-called \"Green Zone\" in Baghdad. Humanitarian support is now entirely conducted inside the country by NGOs, under UN remote supervision.\n\nIn 2004, Gil Loescher's daughter, documentary filmmaker Margaret Loescher, made a critically acclaimed film about her father's experiences called Pulled from the Rubble.\n\n==The World Humanitarian Day==\nOn 11 December 2008, the United Nations General Assembly made history when it adopted the Swedish sponsored GA Resolution A\/63\/139 on the Strengthening of the Coordination of Emergency Assistance of the United Nations, that amongst other important humanitarian decisions, decided to designate 19 August as the World Humanitarian Day (WHD). The Resolution gives for the first time, a special recognition to all humanitarian and United Nations and associated personnel who have worked in the promotion of the humanitarian cause and those who have lost their lives in the cause of duty and urges all Member States, entities of the United Nations within existing resources, as well as the other International Organizations and Non-Governmental Organizations to observe it annually in an appropriate way. It marks the day on which the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General to Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello and his 21 colleagues were killed following the bombing of the UN Headquarters in Baghdad.\n\n==See also==\n*Attacks on humanitarian workers\n*World Humanitarian Day\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n==External links==\n* United Nations portal for the anniversary\n**\u00a0 Kofi Annan's statement on the one-year anniversary\n** who.int  Senior WHO official, Dr David Nabarro, describes his experience inside the Canal Hotel\n**\u00a0 on the bombing, Oct. 22, 2003\n**  \"Voices of Terrorism Victims\" UN in Action No. 1579, a video interview with Laura Dolci whose husband was killed in the bombing; from UN Web TV's UN in Action\n*\u00a0 March 3, 2004 Report of the Security in Iraq Accountability Panel (SIAP)\n* GlobalSecurity.org The Canal Hotel UN Headquarters Compound\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nUnited Nations members prepare to load flag-draped metal transfer cases carrying the remains of bombing victims from the UN Office of Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq (UNOHCI).\nU.S. officers secure a United Nations flag over the transfer case of S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello, prior to a memorial service at the Baghdad International Airport.\nAfter the 2003 invasion of Iraq American Marines occupied the building.","urls":["http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/middle_east\/6941560.stm","https:\/\/www.un.org\/apps\/news\/infocusnews.asp?NewsID=597&sID=1","https:\/\/www.un.org\/apps\/news\/story.asp?NewsID=11679&Cr=19&Cr1=August","http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/stories\/2003\/09\/22\/iraq\/main574491.shtml","http:\/\/articles.cnn.com\/2004-04-07\/world\/zarqawi.tape_1_al-zarqawi-zarqawi-organization-abu-musab-zarqawi?_s=PM:WORLD","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20121003001701\/http:\/\/articles.cnn.com\/2004-04-07\/world\/zarqawi.tape_1_al-zarqawi-zarqawi-organization-abu-musab-zarqawi?_s=PM%3AWORLD","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/princeofmarshes00stew\/page\/101","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/princeofmarshes00stew\/page\/101","http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/stories\/2003\/08\/21\/iraq\/main569431.shtml","http:\/\/www.reliefweb.int\/ocha_ol\/pub\/ochanews\/ON%20Special%20Issue-Iraq.PDF","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110716065428\/http:\/\/www.blacktriangle.org\/blog\/?p=1687","http:\/\/www.slate.com\/id\/2127343\/","http:\/\/www.news24.com\/News24\/World\/Iraq\/0,,2-10-1460_1572740,00.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20061020053654\/http:\/\/www.news24.com\/News24\/World\/Iraq\/0,,2-10-1460_1572740,00.html","http:\/\/www.reliefweb.int\/library\/documents\/2003\/un-irq-20oct.pdf","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2003\/08\/23\/nyregion\/first-terrible-news-then-a-call-from-iraq-brings-joy.html","https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/wgbh\/pages\/frontline\/insurgency\/etc\/script.html","http:\/\/www.jamestown.org\/publications_details.php?volume_id=400&&issue_id=3179","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20070930185929\/http:\/\/www.jamestown.org\/publications_details.php?volume_id=400&&issue_id=3179","http:\/\/www.globalsecurity.org\/military\/library\/news\/2005\/12\/mil-051216-mnfi01.htm","http:\/\/jamestown.org\/terrorism\/news\/article.php?issue_id=3467","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20070930183013\/http:\/\/jamestown.org\/terrorism\/news\/article.php?issue_id=3467","http:\/\/www.cfr.org\/publication.html?id=7685","https:\/\/nationalpost.com\/news\/story.html?id=eb1cec1e-566d-4f9f-afcc-f794145f64b7&p=2","https:\/\/archive.is\/20130928230142\/http:\/\/www.nationalpost.com\/news\/story.html?id=eb1cec1e-566d-4f9f-afcc-f794145f64b7&p=2","https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0479980\/"]}
{"title":"Maxim restaurant suicide bombing","article":"The Maxim restaurant suicide bombing was a suicide bombing which occurred on October 4, 2003 in the beachfront \"Maxim\" restaurant in Haifa, Israel. Twenty-one people were killed in the attack and 51 were injured. Among the victims were two families and four children, including a two-month-old baby.\n\nThe restaurant, which is located at the seafront near the southern boundary of the city of Haifa, was frequently attended by both Arab and Jewish local populations, and was widely seen as a symbol of peaceful coexistence in Haifa.\n\nMilitant organization Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack. It was condemned by Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.\nThe restaurant's interior was destroyed by the blast (it was completely rebuilt seven months after the attack).\n\n== Background ==\nThe Maxim restaurant is a beachfront restaurant located near the south entry to Haifa. It is co-owned by Jews and Christian Arabs, and is known for being a symbol of co-existence.\n\n== The attack ==\n\nOn October 4, 2003, the 28-year-old Palestinian suicide bomber Hanadi Jaradat detonated the explosive belt she was wearing inside the Arab-Jewish Maxim restaurant in Haifa. 21 Israelis (18 Jews and 3 Arabs) were killed, and 51 others were wounded.\nThe bomb included metal fragments packed around the explosive core, that sprayed around the restaurant, maximizing lethal effect. According to Haifa police sources, the aftermath was gruesome, with some of the dead still sitting upright at their tables, while others, including children and babies, were slammed against the walls. Due to the force of the explosion, all that remained of Jaradat was her head.\n\nAmong the victims were two families and four children, including a two-month-old baby. Three Maccabi Haifa officials were lightly injured in the bombing.\n\n=== Fatalities ===\n\n\nSource: \n\n== The perpetrator ==\n\nThe suicide bomber, 28-year-old Hanadi Jaradat from Jenin, was the sixth female suicide bomber of the Al-Aqsa Intifada and the second woman recruited by Islamic Jihad.\n\nWhen she was 21, her fianc\u00e9 had been killed by Israeli security forces. At the time of her suicide bombing, Jaradat was a law student due to qualify as a lawyer in a few weeks. According to a story in Ha'aretz, based on Arab media and interviews with Israeli and Arab sources, she agreed to the bombing after Israel Defense Forces undercover operatives in Jenin killed her cousin (Salah, 34), and her younger brother (Fadi, 25), both of whom were accused by Israeli forces of being Islamic Jihad operatives, with her cousin being considered to be a senior member of the Al-Quds Brigades group.\n\n== Israeli response ==\n\nThe day following the suicide bombing, the Israeli Army demolished the home of Jaradat's family, and the homes of two neighbors who were uninvolved in the bombing. In response to the attack, which Israel claimed was planned in the Damascus headquarters of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an alleged terrorist training camp in Ain es-Saheb, Syria, was bombed by four Israeli Air Force jets. One person was injured, and munitions were allegedly destroyed during the strike.\n\nJamal Mahadjne, an Israeli-Arab from Umm al-Fahm, was arrested within hours of the attack for driving Jaradat to her destination. Mahadjne had regularly taken fees for illegally driving Palestinians to Israel, taking advantage of his Israeli identity card to cross the border without difficulty. He confessed his actions to Shin Bet agents, and was indicted before the Haifa District Court for being an accessory to murder and for other crimes relating to his illegal activities on November 10.\n\nOn November 7, Israel Defense Forces troops arrested senior Islamic Jihad militant Amjad Abeidi, who planned the attack, along with a number of other suicide bombings, during an operation in Jenin. During the operation, Jenin was placed under curfew as soldiers searched homes. One Palestinian teenager was shot dead while climbing a tank, and three Palestinians were wounded. The complex in which Abeidi was hiding was located and searched, and a weapons cache was found. After a grenade was thrown into the cache, Abeidi was lightly wounded and surrendered. As the soldiers left Jenin with Abeidi, Palestinian militants opened fire at them, and the soldiers returned fire. One militant, a member of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, was killed. Abeidi was handed over to Shin Bet for interrogation.\n\nIn 2017 Oran Almog, one of the victims of the attack, addressed the United Nations Security Council to demand that the Palestinian Authority cease incentivizing terrorism by paying stipends to terrorists.\n\n==Official reactions==\nIsraeli prime minister Ariel Sharon stated that Israel held Palestinian President Yasser Arafat responsible for the attack. Arafat condemned the bombing. U.S. President George W. Bush condemned the attack, calling it a \"murderous action\"and a \"despicable attack\".\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nIn response to his daughter's actions, her father Taisir declined all condolences, instead saying that he was proud of what his daughter had done, and that \"I will accept only congratulations for what she did.

{"title":"Shmuel HaNavi bus bombing","article":"The Shmuel HaNavi bus bombing was the suicide bombing of a crowded public bus (Egged bus 2) in the Shmuel HaNavi quarter in Jerusalem, Israel, on August 19, 2003. Twenty-four people were killed and over 130 wounded. Many of the victims were children, some of them infants. The Islamist militant group Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\n==The attack==\nOn August 19, 2003 (22 Av 5763), a Hamas suicide bomber sent out by the organization's Hebron cell disguised himself as a Haredi Jew and detonated himself on a No. 2 Egged bus traveling through Jerusalem's Shmuel HaNavi neighborhood. He blew himself up after entering the back door. The double-length bus was crowded with Orthodox Jewish children returning from a visit to the Western Wall. The huge explosion killed 7 children and 16 adults, among them an eight-months-pregnant woman, and injured more than 130 people. The bomb was spiked with ball-bearings designed to increase injuries on the crowded bus. Hamas said the bomber was a 29-year-old mosque preacher from the city of Hebron.\n\nBecause so many of the dead and injured were children, the media dubbed it the \"children's bus\". According to an Associated Press report,\n\n\n===Fatalities===\n\n\n==The perpetrators==\nBoth Hamas and Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack. According to Tariq Ali, however, the bombing was carried out by a \"self-proclaimed 'Hamas' cell from Hebron, disowned and denounced by the official leadership.\" The attack put an end to the so-called Hudna that had been announced in July 2003. United States president George W. Bush sent his condolences to the victims' families. The European Commission also denounced what it called the \"devastating terrorist attack\" and called on the Palestinian Authority to intervene to bring a halt to such acts:\n\nThe European Commission strongly condemns last night's devastating terrorist attack in Jerusalem and expresses its sincere condolences to the families of the victims and to the Israeli Government. This is an attack on all the forces working for peace. The European Commission calls on the Palestinian Authority to do everything in its powers to prevent such unacceptable and unjustified act of violence, and urges the PA and the Israeli Government to pursue their dialogue and common efforts towards peace as set out in the Road Map.\n\n==Aftermath==\nFollowing the attack, Israeli forces arrested 17 Palestinians suspected of being Hamas activists, including several of the bomber's relatives, while Hamas leader Ismail Abu Shanab and his two bodyguards were killed by an Israeli helicopter missile strike in Gaza.\n\nIn 2004 a memorial plaque to the victims was erected in the Beit Yisrael neighborhood of Jerusalem. The name of the only non-Jewish victim, Maria Antonia Reslas, was engraved separately from the names of the other victims, with the title \"Mrs\" rather than the title \"sainted\" (kadosh) used for the Jews, resulting in some controversy.\n\n==See also==\n*Civilian casualties in the Second Intifada\n*Dizengoff Center suicide bombing\n*Israeli casualties of war\n*Kiryat Menachem bus bombing\n*Patt junction bus bombing\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n*  Bus bombing in Jerusalem kills at least 18, injures more than 100 \u2013 published on NPR on August 19, 2003\n*  18 killed, over 110 hurt in Jerusalem bus bomb \u2013 published on Haaretz on August 20, 2003\n*  Bus bomb carnage in Jerusalem \u2013 published on BBC News on August 20, 2003\n*  Bomber his bus carrying Israeli families 18 die, 100 wounded; children among victims \u2013 published on the Boston Globe on August 20, 2003\n*  Suicide bombing of No. 2 Egged bus in Jerusalem August 19, 2003 \u2013 published at the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs","urls":["http:\/\/www.rememberthesechildren.org\/remember2003.html","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=HkGcAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA193","https:\/\/mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/MFA-Archive\/2003\/Pages\/Suicide%20bombing%20of%20No%202%20Egged%20bus%20in%20Jerusalem%20-%201.aspx","http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/print-edition\/news\/after-praying-for-a-seventh-child-nava-s-baby-died-in-her-arms-1.97835","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2003\/WORLD\/meast\/08\/19\/jerusalem.bomb.scene.ap\/index.html","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2003\/Avraham%20Bar-Or","http:\/\/www.zanhanim.org.il\/Info\/n_show.aspx?id=22962<\/ref>","http:\/\/news.nana10.co.il\/Article\/?ArticleID=76805","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2003\/Feiga%20Dushinski","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2003\/Miriam%20Eisenstein","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2003\/Lilach%20Kardi","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2003\/Menachem%20Leibel","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2003\/Elisheva%20Meshulami","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2003\/Tehilla%20Nathanson","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2003\/Chava%20Rechnitzer","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2003\/Mordechai%20Reinitz","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2003\/Issachar+Reinitz.htm","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2003\/Maria%20Reslas","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2003\/Liba%20Schwartz","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2003\/Hanoch%20Segal","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2003\/Goldie%20Taubenfeld","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2003\/Shmuel+Taubenfeld.htm","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2003\/Eliezer%20Weisfish","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2003\/Shmuel%20Wilner","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2003\/Shmuel%20Zargari","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2003\/Fruma%20Rahel%20Weitz","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2003\/Rabbi+Mordechai+Laufer.htm","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-%20Obstacle%20to%20Peace\/Memorial\/2003\/Tova%20Lev","https:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9A05EFDD1E30F933A1575BC0A9659C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/middle_east\/3165279.stm","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/world\/middle_east\/3170895.stm","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2008\/dec\/30\/gaza-hamas-palestinians-israel1","http:\/\/www.europa-eu-un.org\/articles\/en\/article_2656_en.htm","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/middle_east\/3165997.stm","http:\/\/www.webgaza.net\/gaza_strip\/gaza\/people_profiles\/Abu-Shanab_Ismail.htm","http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/hasen\/objects\/pages\/PrintArticleEn.jhtml?itemNo=465063"]}
{"title":"Haifa bus 37 suicide bombing","article":"The Haifa bus 37 suicide bombing was a suicide bombing carried out on 5 March 2003 on an Egged bus in Haifa, Israel. Seventeen passengers were killed in the attack and 53 were injured. Many of the victims were students from Haifa University.\n\nThe Palestinian Islamist militant organization Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack. The suicide bomber was 20-year-old  Mahmoud Umdan Salim Qawasmeh, a student at the Palestine Polytechnic University. An Israeli Arab resident of Haifa who helped plan the attack was also tried and sentenced to life imprisonment for his involvement.\n\n==The attack==\nThe attack occurred on 5 March 2003,  when a suicide bomber from Hebron detonated a bomb hidden underneath his clothes on a bus carrying many children and teenagers on their way home from school. The bus exploded as it was pulling out of station on Moriyah Street, a main traffic artery near the Carmeliya neighborhood, heading from the Bat Galim neighborhood to the University of Haifa. The explosion occurred while the bus was packed with commuters. The attack killed 17 people and wounded 53. Police said the bomb, strapped to the bomber's body, was laden with metal shrapnel in order to maximize the number of injuries.\n\n=== Fatalities ===\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nSpokesmen from Hamas and Islamic Jihad praised the attack. \"We will not stop our resistance,\" said Abd al-Aziz Rantisi of Hamas. \"We are not going to give up in the face of the daily killing of Palestinians.\" In response, Israeli helicopters killed Hamas leader Ibrahim al-Makadmeh and three of his bodyguards.\n\nOn 18 October 2011, Israel released three people convicted of planning the attack, Maedh Waal Taleb Abu Sharakh (19 life sentences), Majdi Muhammad Ahmed Amr (19 life sentences) and Fadi Muhammad Ibrahim al-Jaaba (18 life sentences), as part of the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange.\n\n==See also==\n*List of Hamas suicide attacks\n\n==References==\n\n\n== External links ==\n* Bus bomb Rocks Haifa - published on The Daily Telegraph on 5 March 2003\n* Deadly bus blast rocks Haifa - published on BBC News on 6 March 2003\n* Explosion rips through bus, killing at least 15 in Israel ; American among victims; lull in suicide attacks ends - published on the Boston Globe on 6 March 2003\n* Memorial site of Liz Katzman \t\n* Memorial site of Tal Khermann","urls":["http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/mfa\/go.asp?MFAH0n5r0","https:\/\/pqasb.pqarchiver.com\/jpost\/access\/301381811.html?dids=301381811:301381811&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT","http:\/\/news.walla.co.il\/?w=\/\/490855","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050503113542\/http:\/\/news.walla.co.il\/?w=%2F%2F490855","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2003\/mar\/07\/israel1","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2003\/mar\/06\/israel","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/MFAArchive\/2000_2009\/2004\/1\/Suicide%20bombing%20of%20Egged%20bus%20No%2037%20in%20Haifa%20-%205-Ma","http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/hamas-vows-to-avenge-leaders-death\/","http:\/\/www.jpost.com\/DiplomacyAndPolitics\/Article.aspx?id=241857","http:\/\/www.shabas.gov.il\/NR\/rdonlyres\/09ED13AD-30EB-4F28-8FEA-7A9EDB0F9119\/0\/listeng1.xls]<\/ref>"]}

{"title":"2003 Istanbul bombings","article":"The 2003 Istanbul bombings were a series of suicide attacks carried out with trucks fitted with bombs detonated at four different locations in Istanbul, Turkey on November 15, 2003 and November 20, 2003.\n\nOn November 15, two truck bombs were detonated, one in front of the Bet Israel Synagogue in \u015ei\u015fli at around 9:30\u00a0a.m. local time (UTC+2.00) and another in front of the Neve Shalom Synagogue in Beyo\u011flu at around 9:34\u00a0a.m. As a result of these bombings, 28 people died, included the attackers, and more than 300 people were wounded. Five days after the first attacks, on November 20, two different attacks were perpetrated against the British Consulate General at around 10:55\u00a0a.m. and the HSBC General Headquarters in Be\u015fikta\u015f at around 11:00\u00a0a.m., again using truck bombs. In the second round of attacks, 31 people lost their lives and more than 450 were injured. In total, 59 people died, including the four suicide bombers, and more than 750 were wounded in the bombings.\n\nInvestigations launched in the wake of the attacks determined that Al Qaeda had orchestrated the bombings. The criminal case that began with 69 defendants and, with additions, included 76 defendants in February 2004 regarding the attacks concluded in April 2007 with the sentencing of 49 defendants, of whom seven were sentenced to life in prison, to various periods of incarceration. Some of the figures allegedly from the upper echelons of the militant organization fled to Iraq after the attacks and died there, while a portion were captured by security forces. After a retrial held because the Court of Cassation reversed some of the verdicts delivered in the initial trial, 16 defendants were not sentenced to prison.\n\n== First bombings and aftermath ==\nThe first attacks were carried out on November 15, 2003 against two synagogues in Istanbul, Turkey. At approximately 9:30\u00a0a.m. local time (UTC+2.00), a bomb-laden truck that had parked in front of the Bet Israel Synagogue on Nakiye Elg\u00fcn Street in \u015ei\u015fli was detonated. Many of the worshippers praying at the synagogue that Saturday, a day considered sacred by Jews, and those near the temple lost their lives, and the area surrounding the synagogue was badly damaged.\n\nApproximately four minutes after the first explosion, at around 9:34\u00a0a.m., a second attack occurred with the detonation of another bomb-laden truck passing by the Neve Shalom Synagogue on B\u00fcy\u00fck Hendek Avenue in Beyo\u011flu. Prayers were being held in three separate rooms of the synagogue, and a child's Bar Mitzvah ceremony was being held with 400 people in attendance. Because the walls of the synagogue had been fortified after previous attacks, the internal walls of the structure were not badly damaged, but the external wall and surrounding shops and buildings were damaged, and passers-by were killed by the blast. A hole approximately three meters wide and two meters deep appeared at the spot where the bomb exploded.\n\nTeams from the Istanbul Metropolitan Fire Department, Health Department, Directorate of Road Maintenance, and Directorate of Cemeteries; the Istanbul Gas Distribution and Trade; and the Istanbul Water and Sewage Administration arrived at the scenes of both attacks. Search-and-rescue teams dug survivors out from beneath the debris resulting from the explosions and sent them to nearby health institutions. A team from ZAKA coming from Israel that comprised seven people who were experts in search-and-rescue and identification participated in the work after the explosions.\n\nAn Islamic militant group, IBDA-C, claimed responsibility for the blasts, but it was later determined that the attacks had been carried out by Al Qaeda.\n\n== Second bombings and aftermath ==\nFive days later, on November 20, as US President George W. Bush was in the United Kingdom meeting with Prime Minister Tony Blair, two more truck bombs exploded. The first attack occurred at around 10:55\u00a0a.m. (UTC+2.00) with the detonation of a bomb, comprising 700 kilograms of ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, and compressed fuel oil, in a truck that had parked in front of the HSBC Bank AS building on B\u00fcy\u00fckdere Avenue in the Levent neighborhood of Be\u015fikta\u015f. There were fatalities and injuries inside and near the building, and after the explosion, the first six aboveground stories of the building became unusable and the front side of the building was badly damaged. Inside the building, an elevator that had been in motion at the time of the bombing collapsed. Body parts were flung from the site of the explosion, some even being found as far as 400 meters away at a petrol station.\n\nApproximately five minutes later, at around 11:00\u00a0a.m., another bomb-laden truck drove through security and detonated in front of the British Consulate on Me\u015frutiyet Avenue in Istanbul's Beyo\u011flu district. Deaths and injuries were immediately reported from the explosion, and the outer wall of the consulate's front garden collapsed onto cars driving by in the street, and a fire burned in the garden itself. Buildings nearby the consulate, including the entrance to the \u00c7i\u00e7ek Passage market, and cars on the street were also badly damaged.\n\nAfter the attack perpetrated against the HSBC building, police cordoned off the area and began collecting evidence. Electrical and gas lines were shut off, and metro services were stopped. The wounded and other personnel were evacuated from the rear entrance of the building. The fire department, civil defense, provincial health directorate, police, and consulate officials dispatched to the area began search-and-rescue operations. Police also cordoned off the area surrounding the consulate. Within a day, Interior Minister Abd\u00fclkadir Aksu, Istanbul Governor Muammer G\u00fcler, and Istanbul Provincial Security Director Celalettin Cerrah participated in the investigations. Shortly after the two attacks, a warning of an additional bombing at the Galleria Shopping Center in Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y began to spread; the Akmerkez, Galleria, and Carousel shopping centers were evacuated, although the warnings ended up being baseless.\n\nThe bombers appeared to have waited for the traffic lights in front of the HSBC headquarters on the B\u00fcy\u00fckdere Avenue in Levent to turn red to maximize the effects. Police say that the bombers may have timed the attacks to coincide with Bush's visit to the UK.\n\n== Casualties ==\n\n=== First attacks ===\nOn the day the attacks were carried out, the Istanbul Provincial Health Directorate issued a statement at 4:00\u00a0p.m. that 20 people had died and 257 were injured in the bombings. A few hours later, Health Minister Recep Akda\u011f announced that the number of deaths was 20 and that 302 people had referred to various hospitals because of the bomb attacks. Interior Minister Abd\u00fclkadir Aksu, however, stated that the identified number of injured people was 277. Later the evening of the attack, a statement issued by the Istanbul Security Directorate increased the number of casualties to 23, it shortly thereafter brought the number back down to 20. The following day, Istanbul Provincial Health Director Erman Tuncer reported, again, that 23 people had died and that about 71 people, of whom four were in critical condition, continued to received medical attention at various hospitals. The number of casualties rose to 24 on November 17 when the body of a woman was found at the scene of the bombing and later to 25 when a victim receiving treatment at a hospital succumbed to their injuries. In a statement he made on November 19, Istanbul Governor Muammer G\u00fcler announced that 25 people had died and approximately 300 people were injured as a result of the attacks. On November 28, Istanbul Deputy Security Director Halil Y\u0131lmaz reported, in a press release riddled with inaccuracies, that 23 people had died from the first bombings but later corrected the mistakes in a statement to the press and changed the number of casualties to 27. This number rose to 28 on February 9, 2004 when Celal Dilsiz, a patient who had been receiving care in a hospital for almost three months, died from his injuries.\n\nThe funeral ceremonies for six Jews who died in the attacks\u2014Yoel \u00dcl\u00e7er Kohen, Berta \u00d6zdo\u011fan, Yona Romano, Annette Rubinstein, Anna Rubinstein, and Avram Varol\u2014were held at the Ulus Ashkenazi Jewish Cemetery. The six people were laid to rest in the front section of the mausoleum were 23 people killed in the 1986 attack on the Neve Shalom Synagogue were buried.\n\n=== Second attacks ===\nA statement issued by the Office of the Istanbul Governor Public Order Operations Center on the day of the second attacks reported that 27 people had died\u201411 in the attack in front of the HSBC General Directorate and 16 at the British Consulate\u2014and more than 450 people were injured in the bombings. According to a written statement on November 24 from the Istanbul Provincial Health Directorate, 432 people had been treated and discharged from the hospital and 30 people, of whom six were in intensive care, were still receiving treatment. On November 28, Istanbul Deputy Security Director Halil Y\u0131lmaz reported that 28 people had died in the second attacks, shortly thereafter later raising this figure to 30. Two months later, on January 13, 2004, the number of casualties in the second two attacks rose to 31, when Sefer G\u00fcndo\u011fdu, a 35-year-old father of three, passed away at around 5:00\u00a0p.m. at \u015ei\u015fli Etfal Hospital after undergoing a series of surgeries.\n\nFamous Turkish actor and singer Kerem Y\u0131lmazer died in the HSBC bombing as he walked to the NTV building, where worked as a voice actor on the \"Life Style\" program at the TV channel. Y\u0131lmazer's wife G\u00f6ksel Kortay, the famous Turkish actress, was on a live program on TV8 when the news of the bombings broke. The 58-year-old British consul general and career diplomat Roger Short also perished in the attack.\n\n== Damage ==\nIstanbul Governor Muammer G\u00fcler, in a statement on November 19, announced that inspections of 58 buildings in Beyo\u011flu after the synagogue attacks revealed nine buildings that were severely damaged, three that were moderately damaged, and eight that were somewhat damaged, amounting to damages of 37 billion Turkish Liras (equivalent to approximately US$25 million in November 2003). In \u015ei\u015fli, of the 52 buildings examined, none were severely damaged, seven were moderately damaged, and 12 were somewhat damaged, with damages totaling 33 billion Turkish Liras (about US$22.5 million in November 2003). There was a total of 110 billion Turkish Liras (approximately US$75 million in November 2003) in damages and 33 cars\u201415 in Beyo\u011flu and 18 in \u015ei\u015fli\u2014were made unusable due to the first bombings.\n\nA total of 113 buildings were damaged in the second round of attacks. Beylo\u011flu Municipal Mayor Kadir Topba\u015f announced that 38 buildings, of which 25 were considered historic, were damaged in Beylo\u011flu. Be\u015fikta\u015f Municipal Mayor Yusuf Namo\u011flu reported that 75 buildings were damaged in Levent, including a historic school building in the nearby Zincirlikuyu quarter.\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n=== After the first attacks ===\n\n*  Germany - German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer condemned the attacks in a written statement. German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der sent a message of condolence to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.\n* United States - US President George W. Bush, on a phone call with President Erdo\u011fan, conveyed his condolences, condemned the bombings \"in the strongest possible terms\", and declared the United States \"stands resolutely with Turkey\". In a statement, President Bush said: \"The focus of these attacks on Turkey's Jewish community, in Istanbul's synagogues where men, women and children gathered to worship God, remind us that our enemy in the war against terror is without conscience or faith.\" US Secretary of State Colin Powell also called Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah G\u00fcl to send his condolences.\n\n== Responsibility ==\n\nInitially, a militant Turkish Islamic group, the Great Eastern Islamic Raiders' Front took responsibility.\n\nTurkey charged 74 people with involvement in the bombings, including Syrians Loai al-Saqa and Hamid Obysi, and a Turk, Harun Ilhan. Ilhan admitted that he and two other suspected ringleaders \u2014 Habib Akda\u015f and Gurcan Bac \u2014 were responsible; Ilhan referred to himself as \u2018an al-Qaeda warrior'. Akdas fled to Iraq, where he was reportedly involved in a kidnapping, and was later killed by coalition forces in Fallujah. Bac's location remains undetermined. Other reporting indicates that Bac was suspected of preparing the bombs with Fevzi Yitiz, and that Akdas and Ibrahim Kus participated in a meeting with bin Laden in 2002.  Al-Saqa had already been tried in absentia in Jordan for his part, along with al-Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, in the failed poison gas attack in 2002. On February 16, 2007, Al-Saqa and Ilhan were convicted and sentenced to 67 consecutive life sentences, one for every victim for the bombing plus additional terms for terrorism and conspiracy, as were five other Turkish men convicted of organising the bombing: Fevzi Yitiz (for helping to build the truck bombs) and Yusuf Polat, Baki Yigit, Osman Eken and Adnan Ersoz.  Seyit Ertul was sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment for leading an al-Qaeda cell, and Obysi was sentenced to 12 years and 6 months for al-Qaeda membership, forgery and bomb-making. Of the other individuals who were charged, 29 were sentenced to 6 years and 3 months for aiding and abetting al-Qaeda, 10 were sentenced to 3 years and 9 months membership in al-Qaeda, and 26 were acquitted.\nA Turkish intelligence official who was part of the investigation said: \"They planned and carried out the attack independently after receiving the blessing of bin Laden.\"\n\nHowever, in 2010, Turkish investigators accused three of the highest-ranking military leaders at the time of the bombing of orchestrating the attacks in the hopes of destabilising the government and prompting a military coup.  Gen \u00c7etin Dogan, head of the 1st Army and then deputy chief of the military staff, Gen Ibrahim F\u0131rt\u0131na, ex-air force chief, and former naval commander Admiral \u00d6zden \u00d6rne, along with 35 other ex-military personnel were arrested and questioned concerning their roles in Operation Sledgehammer, of which the bombings were reportedly a part.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* 1999

{"title":"Beersheba bus bombings","article":"The Beersheba bus bombings were two suicide bombings carried out nearly simultaneously aboard commuter buses in Beersheba, Israel, on August 31, 2004. 16 people were killed and more than 100 were injured. Hamas claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe previous major attack on Be'er sheva was the 19 October 1998 grenade attack on the Central bus station, where 64 people were wounded when a Palestinian from Hebron threw two grenades at the bus station.\n\nDuring the Second Intifada in the early 2000s (decade), at the time which was characterized by an intensified period of suicide attacks were carried out in Israel by the Palestinian militant organizations in Israel, Be'er Sheva was considered a relatively safe place, as it did not experience any terror attacks.\n\nIn 2004, the year in which the attack was carried out, the second intifada was declining, and then the tensions escalated in March 2004, with the assassination of the leader of Hamas Ahmed Yassin. A month later, in April, Yassin's successor Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi was assassinated. After those two assassinations Israel had the quietest four months since the outbreak of the Second Intifada, which came to an end when the Beersheba bus bombings were carried out.\n\n==The attacks==\nAt time of the attacks, the \"Metrodan Beersheba\" public buses (lines 6 and 12) were packed with Israeli civilians and were traveling along the main street of Beersheba, Rager Boulevard, near the Cty hall, at a very crowded place. At 14:50 pm, the first bomber blew up the explosive device hidden underneath his clothes on bus No. 6 as the bus passed a busy intersection in the center of town. Two minutes later, the second bomber blew himself up while on board bus No. 12 which was located about 100 meters away from the first bus. The force of the explosion, which blew away and mutilated the limbs of many civilians, made it difficult for the authorities to identify the victims. The youngest victim was a 3\u00bd year old boy killed while sitting on his mother's lap.\n\n===Fatalities===\n\nMany of the passengers had been returning from shopping at an open-air market, while others were students coming home from school.\nAccording to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the fatalities, all residents of Beersheba, were:\n\n\n\n== The perpetrators ==\nAfter the attacks the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, claimed responsibility for the attacks. Hamas distributed leaflets in Hebron which stated that the attack was in revenge for the assassination of Hamas leaders Ahmed Yassin and Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi by Israel. The Israeli government accused Syria and \"terror command posts in Damascus\" of involvement in the attack.\n\nA video tape released after the attack by Hamas showed the two suicide bombers, Nassem Jabari (22) and Ahmad Qawasme (26), posing with rifles and posters.\n\n==Reactions==\nFollowing the bombing, an estimated 20,000 Hamas supporters in Gaza took to the streets to celebrate.\n\nThe Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom placed the blame on Yasser Arafat for not preventing the attacks, and for bringing nothing but \"terror and evil\" since his return to the Palestinian territories.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe lethal attack was a shock to the Israeli public, especially due to the fact that the two Palestinian suicide bombers managed to get from Hebron to Beersheba after simply walking across the Green Line demarcation lines without difficulty. For this reason, after the attack many Israeli public officials, including Police Commissioner Moshe Karadi made emphasized that a hermetic separation barrier between Israel and the West Bank was vital to Israel's security. The southern part of the Israeli West Bank barrier was completed only after the attack.\n\nOn September 26, 2004, Izz El-Deen Sheikh Khalil, a senior member of Hamas' military wing, was killed in a car bombing in the al-Zahera district of southern Damascus, Syria. The killing was blamed on Israeli agents. Officially, the Israeli government refused to claim responsibility, but unnamed Israeli sources unofficially acknowledged that Israel had assassinated Khalil as a response to the Beersheba bus bombings.\n\n==See also==\n*Beersheva bus station shooting\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n*  Twin Blasts Kill 16 in Israel; Hamas Claims Responsibility \u2013 published on The New York Times on September 1, 2004\n*  16 killed in suicide bombings on buses in Israel \u2013 published on CNN on September 1, 2004\n*  Suicide terrorists blow up buses in southern Israel \u2013 published on USA Today on August 31, 2004\n*  16 die in Be'er Sheva bombings \u2013 published on Haaretz on September 1, 2004\n*  Be'er Sheva bus bombers were part of Hamas cell in Hebron \u2013 published on Haaretz on September 1, 2004\n*  Double bombing of buses in Beersheba \u2013 published on August 31, 2004 on the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe memorial built near the site of the attack in memory of the victims of the attack.","urls":["http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2004\/WORLD\/meast\/08\/31\/mideast\/","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2004\/09\/01\/world\/middleeast\/twin-blasts-kill-16-in-israel-hamas-claims-responsibility.html","http:\/\/www.globes.co.il\/news\/article.aspx?did=69085<\/ref>","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2004\/Shoshana+Amos.htm","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2004\/Aviel+Atash.htm","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2004\/Vitaly+Brodsky.htm","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2004\/Tamara+Dibrashvilli.htm","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2004\/Raisa+Forer.htm","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2004\/Larisa+Gomanenko.htm","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2004\/Denise+Hadad.htm","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2004\/Tatiana+Korchenko.htm","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2004\/Rosa+Lehman.htm","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2004\/Karine+Malka.htm","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2004\/Nargiza+Ostrovsky.htm","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2004\/Margarita+Sokolov.htm","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2004\/Roman+Sokolovsky.htm","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2004\/Tiroyaient+Takala.htm","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2004\/Eliyahu+Uzan.htm","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Memorial\/2004\/Emmanuel+Yosefov.htm","http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/news\/palestinians-celebrate-deadly-israeli-bus-bombings-1.133300","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/MFAArchive\/2000_2009\/2004\/8\/Double+bombing+in+Beersheba+31-Aug-2004.htm","http:\/\/www.chinadaily.com.cn\/english\/doc\/2004-09\/01\/content_370646.htm"]}

{"title":"Eilat bakery bombing","article":"The Eilat bakery bombing occurred on 29 January 2007 when a Palestinian suicide bomber from the Gaza Strip infiltrated the northern suburbs of Eilat, Israel. Upon seeing the police approaching, he entered a neighbourhood bakery and detonated his bomb, killing three people: the bakery's co-owners and an employee. \n\nIn the midst of Palestinian factional violence, both the Islamic Jihad and the Fatah-affiliated al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades claimed joint responsibility. A third Palestinian group called the Islamic Brigade which was not known also claimed responsibility for the attack along with the other two mentioned above.\n\n==Background==\nThe suicide bomber was 21-year-old Muhammad Faisal al-Saqsaq of Beit Lahia, Gaza Strip. He had previously fought against Israeli troops in Jabalia and Beit Hanoun.\n\nAccording to the Islamic Jihad, Saqsaq initially set out from the West Bank, and later on was smuggled into Jordan. From there he reached Eilat and was given the explosives by militants waiting for him there, after going through seven months of preparations.\n\nIsraeli Internal Security Minister Avi Dichter stated that the bomber infiltrated Israel from Egypt, echoing conclusions of the other intelligence agencies. Israel stated that the suicide bomber had infiltrated through the 220 kilometer Israeli-Egyptian border which is fenceless and patrolled by minimal IDF and Border Police forces. The suicide bomber possibly entered Egypt through a tunnel across the Philadelphi Corridor, and was then driven to the Egyptian\/Israeli border, which he crossed on foot some 30\u00a0km from Eilat.\n\n==The attack==\nAfter infiltrating Israel on 29 January 2007, Saqsaq made his way to Eilat, and when he was in the Simchon neighborhood, he hitched with an Israeli man who was senior officer in the IDF reserves, Lt. Col. Yossi Waltinsky. Waltinsky stated later on in an interview with Channel 10 that he had suspected the hitchhiker was up to something, mainly due to his suspicious heavy clothing and lack of knowledge of Hebrew, nevertheless, he was not able do anything at that point until the suspicious passenger was out of his car. Waltinsky dropped the passenger off near a gas station, about a kilometer from where the attack took place. He immediately phoned the local police station, explaining his encounter and telling the police he believed the man was a terrorist. The call was made seven minutes before the attack came.\n\nUpon receiving Waltinsky's call, two patrol cars were dispatched to investigate. Meanwhile, Saqsaq, who wore a long black winter coat on a warm sunny day, soon approached a small bakery. The local police later on stated that the suicide bomber was carrying the bomb in a backbag rather than an explosives belt. \n\nSaqsaq apparently only stopped at the bakery for coffee, and planned to proceed to a final destination to detonate the bomb, but when he saw the police approaching, he detonated the bomb in the bakery.\n\nThis was Eilat's first suicide bombing, and the first attack to succeed against Israel since 17 April 2006 (others had been attempted, but thwarted by Israeli security forces). Although it was the first suicide bomb to hit the city which is a quiet Red Sea holiday resort, through the years there have been other acts of terror committed near Eilat.\n\n===Fatalities===\nThe people were killed in the attack: \n\n* Emil Almaliach, 32, of Eilat\n* Michael Ben Sa'adon, 27, of Eilat\n* Israel Zamalloa, 26, of Eilat\n\n==The perpetrators==\nPalestinian Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack, together with two other terrorist groups. The bomber was identified as 21-year-old Muhammad Faisal al-Siksik from northern Gaza. Al-Siksik's family noted that he was missing for three days, but they knew he was going on a suicide bombing mission.\n\n==Aftermath==\nA large crowd gathered outside the bomber's home to praise the attack. \"Mohammed be happy. You will go directly to heaven,\" the crowd chanted, while children held pictures of the bomber. He looked pensive in one image, and held a machine gun in another.\n\n==Government reactions==\n;International\n* : Germany, then-holder of the European Union presidency, condemned the attack \"in the strongest terms.\" An EU presidency statement said Germany \"urges the Palestinian leadership to do everything in its power to put an end to terror and bring to justice those who support terror.\"\n* : King Abdullah condemned the bombing, saying in a statement that \"such attacks will only increase the sufferings of the Palestinians.\"\n* : Minister for Foreign Affairs Carl Bildt said, \"I condemn today's terrorist attack in Eilat, Israel. Violence that targets civilians is totally unacceptable. [...] The infighting among Palestinian groups is claiming more and more victims. Palestinian leaders must therefore take their responsibility and quickly find a way to resolve the crisis using peaceful means.\"\n* : Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said, \"We utterly condemn this morning's suicide attack in Eilat. There can be no justification for such attacks.\"\n* : White House spokesman Tony Snow said the responsibility of the bombing lies with the Palestinian Authority government. He added, \"Failure to act against terror will inevitably affect relations between that government and the international community and undermine the aspirations of the Palestinian people for a state of their own.\"\n\n==See also==\n*Heth route\n*List of Palestinian Islamic Jihad suicide attacks\n*Palestinian political violence\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/world\/article\/0,8599,1583096,00.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2007\/01\/29\/world\/middleeast\/29cnd-mideast.html?hp&ex=1170133200&en=672e889f68796e72&ei=5094&partner=homepage","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-dyn\/content\/article\/2007\/01\/29\/AR2007012900939.html","http:\/\/www.israeltoday.co.il\/NewsItem\/tabid\/178\/nid\/11347\/mid\/436\/dnnprintmode\/true\/Default.aspx?SkinSrc=%5BG%5DSkins%2F_default%2FNo+Skin&ContainerSrc=%5BG%5DContainers%2F_default%2FNo+Container","https:\/\/www.upi.com\/Suicide-bomber-kills-three-in-Israel\/21531170103436\/","http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/news\/eilat-driver-warned-police-about-terrorist-minutes-before-attack-1.185514","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/6309029.stm","http:\/\/www.jpost.com\/Israel\/Article.aspx?id=49624","http:\/\/news.sky.com\/story\/485093\/bomber-strikes-israel-holiday-resort","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20121018083206\/http:\/\/news.sky.com\/story\/485093\/bomber-strikes-israel-holiday-resort","http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/hasen\/spages\/819130.html","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Palestinian+terror+since+2000\/Suicide+bombing+in+Eilat+bakery+29-Jan-2007.htm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20121002221114\/http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace\/Palestinian+terror+since+2000\/Suicide+bombing+in+Eilat+bakery+29-Jan-2007.htm","http:\/\/old.btselem.org\/statistics\/english\/Casualties_Data.asp?Category=6&region=ISRAEL&sD=29&sM=09&sY=2000&eD=26&eM=12&eY=2008&filterby=event&oferet_stat=before","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20120402094108\/http:\/\/old.btselem.org\/statistics\/english\/Casualties_Data.asp?Category=6&region=ISRAEL&sD=29&sM=09&sY=2000&eD=26&eM=12&eY=2008&filterby=event&oferet_stat=before","https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/s\/ap\/israel_explosion","http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/hasen\/pages\/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=819038","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2007\/01\/30\/world\/middleeast\/30mideast.html","http:\/\/www.nysun.com\/foreign\/suicide-bomber-kills-three-in-southern-israeli\/47598\/","http:\/\/www.eu2007.de\/en\/The_Council_Presidency\/index.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20070104090035\/http:\/\/www.eu2007.de\/en\/The_Council_Presidency\/index.html","http:\/\/www.eu2007.de\/en\/News\/CFSP_Statements\/January\/0129Eilat.html","https:\/\/archive.is\/20120903171226\/http:\/\/www.eu2007.de\/en\/News\/CFSP_Statements\/January\/0129Eilat.html","http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/hasen\/spages\/819148.html","http:\/\/www.sweden.gov.se\/sb\/d\/8558\/a\/75954","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20070326193228\/http:\/\/www.sweden.gov.se\/sb\/d\/8558\/a\/75954","http:\/\/english.people.com.cn\/200701\/30\/eng20070130_345893.html","http:\/\/www.britishembassy.gov.uk\/servlet\/Front?pagename=OpenMarket\/Xcelerate\/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1036414846587&a=KArticle&aid=1170062378175","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20070929090815\/http:\/\/www.britishembassy.gov.uk\/servlet\/Front?pagename=OpenMarket%2FXcelerate%2FShowPage&c=Page&cid=1036414846587&a=KArticle&aid=1170062378175","http:\/\/today.reuters.com\/news\/articlenews.aspx?type=politicsNews&storyID=2007-01-29T133456Z_01_N29230620_RTRUKOC_0_US-ISRAEL-EXPLOSION-USA.xml&WTmodLoc=NewsHome-C3-politicsNews-2","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20070219221023\/http:\/\/today.reuters.com\/news\/articlenews.aspx?type=politicsNews"]}

Two explosions occurred in front of the rallying truck from which she greeted her supporters and party members at approximately 00:52 PST, on the route about halfway from the airport to the tomb of Muhammad Ali Jinnah for a scheduled rally, just after Bhutto's truck had crossed a bridge. Police vehicles bore the brunt of the blasts, which completely destroyed three police vans and killed at least 20 policemen in the vehicles. Conflicting reports indicate that Bhutto, who was not injured in the attack, was either sitting on top of the truck or had just climbed into the compartment of the truck at the time of the explosion.\n\nBhutto was escorted to her residence, Bilawal House. The victims were rushed to Jinnah Hospital, Liaquat National Hospital, Civil Hospital and Abbasi Shaheed Hospital. In a press conference on 19 October 2007, Bhutto said that her security team were unable to prevent the attack because of the streetlights being turned off, and called for an inquiry into why this happened.\n\nOn 20 October, authorities released a photograph of the suspect responsible for the suicide attack. On 23 October, Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz rejected Pakistan Peoples Party's demand for a probe into the suicide blast by foreign experts, expressing confidence that Pakistani law-enforcement agencies can probe in a very objective manner.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the attempt on her life, Bhutto wrote a letter to General Pervez Musharraf naming four persons whom she suspected of engineering the attacks. Careful not to name Musharraf himself, she chose to name senior military officials and politicians in Musharraf's regime instead, including Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, a rival PML-Q politician and the then chief minister of the province of Punjab, Hamid Gul, former director of the Inter-Services Intelligence agency, and Ijaz Shah, director general of the Intelligence Bureau, another premier military intelligence agency on Pakistan. Musharraf's regime blamed terrorist organisations such as Al-Qaeda and elements of the Taliban in Pakistan instead.\n\nAl-Qaeda's chief of operations for Pakistan, Fahid Mohammed Ally Msalam, was believed to be behind the attack. He was killed in a drone strike in Pakistan along with his lieutenant, Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan, on 1 January 2009.\n\nTehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan leader Baitullah Mehsud was also implicated in the attack. He was killed in a drone strike in Pakistan in August 2009.\n\n==Reaction==\n\n===Pakistan===\n* President Pervez Musharraf called the attacks a \"conspiracy against democracy\".\n* Benazir Bhutto: \"It is dignitaries of the former regime of General Zia who are today behind the extremism and the fanaticism.\"\n* Asif Ali Zardari, Benazir Bhutto's husband: \"I blame the government for these blasts. It is the work of the intelligence agencies.\"\n*Fatima Bhutto, Benazir Bhutto's niece: \"She insisted on this grand show, she bears a responsibility for these deaths and for these injuries.\"\n\n===Other countries===\n* : Prime Minister John Howard said \"It's too early to be certain but it looks very much like the work of al-Qaeda. Benazir Bhutto, to her credit, as well as General Musharraf, have both said they will continue to support the Americans in the War on Terrorism,\" he said. \"It is a reminder of the evil of al-Qaeda. It is a reminder of how important it is not to concede a victory to them in Iraq or in Afghanistan.\n* : Maxime Bernier, minister of foreign affairs, said the bombings were \"an appalling act of violence\", and urged \"all parties in Pakistan to adhere to the rule of law and to continue to build the conditions for free and fair parliamentary elections\"\n* : President Nicolas Sarkozy \"condemned the attack which targeted Benazir Bhutto and which left numerous victims. He sent France's condolences and his sympathy to the president and to the political authorities in Pakistan as well as to the families of the victims.\"\n* : Manmohan Singh, the Prime Minister of India strongly condemned the assassination attempt on Bhutto and conveyed his condolences on the involved loss of life. While Singh's separate letters to Bhutto and Pervez Musharraf condemned \"terrorism and extremism in all its forms\", the leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha, Lal Kishan Advani, rang up Bhutto to personally express his solidarity with her. India's foreign ministry spokesman expressed outrage and anger felt in the country.\n* :\n**Prime Minister Gordon Brown, said \"I was deeply shocked to learn of the bomb blasts in Karachi that have killed over a hundred people and injured so many others. I am appalled by this horrific use of violence against entirely innocent people...On behalf of the British Government please accept my sincerest condolences for those Pakistanis who have lost their lives. You can be assured of the United Kingdom's continuing support to work with all those committed to building a peaceful and democratic Pakistan\"\n**Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs David Miliband, said \"I condemn utterly the use of violence against entirely innocent people and the attempt to suppress the right of Pakistanis to express their democratic voice. I share the shock of the Pakistani community in the United Kingdom at these horrific attacks\".\n* :\n** U.S. Department of State spokesperson Tom Casey: \"There is no political cause that can justify the murder of innocent people. Those responsible seek only to foster fear and limit freedom. The United States stands with the people of Pakistan to eliminate terrorist threats, and to build a more open, democratic, and peaceful society.\"\n**U.S. National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe stated that \"The United States condemns the violent attack in Pakistan and mourns the loss of innocent life there. Extremists will not be allowed to stop Pakistanis from selecting their representatives through an open and democratic process.\"\n\n===International organisations===\n*  Commonwealth of Nations: Secretary-General Don McKinnon condemned the attack, stating \"The legitimate aspirations of the people of Pakistan to enjoy peace, stability, prosperity and a democratic way of life must not be allowed to be thwarted by senseless acts of violence\".\n*  United Nations: A statement issued by a spokesperson for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon read, \"(Ban Ki-moon) strongly condemns this terrorist attack and expresses condolences to the families of the victims. He trusts that all political forces will act together to strengthen national unity.\"\n\n== See also ==\n*Terrorism in Pakistan\n*2007 Pakistani presidential election\n*2008 Pakistani general election\n*Assassination of Benazir Bhutto\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n* Video footage of aftermath\n*  First person account from Bhutto's Bus by Christina Lamb, correspondent for the British The Sunday Times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22px.","urls":["http:\/\/dunyanews.tv\/en\/Pakistan\/107526-Death-toll-in-Lahore-blast-reaches-4","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2007\/10\/20\/world\/asia\/20Pakistan.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20081109122412\/http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2007\/10\/20\/world\/asia\/20Pakistan.html","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/latestCrisis\/idUSSP260961","http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2007\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/10\/18\/pakistan.explosions\/index.html","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/world\/south_asia\/7051804.stm","http:\/\/english.aljazeera.net\/NR\/exeres\/558576E8-6ECB-468C-B70B-75554BBA8B72.htm","http:\/\/afp.google.com\/article\/ALeqM5hdCqqoA64jBFD0E4ryuBm95Au50g","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20071020100650\/http:\/\/afp.google.com\/article\/ALeqM5hdCqqoA64jBFD0E4ryuBm95Au50g","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-dyn\/content\/article\/2009\/01\/08\/AR2009010803110.html<\/ref>","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/south_asia\/7819305.stm","http:\/\/dawn.com\/2012\/08\/07\/i-have-sent-my-men-to-welcome-benazir\/","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/south_asia\/8220762.stm","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/south_asia\/7052310.stm","http:\/\/dawn.com\/2007\/10\/22\/nat3.htm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20071024065926\/http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/2007\/10\/22\/nat3.htm","http:\/\/www.news.com.au\/story\/0,23599,22612935-29277,00.html","https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/world\/136-killed-as-blasts-rip-through-crowds-welcoming-bhutto-1.637509","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/europe\/7051953.stm","http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/2007\/10\/20\/top11.htm","http:\/\/www.number10.gov.uk\/output\/Page13561.asp","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20071025050815\/http:\/\/www.number10.gov.uk\/output\/page13561.asp","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/newsOne\/idUSISL24512920071019?pageNumber=3","http:\/\/www.thecommonwealth.org\/news\/171087\/191007sgonbhutto.htm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20071221071236\/http:\/\/www.thecommonwealth.org\/news\/171087\/191007sgonbhutto.htm","http:\/\/www.maximsnews.com\/107mnunoctober18deadlybombattack.htm"]}

{"title":"2008 Lal Masjid bombing","article":"In the Lal Masjid bombing of 6 July 2008 at 7:50\u00a0pm local time, a 30-year-old suicide bomber blew himself up near the Lal Masjid mosque in Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, killing 18 policemen and 1 civilian. The bombing occurred on the first anniversary of the Siege of Lal Masjid and was likely a revenge attack. The attack occurred even amid tight security in Islamabad, where thousands of Islamic students in Pakistan came to mark the day when Pakistani troops stormed Lal Masjid. Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik, who visited the blast site, said about 12,000 students attended the rally and the attack was directed at police.\n\n==Domestic reaction==\n*Minister for Information and Broadcasting \u2013 Sherry Rehman said the \"government would never tolerate such acts and the perpetrators would be taken to task. Neither our religion nor any welfare state allows such acts.

{"title":"Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing","article":"The Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing occurred on the night of 20 September 2008, when a dump truck filled with explosives was detonated in front of the Marriott Hotel in the Pakistani capital Islamabad, killing at least 54 people, injuring at least 266 and leaving a 60\u00a0ft (20 m) wide, 20\u00a0ft (6 m) deep crater outside the hotel. The majority of the casualties were Pakistanis; at least five foreign nationals were also killed and fifteen others reported injured. The attack occurred only hours after President Asif Ali Zardari made his first speech to the Pakistani parliament.\nThe Marriott was the most prestigious hotel in the capital, and was located near government buildings, diplomatic missions, embassies and high commissions.\n\nDuring the investigation, three suspected terrorists were arrested by the Pakistani police. They were suspected of having facilitated the suicide bomber. However later they were acquitted of all charges as no evidence was ever presented against them. The funder of the group behind the attack was confirmed to be Doctor Suhail Lakkis, a billionaire warlord disguised as an Orthopedics Surgeon (Bone Surgeon) working at the American University Medical Center\n\nA few months after the hotel's bombing the Government of Pakistan had re-constructed it, and the Islamabad Marriott reopened officially on 28 December 2008.\n\n==Attack==\n\nThe hotel blast caused a severe natural gas leak that set the top floor of the five-story, 258-room hotel on fire, police said. The explosion was heard 15 kilometres away. The blaze that followed quickly engulfed the entire structure of the Marriott hotel. About two-thirds of the building caught fire as a result of the explosion after a natural gas pipe was blown open, and the reception area was completely destroyed.\n\nThe owner of the Marriott Hotel, Hashoo Group, owned by Sadruddin Hashwani, said the truck carrying the bomb had been stopped at the front barrier. \"Some shots were fired. One of our guards fired back, and in the meantime the suicide bomber detonated all the explosives. All the guards on the gate died\", said Hashwani.\n\n==Victims==\n\n\nMost of the dead were Pakistani citizens; several foreigners were also killed. Two American military personnel and a Danish intelligence agent were killed, and a U.S. State Department employee was missing and presumed dead. The Czech ambassador to Pakistan, Dr. Ivo \u017d\u010f\u00e1rek, also died in the ensuing fire along with his Vietnamese companion   Although \u017d\u010f\u00e1rek had survived the initial blast, he returned to the hotel to help in the rescue effort but was trapped in the burning building. An Egyptian citizen also died in the attack. In addition, six Germans, four Britons and a Filipina receptionist from the hotel were among the injured.\n\n===Meeting of the Pakistani leadership===\nPakistan's top leaders were to have been in the Islamabad Marriott hotel when it was bombed; instead, having changed their plans at the last minute, they gathered for dinner at the Prime Minister's house, a few hundred yards from the explosion, following President Asif Ali Zardari's maiden address to a joint session of parliament. \"The national assembly speaker had arranged a dinner for the entire leadership \u2013 for the president, prime minister and armed services chiefs \u2013 at the Marriott that day\", the Interior ministry head, Rehman Malik, told reporters.\n\nHowever, the hotel owner, Sadruddin Hashwani, denied that such a meeting had ever been scheduled to take place.  According to a spokesman for Hashwani, \"We didn't have any reservation for such a dinner that the government official is talking about.\"\n\nPakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said both Zardari and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani condemned the attack and vowed their determination to deal with terrorism,  with Law Minister Farooq Naek stating \"this is  Pakistan's 9\/11\".\n\n===Explosives used===\nGovernment advisor Rehman Malik said RDX and TNT were used in the attack. Approximately  of RDX was mixed with TNT (Torpex or H6) and a mixture of mortar and ammunition to increase the explosive capacity. Aluminium powder was also mixed with the material to further enhance this capability. Torpex is about 50 percent more powerful than TNT by weight. The blast was heard for many miles throughout the capital.\n\n\"Delay switches\" might also have been used. Guards were first alerted by a minor blast, which was followed by the much larger explosion about four minutes later.\n\n===Video of the attack===\n\n\nThe Pakistani government released the CCTV footage of the attack at a press conference saying that a six-wheeled dumper truck filled with explosives and an accelerant pulled up at the gate and first caught fire before exploding a few minutes later.\n\n===Hashwani claim===\nSadruddin Hashwani, the owner of Islamabad Marriott Hotel, alleged that President Asif Ali Zardari might have been involved in the attack, citing his old rivalry with the President.\n\n==American presence==\nAn unnamed senior security official stated that about 30 U.S. Marines, scheduled to go to Afghanistan, were staying at the hotel, and they were believed to have been the targets of the bombing. This conflicted with information given by another unnamed official, who stated that the Marines were in Pakistan in connection with the visit by U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, who met the Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani and other government officials on Wednesday The personnel were staying on the fourth floor of the hotel, which was also among the most severely damaged by the fire which ensued following the bomb blast. According to the Dawn, a number of the marines who stayed at the hotel sustained injuries; the newspaper also cited an unnamed law enforcement official stating \"personnel of a U.S. security agency\" were in all likelihood a target of the attack. There are also reports that more Americans were present at the hotel, as several senior CIA officers were visiting Islamabad at the time of the attack and were believed to be staying at the hotel, according to unnamed \"well placed sources\". A 29 May 2009 press release from NSA reads: CTM3 Matthew J. O'Bryant, USN, a Navy Cryptologist, was assigned to Navy Information Operations Command (NIOC) Maryland. CTM3 O'Bryant made the ultimate sacrifice on 20 September 2008 while performing a cryptologic mission in Pakistan. The hotel has a direct line of sight to the telecom system in Islamabad Pakistan. \n\nThe other American soldier killed was Major Rodolfo Ivan Rodriguez, USAF. Major Rodriguez was doing work for the US Embassy and staying at the Marriott at the time of the attack.\n\n===Claims of American soldiers breaching security===\nAn MP for the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party, Syed Mumtaz Alam Gillani, has come forward with testimony evidencing a purportedly serious security breach at the Marriott on the night between 16 and 17 September, several days before the bombing. Alam Gillani and two friends are said to have witnessed several large steel boxes being unloaded from a U.S. Embassy truck by a group of U.S. Marines and, according to someone at the hotel, transported to the fourth and fifth floors. Among the several people who witnessed this incident was Pakistan Peoples Party leader Sajjad Chaudhry. However, Alam Gilani was the only one who objected to and protested the apparent security breach taking place, but was met with silence from the American Marines. The hotel security staff did not respond to Alam Gilani's protests as they passively watched what was taking place, not being allowed to go near the boxes by the U.S. Marines. Alam Gilani has since denounced the newspaper account, asserting that he was merely making light conversation with the journalist; the newspaper, however, stands by its account. Pakistani authorities are also investigating this issue.\n\nThe American Embassy has said that it routinely rents rooms at the Marriott. Confronted with the activities of the U.S. Marines on the night of 16\/17 September, embassy spokesperson Lou Fintor stated: \"A team of support personnel often and routinely precede and\/or accompany certain U.S. government officials. They often carry communication and office equipment required to support large delegations, such as high-level administration officials and members of the U.S. Congress.\" However, the incident occurred after Admiral Mullen's departure.\n\n==Consequences==\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari was considering delaying his visit to the US to attend the UN General Assembly session in the wake of the bombing. MP Ayaz Amir said that he felt that the president should cancel his visit given the circumstances, and instead should combat terrorism and extremism. He added, \"I believe that the UN General Assembly annual session is the most useless event in the world where leaders go to listen their own speeches.\" However, Zardari did make it to New York for the opening of the new session of the General Assembly.\n\nDue to the attack, British Airways suspended flights to Islamabad as a precautionary measure \"until further notice.\" British Airways did not resume flights until 2 June 2019\u2014over a decade later. American schools and universities in Islamabad closed for the rest of that week as well.\n\n===Terror pledge===\nThe BBC reported that Pakistan was an important ally of the United States in its \"war on terror\", but that it had disagreements over tactics and had complained about US raids from Afghanistan. Following an apparent power vacuum as a result of the stepping down of former president Pervez Musharraf earlier in the month, U.S. missile-strikes had increased, culminating in the Baghar Cheena airstrike on 17 September.\nAfter the event, president Asif Ali Zardari appealed for \"all democratic forces\" to help to save Pakistan and he pledged to rid Pakistan of Islamic militants: \"Terrorism is a cancer in Pakistan, we are determined, God willing, we will rid the country of this cancer. I promise you that such actions by these cowards will not lower our resolve.\" Pakistan's chief adviser on internal security, Rehman Malik, said \"the authorities would fight on until the last terrorist is cleared. We think that the safe Pakistan, safe Afghanistan is safety for the world and therefore we will not let them have easy way.\"\n\n===Possible perpetrators===\nA Taliban spokesperson denied the group's involvement in the blast, saying they \"do not believe in killing so many locals.\"\n\nAn American intelligence official stated that the attack \"bears all the hallmarks of a terrorist operation carried out by Al Qaeda or its associates.\"\n\nSome investigators suspect another Islamist group, Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami, was responsible for the attack, based upon the similarities between this incident and four previous attacks allegedly conducted by its operatives.\n\nDubai-based Arabiya Television says a group calling itself Fedayeen Islam (also spelled Fedayan-i-Islam), variously translated as \"Islamic Commandos\" or \"Islamic Patriots\" has called Arabiya's correspondent in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. The correspondent said he received a text message on his mobile phone, showing a telephone number. He said he called the number and then heard a recording in which the group admitted launching Saturday's attack. The Arabiya television correspondent says the speaker spoke in English language with a South Asian accent. The Fedayeen Islam group has issued several demands including for Pakistan to stop its cooperation with the United States.\n\n===U.S. airstrike===\n\nOn 1 January 2009 a missile fired from an unmanned aerial vehicle killed al-Qaeda's chief of operations for Pakistan, Fahid Mohammed Ally Msalam, and his aide, Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan. U.S. officials stated that they believed that al-Kini masterminded the hotel bombing.\n\n===Legal Issues===\nRepresented by Miami-based attorney Andrew C. Hall and a Maryland attorney, Jonathan A. Azrael, the family of an American killed in the blast sued Marriott for negligence in federal court in Maryland in 2011.\n\n==Fund==\nThe \"Islamabad Marriott Assistance Fund\" was started by the owner of the hotel as the blast and resulting fires killed about 40 hotel staff, including the security guards who had tried to avert the disaster, while scores of other employees were also wounded.\n\nSadruddin Hashwani said: \"We have set up a fund to cater for the future expenses of the families of employees either killed or wounded in the attack.\" He announced that he would make an initial donation of US$126,000 to the fund, and appealed for people to donate generously.\n\nThe Marriott International and The J. Willard and Alice S. Marriott Foundation also made contributions to the fund, established through United Way to provide financial assistance to the associates and their families affected by the tragedy.\n\n==Investigation==\nA panel that the government had formed, consisting of police officials and experts from security agencies to probe the attack, presented a preliminary report to the Prime Minister. The Interior Secretary Syed Kamal Shah also admitted to the Senate's Standing Committee on his ministry that the blast was the result of a defective security system. He added that the Islamabad police chief has said intelligence agencies had informed the police about an explosives-laden vehicle entering the city to carry out an attack.\n\nThree suspected terrorists Mohammed Aqeel (possibly Dr. Usman), Rana Ilyas and Hameed Afzal were arrested in Peshawar on 17 October by the Pakistani police with connection to the attack were remanded to police custody for 7 days on 18 October for questioning by an anti-terrorism court. They were suspected of having facilitated the suicide bomber. In requesting the court for a 10-day remand, the police also said they hoped to arrest more suspects with information from the three. Judge Sakhi Muhammad Kahut, who remanded the trio to police custody, also ordered police to produce them in court again on 24 October.\n\nA man by the name of Dr. Usman, possibly the same individual, was involved in the attack on the Sri Lanka national cricket team and the raid against the Pakistani Army Headquarters.\n\nPolice said that Qari Ishtiaq, who is said to be the commander of Punjabi Tehrik-i-Taliban, was arrested from Bahawalpur on the information provided by the Hijratullah who has been jailed for 10 years due to his role in Lahore police academy attacks. Seven other militants were arrested from different parts of Punjab regions. Four hundred kilograms (880\u00a0lb) of explosives were also seized from Qari Ishtiaq.\n\nOn 5 May 2010, Mohammed Aqeel, Rana Ilyas, Muhammad Hamid Afzal and Tahseen Ullah were acquitted of all charges as no evidence was ever presented against them.\n\n==International reactions==\n\n===Intergovernmental organizations===\n\n\n===State entities===\n\n\n===Other non-state entities===\n\n\n==See

{"title":"2008 Kabul Serena Hotel attack","article":"The 2008 Kabul Serena Hotel attack was an attack on the gym of the Kabul Serena Hotel, in Kabul, Afghanistan on January 14, 2008 for which the Taliban claimed responsibility.\n\nA Norwegian delegation under Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re was staying at the hotel at the time of the attack. The attack claimed six lives, including Norwegian journalist Carsten Thomassen. Six others were also injured.\n\nThe Kabul Serena Hotel is a five star hotel in Kabul, Afghanistan, belonging to Serena Hotels, designed by the Montreal-based Group Arcop Architects and since its reopening in 2005 has been used by international media crews and politicians. The Hotel also houses the Australian embassy in Afghanistan.\n\n==Details==\n===Attack===\n\nAt 6:30 pm local time, three men disguised in police uniforms created a distraction while a fourth man entered the hotel compound to detonate his suicide vest. Taliban spokesman Zadihullah Mujahid claimed that the militants had been armed with AK-47 automatic rifles, hand grenades and explosive jackets. After a car bomb had detonated outside the hotel, the militants began firing around inside the compound. According to a NATO spokesman, one of the compound guards managed to kill one of the militants before they entered the hotel.\n\nTwo of the militants threw hand grenades at the guards outside, then entered the hotel complex itself. As they entered the hotel, one of the militants detonated a suicide vest, while at least one other, who was wearing an Afghan police uniform, began firing an AK-47.\n\n\nThe Norwegian photographer Stian Solum explained that he was one of those shot at by a man wearing an Afghan police uniform as he left the lift. According to Norwegian foreign ministry spokeswoman Anne Lene Dale Sandsten Norwegian officials were in a meeting one level down from the reception when they heard shooting and \"a big blast\".\n\nThe militants were supposedly planning to target the hotel's exercise and spa facility, which is used by many foreigners.\n\nAfter the attack, American and Afghan forces appeared at the scene in order to set up a perimeter around the hotel and search for the remaining assailants. Private Security Contractors employed by the U.S. State Department Worldwide Personal Protective Services of team Hammer 4 QRF were some of the first responders to arrive on scene. After arriving they began a methodical, room to room clearing of the Hotel. They evacuated over 20 foreign nationals in armored Land Cruiser and Suburban vehicles. The Norwegian ISAF force in Kabul evacuated injured and others from the hotel. The Norwegians used two armoured vehicles, a Sisu XA-186 and a patrol car, including a medic and a nurse during the evacuation.\n\n===Fatalities===\n\n\n\nSix people are believed to have been killed and six wounded. Two Norwegians were shot and severely injured in the attack. One of them was the Dagbladet journalist Carsten Thomassen, who was hit by three rounds and later died from his wounds; the other was a male employee from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs . They were transported by Norwegian soldiers to a Czech ISAF field hospital in Kabul, where Thomassen died during surgery due to his injuries.\n\nTwo hotel guards were killed in the attack as well as a Filipino female employee at the hotel and an American citizen, Thor Hesla, who was a long-time political campaigner for David Wu, Bill Bradley and Bill Clinton, among others. Honoring Thor Hesla  Remarks on the floor of the House by David Wu, cited in Capitol Words, January 15, 2008.  Retrieved March 25, 2012. U.S. Aid Worker Mourned, The Washington Times, January 16, 2008.  Retrieved March 25, 2012.\n\nOne of the attackers was killed by security forces and a second died in the explosion. A diplomat from the United Arab Emirates was shot in the abdomen and severely injured.\n\n===The perpetrators===\nA Western medic who arrived at the hotel after the attack commented that of the four attackers, one was shot and killed in the lobby, one had detonated himself in the courtyard, one apparently locked himself on the hotel roof by mistake and then detonated his explosive vest, and the fourth had fled the scene and was captured by security guards.\n\n===Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re===\n Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re resided at Serena Hotel along with a large delegation from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the time of the attack. Everyone attending the meeting located one floor below the lobby were ordered down on the floor by Norwegian Police Security Service guards. They remained lying while the guards were ready to use their weapons, in case the room itself should be attacked.\n\nThe delegation was then moved to safety in a bomb shelter in the basement of the hotel. At the time of the attack, St\u00f8re had just begun his meeting with the leader of the Afghan Human Rights Commission.\n\nThe United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon later stated that the Norwegian delegation led by Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re had been the targets for the attack., while the Taliban released different statements. One source claimed the Norwegian foreign minister was not the target for the attack, although the Norwegian media claims that the Taliban wished to attack the Serena Hotel while St\u00f8re resided there in order to intimidate on an \"international level\".\n\nDue to security reasons, St\u00f8re cancelled the rest of his visit to Afghanistan the day after the attack.\n\n==International reactions==\n===Countries===\n\n* \u2013 The Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg condemned the attack on the Hotel, saying that: \"This is an unacceptable attack against civilians and another strike against the process towards peace and stability in Afghanistan. Now we are focusing on giving the injured the needed medical treatment as fast as possible.\"The Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re commented the death of Dagbladet journalist Carsten Thomassen, saying: \"Carsten was unique among Norwegian journalists. He combined solid journalistic work with integrity and great knowledge. He has followed me on many journeys and he was until the end filled with his actions as a journalist. Those who as with Carsten in Kabul on January 14 is filled with grief and despair. My thoughts goes to his closest relatives and all of his friends and colleagues.\"\n* \u2013 The Danish Foreign Minister Per Stig M\u00f8ller said: \"The Danish government condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attack on the Norwegian Foreign Minister and the other innocent people. It is a cowardly attack which emphasizes that the threat from Taliban is real and unpredictable. But it is as well a signal about the fact that Taliban is now trying to frighten everyone who want to help Afghanistan away. Taliban's goal is to seize power and reinstate their politics of terror against the outside world. They must and shall not succeed. The Danish commitment stand firm. Let me as well express my deepest sympathies for the victims and their families in and outside Norway, who is our close ally.\"\n*' \u2013 The Icelandic Foreign Minister Ingibj\u00f6rg S\u00f3lr\u00fan G\u00edslad\u00f3ttir said: \"The attack on the Norwegian Foreign Minister is a particularly horrible event, and this is a sign that Afghanistan is a dangerous country.\"\n*' \u2013 Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt condemned the attack in Kabul on his blogg, saying: \"I feel a great disgust for these attacks which in the end hits innocent people and complicates the international efforts to help the development for a better Afghanistan.\"\n\n===International organizations===\n*International Press Institute - The International Press Institute strongly condemned the attack and the killing of Dagbladet journalist Carsten Thomassen. IPI Director David Dadge said: \"This attack on innocent civilians is a brutal act of murder. Our deepest sympathies go out to the families and the colleagues of the victims. Thomassen was simply carrying out his job as a reporter, in this case reporting on an embassy meeting.\"\n*NATO \u2013 A NATO spokesman at the NATO Headquarters in Brussels said: \"Our impression is that the attack was not directed against Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re. Taliban can claim whatever they want without standing behind what they say. They have no credibility\".\n* Taliban - The Taliban spokesman Salah Adin al-Ayoupi confirmed that Taliban had carried out the attack on the Hotel. The Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed said that they wished to attack the Serena Hotel while the Norwegian Foreign Minister was residing there. \"We decided that we should attack at the right time in order to show these ministers and foreigners that our hand and our might can reach anywhere.\" However, the Taliban spokesman Salah Adin al-Ayoupi claimed that Taliban had no knowledge of the foreign minister residing at the hotel at the time of the attack. He claimed that everyone connected to NATO was the target for the attack, as Serena Hotel often housed international delegations.\n* \u2013 Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon suggested that the deadly attack by Taliban militants on Hotel Serena was targeted on the Norwegian foreign minister and said it highlighted the need for action against extremist violence. \"I am very much surprised by this terrorist attack against the foreign minister of Norway. I feel fortunate that he (St\u00f8re) was not injured, but that really confirms that we must take necessary measures to address terrorism\".\n\n==Controversy in Norway==\nThe attack and Thomassen's death in particular triggered controversy in Norway when it became known that the Norwegian Foreign Ministry had ignored recommendations from the Norwegian Police Security Service and the Norwegian military intelligence regarding the security arrangements for St\u00f8re's visit. One particularly controversial decision, which may have contributed to the Taliban's choice of target, was to publish St\u00f8re's itinerary, including the name of the hotel where he would be staying, in advance of the trip.  Furthermore, while it is standard operating procedure for the Norwegian ISAF forces to escort any Norwegian delegation in Afghanistan with a protection detail including a medevac APC, the Foreign Ministry had declined such an escort. Subsequent to the attack, sources within the Norwegian armed forces expressed dismay at the Norwegian Foreign Ministry's lack of proper contingency plans for medical evacuation.\n\n==See also==\n*List of terrorist incidents, 2008\n*2008 Danish embassy bombing - Terrorist attack on the Danish embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan\n*2015 Park Palace guesthouse attack - Terrorist attack targeting foreign nationals at Kabul's Park Palace Guest House\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n\n* bbc.co.uk\n* Serena Hotell Kabul (Hotel Web Site)\n* Google Maps: Satellite image of Kabul and Serena Hotel\n* Aftenposten: Photo Gallery: Terrorist Attack in Kabul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nShot of the perpetrator by a surveillance camera in the lobby of the Serena Hotel in Kabul.\nU.S. and Afghan soldiers search through the Hotel Serena in Kabul, Afghanistan, after the attack.\nU.S. military personnel outside the perimeter of Serena Hotel.\nthumb.","urls":["http:\/\/www.ctv.ca\/servlet\/ArticleNews\/story\/CTVNews\/20080114\/hotel_blast_080114\/20080114?hub=CTVNewsAt11","http:\/\/www.news.com.au\/couriermail\/story\/0,23739,23054433-953,00.html","http:\/\/www.vg.no\/nyheter\/innenriks\/artikkel.php?artid=506451","http:\/\/pub.tv2.no\/nettavisen\/verden\/article1537704.ece","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20080115202018\/http:\/\/pub.tv2.no\/nettavisen\/verden\/article1537704.ece","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/south_asia\/7187592.stm","http:\/\/www.nettavisen.no\/verden\/article1537999.ece","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20080115213413\/http:\/\/www.nettavisen.no\/verden\/article1537999.ece","http:\/\/www.aftenposten.no\/nyheter\/uriks\/article2195598.ece","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20080119120111\/http:\/\/www.aftenposten.no\/nyheter\/uriks\/article2195598.ece","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/south_asia\/7187592.stm","http:\/\/www.dagbladet.no\/nyheter\/2008\/01\/14\/523835.html","http:\/\/www.vg.no\/nyheter\/utenriks\/artikkel.php?artid=506423","http:\/\/www.mil.no\/languages\/english\/start\/article.jhtml?articleID=150584","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20080323041555\/http:\/\/www.mil.no\/languages\/english\/start\/article.jhtml?articleID=150584","http:\/\/www.dagbladet.no\/nyheter\/2008\/01\/14\/523814.html","http:\/\/www.nettavisen.no\/innenriks\/article1538155.ece","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20080115181403\/http:\/\/www.nettavisen.no\/innenriks\/article1538155.ece","http:\/\/www.aftenposten.no\/nyheter\/uriks\/--Laget-selvmordsvideo-6504539.html","http:\/\/www.emorywheel.com\/detail.php?n=24960","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/south_asia\/7188196.stm","http:\/\/www.aftenposten.no\/nyheter\/uriks\/article2200048.ece","http:\/\/www.aftenposten.no\/nyheter\/uriks\/article2196161.ece","http:\/\/www.vg.no\/nyheter\/utenriks\/artikkel.php?artid=506436","http:\/\/www.vg.no\/nyheter\/utenriks\/artikkel.php?artid=506494","http:\/\/www.dagbladet.no\/nyheter\/2008\/01\/14\/523830.html","http:\/\/www.um.dk\/da\/servicemenu\/Nyheder\/ForsideNyheder\/UdenrigsministerPerStigMoellerUdtalerEfterAngrebetPaaDenNorskeUdenrigsministerIKabul.htm","http:\/\/eyjan.is\/blog\/2008\/01\/14\/ingibjorg-solrun-skelfileg-ti%c3%b0indi-en-islendingarnir-i-kabul-innan-vakta%c3%b0s-sv%c3%a6%c3%b0is\/","http:\/\/carlbildt.wordpress.com\/2008\/01\/14\/allvarligt-attentat-i-kabul\/","http:\/\/www.freemedia.at\/cms\/ipi\/statements_detail.html?ctxid=CH0055&docid=CMS1200411654407","http:\/\/www.vg.no\/nyheter\/utenriks\/artikkel.php?artid=506494","http:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/stories\/afp_asiapacific\/view\/322616\/1\/.html","http:\/\/www.aftenposten.no\/english\/local\/article2199433.ece","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20080117074537\/http:\/\/www.aftenposten.no\/english\/local\/article2199433.ece","http:\/\/www.dagbladet.no\/nyheter\/2008\/01\/15\/523923.html","http:\/\/www.dagbladet.no\/nyheter\/2008\/01\/16\/523972.html"]}

{"title":"July 2010 Lahore bombings","article":"The July 2010 Lahore bombings occurred on  2010 in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. Two suicide bombers blew themselves up at the Sufi shrine, Data Darbar Complex. At least 50 people were killed and 200 others were hurt in the blasts. It was the biggest attack on a Sufi shrine in Pakistan since 2001.\n\n==Background==\nTasawwuf is a part of Islam and the Sufis are those who practice Tasawuf. During the last few centuries it has come under attack from the Wahhabism which consider it polytheistic (which is a claim heavily refuted and disproven).\n\nThe Data Darbar shrine is the burial place of the Sufi saint Syed Ali Hajwairi. His book 'Kashif-ul-Mahjub' (which literally means 'unveiling of the veiled') is the first treatise in Sufi literature known as 'Malfujat'. Thursdays are the busiest days at the shrine as a large number of devotees come to pay their respects and attain blessings.\n\nThe shrine was mostly frequented by members of the Ahle-Sunnath Wal Jamath sect whom the Taliban consider heretics. The shrine was known for its colourful festivals in which the devotees dance, a practice considered un-Islamic by the Taliban. In March 2009 Taliban militants had bombed the shrine of Sufi poet Rahman Baba and in June 2009 Sarfraz Ahmed Naeemi a moderate cleric belonging to the Ahle-Sunnath Wal Jamath sect was killed in a suicide bombing blamed on Taliban.\n\n==Attack==\nPolice initially said that three suicide bombers attacked the shrine. One attack occurred at gate number 5 to the shrine, one in the courtyard, and one in the basement. The attackers struck in the evening, when the shrine was most busy due to the cooler weather.\n\nDoctors said they expected the death toll to rise; and at Mayo Hospital, where the injured were sent, officials declared a state of emergency. Twenty-five people were in critical condition according to hospital officials. The Lahore Police Commissioner Khusro Pervez also appealed to people not to rush to hospitals.\n\n===Immediate reactions===\nMedia personnel were attacked by enraged people at the site. Police also resorted to aerial firing to disperse people gathered at the shrine so as to clear the area. Scuffles then took place between protesters and police as people demanded that investigations be made on loopholes in the security arrangements.\n\nThe next day about 2,000 people, some armed, staged protests in the city shouting \"Down with Shahbaz Sharif\".\n\nPolice were put high alert in Pakistan as demands grew for a tougher crackdown on armed religious groups in central Punjab. Security was also tightened at Sufi shrines across the country, while many Pakistanis, called for the resignation of Punjab government officials.\n\n==Investigation==\nThe administrators of the shrine said that strict security arrangement had been made, and that all devotees entering the shrine were thoroughly checked.\n\nThe police commissioner said that the body parts of two suicide bombers had been found, including two heads. He said the suicide bombers were very young and that each suicide jacket could have carried up to 10\u201315\u00a0kg. of explosives.\n\nOn 5 July, Pakistani authorities arrested 12 suspects, though the identity of the actual perpetrators remains a mystery. Ammunition and weapons were also recovered in the raids in two areas of Lahore. Five police officers were also suspended for security lapses that led to the attack.\n\n==Responsibility==\nThough there has not been a claim of responsibility, previous bombings in Lahore have been blamed on the Pakistani Taliban because of their disagreement with minority interpretations of Islam, such as Sufism. However, Azam Tariq, a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, denied responsibility for the attacks and called them the handiwork of secret foreign agencies. A spokesperson for the Punjabi Taliban, Muhammad Umar, said that \"We don't follow a policy of attacking shrines. During five years of government in Afghanistan, the Taliban never demolished a single shrine. Strategically it would also be ridiculous if we send anybody for any suicide attack. Why should we do that? If we really want to kill people over there all we need is to simply park an explosive laden car and that's all.\" He further termed the incident as an act of spy agencies and Blackwater, aimed to \"defame the Mujahideen.\"\n\nHowever protests were held in Lahore blaming Taliban militants for the attack.\n\n==Reactions==\n;Domestic reactions\n* Prime minister Yousaf Raza Gillani strongly condemned the blasts and asked the police to investigate the crime and submit a report.  Farahnaz Ispahani, spokeswoman for President Asif Ali Zardari issued a statement saying \"This sickening poison of extremism will be driven out of our nation and we will not be cowed.\"\n*Peter Jacob, the national secretary of Justice and Peace, a Pakistani Christian body, said \"We condemn this attack. It is painful to see that people who witness a moderate Islam, such as the Sufi community, are prey to violence. It is also painful to see how even the population of large cities have become vulnerable and a target of terrorism, without any protection...We think the government should take appropriate measures to stop the violence happening now to all moderate people, be they Muslims, Ahmadis, Sufis. The programme of the Taliban is clear, we want that the government act immediately to combat it.\" However, many people interviewed after the attacks blamed the Pakistan government's support for America and drone attacks to be the root cause of these bombings.\n*The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan issued a statement saying \"The assault demonstrates the potency of militant groups that the government incessantly repeats operate from sanctuaries in the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, equally frustrating have been clerics' stock statement that no Muslim can commit such atrocities. Instead of living in denial, the clerics need to reflect on the reasons for religious extremism in Pakistan and the possible consequences and their own contribution to the promotion of intolerance and the cult of violence.\"\n\n;International organisations\n*  Catherine Ashton, the foreign affairs chief of the European Union, said \"The deadly attack is yet another vivid example of the scale of the terrorist threat and extremism in Pakistan.\"\n*  Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon strongly condemned the attack saying \"the deliberate targeting of a crowded place of worship makes this particularly vicious.\"\n\n;National reactions\n*  India issued a statement saying \"The government strongly condemns the terrorist attacks on Data Darbar in Lahore and expresses sympathies to the families of the bereaved.\"\n*  William Hague, the British Foreign Secretary, said \"Britain stands alongside the people and government of Pakistan against those who commit such appalling atrocities.\"\n*  Hillary Clinton condemned the attacks and promised to support Pakistan in its fight against militancy.  Leonard Leo, chairman of United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, called on the Pakistani government to protect the freedom of all religious groups and repeal the country's blasphemy laws.\n\n==Aftermath==\nPrime Minister Gilani announced that the government and opposition would hold a national conference in order to discuss ways to combat terrorism. The conference was attended by the Chief Ministers of all four Pakistani provinces as well as other officials.  Gilani stated that \"after being hit hard in northwest Pakistan, terrorists are on the run and seeking refuge in the urban areas of the country, where they are attacking soft targets and spreading sectarian hatred.\"\n\nAfter the attacks religious leaders of the Barelvi sect accused the Punjab government of having connections with the Taliban. They met with Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif and demanded the resignation of the Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan who had previously campaigned with a leader of the banned militant group Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan. After the meeting, Haji Fazl-e-Karim, one of the Barelvi leaders, told the media \"Rana Sanaullah's contacts with terrorists are most obvious, and he must resign.\"\n\n==See also==\n\n*Sectarian violence in Pakistan\n*List of terrorist incidents, 2010\n*List of terrorist incidents in Pakistan since 2001\n*Terrorism in Pakistan\n\n==References==\n\n\n\n\n\n==External links==\n* In pictures: Blasts at Lahore shrine (BBC)\n* Video: Bombers target Sufi Muslim shrine (Al Jazeera English)","urls":["http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2010\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/07\/02\/pakistan.explosions\/index.html","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/world\/south_asia\/10483453.stm","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/07\/02\/world\/asia\/02pstan.html","http:\/\/www.france24.com\/en\/20100702-pakistan-sufi-attack-islam-lahore-data-darbar-moderate-muslim-terrorism","http:\/\/english.aljazeera.net\/news\/asia\/2010\/07\/20107118495127825.html","https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB10001424052748704525704575341363708803550","http:\/\/www.economist.com\/node\/16512156","http:\/\/tribune.com.pk\/story\/25061\/three-blasts-at-data-darbar\/","http:\/\/thenews.jang.com.pk\/updates.asp?id=107747","http:\/\/english.aljazeera.net\/news\/asia\/2010\/07\/2010721442570131.html","http:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/Lahore-shrine-attack-12-suspects-arrested\/Article1-567861.aspx<\/ref>","http:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/daily_detail.asp?id=248631","https:\/\/www.google.com\/hostednews\/afp\/article\/ALeqM5iGmicD-XnhIwZoQcTtaM9enYhEdw","http:\/\/www.asianews.it\/news-en\/Lahore-Church-in-support-of-Sufis-targeted-by-terrorism-18831.html","http:\/\/thenews.jang.com.pk\/updates.asp?id=107810","http:\/\/www.businessweek.com\/ap\/financialnews\/D9GN2M606.htm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20121024060521\/http:\/\/www.businessweek.com\/ap\/financialnews\/D9GN2M606.htm","http:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/India-condemns-Lahore-terror-attack\/Article1-566562.aspx","https:\/\/archive.is\/20130125083436\/http:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/India-condemns-Lahore-terror-attack\/Article1-566562.aspx","https:\/\/www.google.com\/hostednews\/afp\/article\/ALeqM5iF4eIga-p_2HIEIQF0nc8ri-Wjxw","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/07\/05\/world\/asia\/05pstan.html","http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/wps\/wcm\/connect\/dawn-content-library\/dawn\/news\/pakistan\/04-gilani-meeting-anti-terror-qs-10","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100707001350\/http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/wps\/wcm\/connect\/dawn-content-library\/dawn\/news\/pakistan\/04-gilani-meeting-anti-terror-qs-10","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/world\/south_asia\/10511046.stm"]}

{"title":"2010 Lakki Marwat suicide bombing","article":"The 2010 Lakki Marwat suicide bombing occurred on 1 January 2010, in the village of Shah Hassan Khel, Lakki Marwat District, in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.  At least 105 people died and over 100 were injured, many of them critically, when the suicide bomber blew up his sport utility vehicle filled with explosives in the middle of a crowd that had gathered to watch a volleyball game.\n\n==Attack==\n\nIt was thought that the villagers were targeted because they had formed a pro government militia against the Taliban. In weeks before, militants threatened death to anyone who joined the militia. The bomber drove his Mitsubishi Pajero pickup truck into the middle of the playground, at a busy neighborhood, while a game between local male teams was in progress and detonated it. There were up to 400 people present. The bodies of players were thrown through the air by the blast. It was estimated that more than  of explosives were used. Nearly 300 people had been watching the game when the blast happened. Among the dead were six children and five paramilitary soldiers. The remaining fatalities were mostly spectating teenagers. Witnesses said that flames leapt into the sky and there was a bright light before the explosion was heard.\n\nThe villagers had formed a 'peace committee' which was holding a meeting in a mosque when the blast occurred. The roof of the mosque caved in but none of the people attending the meeting were seriously injured. More than twenty surrounding houses were destroyed. People became trapped in collapsed buildings. In the darkness, vehicle headlights were used to search for victims. The blast was felt from 11 miles (18\u00a0kilometers) away.\n\nBy the day after the blast, no group had claimed responsibility for the bombing.  According to analysts, this is frequently the case after an attack has killed many civilians.  Pakistani security analyst retired Lieutenant General Talat Masood stated that attack was most likely carried out in retaliation by Taliban.  He said \"Definitely these are militant elements from North Waziristan and Taliban who have been very angry because the military had had a successful operation in Lakki Marwat and been able to clean up the place.\"\n\n==Reactions==\n\nThe village elders stated after the attack that they would continue opposing the Taliban.  The head of the tribal council stated \"Such attacks will only strengthen our resolve \u2013 being Pashtun, revenge is the only answer to the gruesome killings.\"\n\nAltaf Hussain chief of Muttahida Qaumi Movement condemned the blast and called it an attempt to worsen Pakistan's situation further. The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government has announced Rs300,000 (US$3500, \u20ac2500) compensation for the family of each deceased and Rs100,000 (US$1200, \u20ac800) for each of the injured.\n\n===International reactions===\n*: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton released a statement: \"The United States strongly condemns today's terrorist attack on civilians in Pakistan, and we offer our condolences to the families of the victims and all the people of Pakistan. The Pakistani people have seen terrorists target schools, markets, mosques, and now a volleyball game. The United States will continue to stand with the people of Pakistan in their efforts to chart their own future free from fear and intimidation, and will support their efforts to combat violent extremism and bolster democracy.\"\n*: The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, condemned the attack in a statement: \"I am shocked by the news of [the] brutal bomb attack at a sports event in Lakki Marwat that killed and injured a large number of innocent civilians. [...] In this difficult moment, the EU reaffirms its support for the government and the population of Pakistan.\"\n*: Dmitry Medvedev President of Russia expressed his condolences: \"I was shocked to learn about a new crime committed by extremists \u2013 a bloody terrorist act during a volleyball game in the town of Lakki Marwat.

{"title":"Nadahan wedding bombing","article":"The Nadahan wedding bombing was a suicide bombing on a wedding party, which occurred on 9 June 2010 at around 21:00 local time (16:30 GMT) in the village of Nadahan in Arghandab District of Kandahar Province, Afghanistan. The attack killed at least 40 people and wounded at least 77 others, making it one of the worst suicide attacks of the year. One source described it as \"the most lethal attack in the south in recent memory\".\n\n== Bombing ==\nThe explosion occurred in a men-only area of the wedding party where guests were eating. A white-clothed boy under 13 walked in and approached within  of the dinner tables before fiddling with the bomb attached to his vest. There was a ball of fire and smoke. The female guests were in another building. Some of those killed were children. The groom was wounded and his brother killed.\n\nAt least three Afghan police officers were at the wedding. Some suggested the attack was intended for 17 of the guests who were members of an anti-Taliban guard group, which had once been encouraged by United States Special Operations Forces before they gave up on it. Blood donations were requested via television. The coffins of the dead were lined adjacent to the mortuary.\n\n== Investigation ==\nA group of investigators was sent to the village by Afghanistan's Interior Ministry.\n\nNATO issued a statement saying none of their soldiers were behind it. The Taliban were instead blamed by the NATO troops; however, the Taliban stated that they were not responsible for the attack, even condemning it as \"a brutal act\". Deputy commander of NATO forces, Lt. Gen. Nick Parker, described it as \"ruthless violence\" and claimed these were \"sickening and indiscriminate tactics to try to intimidate the citizens of Afghanistan\".\n\nA military spokesperson representing the United States said the attack had not been an airstrike carried out by his country. He dismissed speculation to the contrary as \"Taliban misinformation\".\n\n== Response ==\nPresident Hamid Karzai stated his condemnation and requested \"a thorough investigation\". Karzai, in the presence of the United Kingdom's Prime Minister David Cameron (who was visiting Afghanistan for the first official time), labelled it \"a crime of massive inhuman proportions\".\n\nTooryalai Wesa, governor of Kandahar Province, spoke at a news conference in Nadahan after the attack and demonstrated a piece of metal he had found which he said resembled part of a suicide bomb.\n\nUnited Nations Special Representative for Afghanistan Staffan de Mistura said it was an \"outrageous act\" and that \"to specifically target people who were gathering at a moment of happiness to celebrate a wedding shows a total disregard for civilian life\".\n\n== References ==","urls":["http:\/\/thestar.com.my\/news\/story.asp?file=\/2010\/6\/10\/worldupdates\/2010-06-10T071850Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-491859-1&sec=Worldupdates","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110622034144\/http:\/\/thestar.com.my\/news\/story.asp?file=%2F2010%2F6%2F10%2Fworldupdates%2F2010-06-10T071850Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-491859-1&sec=Worldupdates","https:\/\/ottawacitizen.com\/news\/Bombing+Afghan+wedding+kills\/3139606\/story.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100615163801\/http:\/\/www.ottawacitizen.com\/news\/Bombing+Afghan+wedding+kills\/3139606\/story.html","http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/news\/nationworld\/world\/la-fg-afghan-wedding-20100611,0,5767263.story","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/world\/south_asia\/10280157.stm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100610031708\/http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/world\/south_asia\/10280157.stm","http:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/Afghan-wedding-attacks-aimed-at-anti-Taliban-guests\/Article1-556140.aspx","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100615152616\/http:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/Afghan-wedding-attacks-aimed-at-anti-Taliban-guests\/Article1-556140.aspx","https:\/\/www.washingtontimes.com\/news\/2010\/jun\/10\/suicide-bomb-kills-40-at-afghan-wedding\/","http:\/\/english.aljazeera.net\/news\/asia\/2010\/06\/201061010921894475.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100610184912\/http:\/\/english.aljazeera.net\/news\/asia\/2010\/06\/201061010921894475.html"]}
{"title":"2010 Istanbul bombing","article":"The 2010 Istanbul bomb blast was a suicide bombing which took place on Taksim Square in Istanbul, Turkey on 31 October 2010. The bomb resulted in at least 32 injuries, 15 of whom were police officers and was claimed by a Kurdish secessionist group known as the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks (TAK).\n\n==Attack==\nThe explosion occurred in Taksim Square on the European side of the city. The blast was reportedly a suicide bombing, targeting the riot officers and police vehicles typically stationed in the area. Multiple additional explosive devices were reportedly discovered at the scene of the incident after bomb squads examined the area.\n\nSeventeen of the injured were civilians, while fifteen were police. Two of the wounded were reported to be in serious condition.\n\n==Responsibility==\nInitially, there were no official confirmations as to who carried out the attack, though many speculated that left-wing groups or the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) were responsible. However, PKK never confirmed that they had organised the attack.\n\nThe day was significant as it was the day of final celebrations for Republic Day, marking the declaration of independence for the Turkish Republic, and Turkish President Abdullah G\u00fcl was due to arrive at a nearby location. The timing could also be significant since a unilateral ceasefire by the PKK declared two months earlier was due to expire on 31 October. The PKK, however, denied responsibility, with its spokesman, Roj Qandil, saying he had no \"idea\" about the bombing. The PKK also declared it was extending the unilateral ceasefire till the 2011 Turkish general election.\n\nThe TAK released a statement on their website claiming responsibility for the attack. The statement said that \"We as TAK claim responsibility for the action carried out against the police force of Turkish fascism at Istanbul's Taksim Square on 31 Oct 2010.\" The PKK denied involvement in the attack.\n\n==Reactions==\n*Turkey \u2013 Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said \"Those who threaten Turkey's peace, security and development will not be tolerated.\"\n* \u2013 The Kurdistan Regional Government condemned the attack in a statement saying \"The Kurdistan Region Presidency strongly condemns the terrorist attack that was perpetrated in central Istanbul on Sunday, wounding a large number of civilians and policemen. We send our sympathies to the victims and their families.\"\n*Kuwait \u2013 Kuwait's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammad Al-Salem Al-Sabah sent a message to Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu denouncing the attack as a \"terrorist crime.\"\n*South Africa \u2013 President Jacob Zuma stated: \"As the government and the people of South Africa, we reach out in thoughts and prayers to the government and peoples of Turkey and wishing those wounded a speedy recovery. Violence and any other form of terrorist attacks will not advance world peace and stability in any country.\"\n*United States \u2013 United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned the bombing, while also pledging to continue working with Turkey to \"combat violent extremism. This is a shocking crime and the people of the United States stand in solidarity with our friends, the people of Turkey.\"\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-europe-11660795","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20101101055420\/http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-europe-11660795","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2010\/11\/04\/us-turkey-blast-responsibility-idUSTRE6A32H820101104","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2010\/WORLD\/europe\/10\/31\/turkey.blast\/index.html?hpt=T1","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20101103030035\/http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2010\/WORLD\/europe\/10\/31\/turkey.blast\/index.html?hpt=T1","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2010\/oct\/31\/suicide-bomber-turkey-istanbul","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20101103075115\/http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2010\/oct\/31\/suicide-bomber-turkey-istanbul","http:\/\/www.presstv.ir\/detail\/149004.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20101102223914\/http:\/\/www.presstv.ir\/detail\/149004.html","http:\/\/www.straitstimes.com\/BreakingNews\/World\/Story\/STIStory_597580.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20101102225006\/http:\/\/www.straitstimes.com\/BreakingNews\/World\/Story\/STIStory_597580.html","http:\/\/english.aljazeera.net\/news\/europe\/2010\/10\/2010103185656175601.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20101031122135\/http:\/\/english.aljazeera.net\/news\/europe\/2010\/10\/2010103185656175601.html","http:\/\/www.techzone360.com\/\/news\/2010\/11\/01\/5106702.htm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150212002019\/http:\/\/www.techzone360.com\/\/news\/2010\/11\/01\/5106702.htm","http:\/\/english.aljazeera.net\/news\/europe\/2010\/11\/2010111152255237544.html","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2010\/11\/04\/us-turkey-blast-responsibility-idUSTRE6A32H820101104","http:\/\/www.krg.org\/articles\/detail.asp?anr=37572&rnr=&areanr=60&smap=02010000&lngnr=12","http:\/\/www.thepeninsulaqatar.com\/latest-news\/131129-kuwait-condemns-istanbul-bombing-.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20101102234838\/http:\/\/www.thepeninsulaqatar.com\/latest-news\/131129-kuwait-condemns-istanbul-bombing-.html","http:\/\/7thspace.com\/headlines\/362257\/south_africa_zuma_condemns_turkey_terror_attack_.html"]}
{"title":"2010 Ahmadiyya mosques massacre","article":"The May 2010 Lahore attacks, also referred to as the Lahore massacre, occurred on 28 May 2010, in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan, during Friday prayers. 94 people were killed and more than 120 others were injured in nearly simultaneous attacks against two mosques of the minority Ahmadiyya community. After the initial attack, a hostage situation lasted for hours. Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, as well as their Punjab wing, claimed responsibility for the attacks and were also blamed by the Pakistani Police.\n\n==Background==\nThe Ahmadiyya movement was started in 1889 and follows the teachings of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad whom they believe was sent by God as the Promised Messiah and Mahdi prophesied in Islam \"to end religious wars, condemn bloodshed and re-institute morality, justice and peace.\" It is estimated there are between 3-4 million Ahmadis in Pakistan.\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslims have previously been targeted by Sunni groups, while they have also suffered discrimination in Pakistan in the past, most significantly during the Lahore riots of 1953. Pakistan does not recognize the Ahmadis as Muslim, because it is claimed the latter do not recognize the finality of the prophethood of Muhammad, a core tenet of mainstream Islam. They were declared non-Muslim in Pakistan in 1973 by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and were legally banned from identifying themselves as such in 1984 during General Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization as per Ordinance XX, despite Ahmadis calling themselves Muslim and following the rituals of Islam.  The ban occurred when jihadist ideology became embedded in Pakistan's state and education system. The media in Pakistan are legally barred from referring to an Ahmadi place of worship as a mosque.\n\nHuman rights groups in Pakistan said that they had warned of threats to the Ahmadi community center in Model Town for more than a year, saying the government took inadequate steps to provide security. The UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Asma Jahangir; an independent expert on minority issues, Gay McDougall; and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Philip Alston, claimed that because Ahmadis have been declared non-Muslims and have been subject to a number of restrictions, in many instances institutionalized discrimination, opinion makers are emboldened to seek to fuel hatred, and perpetrators of attacks against religious minorities find cannon fodder. According to Minority Rights Group International, Pakistan had the world's highest increase of threats against minorities last year and was ranked the sixth most dangerous country for minorities overall.\n\nLahore has also been the site of various interval attacks by militants, including on visiting Sri Lankan cricketers and the police academy, amongst others.\n\n===Follow-up===\nAn Ahmadi man was stabbed to death, while his son was there, watching, when a trespasser attacked them. It was said that the assailant threatened not to leave any Ahmadi alive after hearing a mullah's sermon on television.\n\nGunmen also attacked a hospital, on the same day, in which some of the injured from the mosque attack were being treated. It is unclear whether the gunmen were trying to free one of their own who was also being treated in the hospital or trying to kill him. The gunmen indiscriminately started to fire in the hospital, killing twelve people.\n\n==Attack==\nThe perpetrators lobbed grenades and started firing as they attacked mosques of the minority Ahmadi Muslim community in two different residential neighborhoods. The near simultaneous attacks were at Darul Zikr, Garhi Shahu and Bait-al Noor. Lack of security meant they easily infiltrated both the Mosques in Lahore Model Town and in Garhi Shahu, 15\u00a0km apart.\n\nThe attackers at Garhi Shahu, including two would-be suicide bombers, entered the mosque without any resistance, before storming into the prayer halls firing guns, throwing grenades. The assault at Model Town involved two attackers opening fire on worshippers before exploding hand grenades. The attackers did not take any hostages and killed indiscriminately.\n\nThe Elite Police arrived once the attackers had entered the mosques but did not launch an operation, while the two attackers  blew themselves up after the attack in Garhi Shahu which lasted four hours. Two militants were involved in each of the attacks.\n\nIn Model Town, both the attackers were captured alive as they were overpowered by some of the worshippers; one of the attackers was captured on the first floor by some of the young members of the Ahmadiyya Jammat i.e. Khuddam, and one was overpowered in the main hall on the ground floor by a worshiper who was an ex-army officer. At one time up to 3000 people were reported to be in the mosque during the attack. This is considered the deadliest attack on Ahmadi Muslims.\n\n===Funeral===\nMany victims of the two attacks were taken to the city of Rabwah, the headquarters of Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Pakistan, for funeral services. However, it was noted that ministers, politicians and prominent figures did not attend the funeral services, although many made statements condemning the attacks.  Media were absent from the burial ceremonies. There were also complaints that authorities did not provide adequate security for the funeral ceremony at Rabwah. Observers said this was largely due to the fear of a backlash as the Ahmadis have the legal status of \"non-Muslims\" in Pakistan. A politician said that \"only to call a dead Ahmadi a martyr is enough to send you behind bars for three years under the laws of the land.\"\n\n==Investigation==\n\nRana Sana Ullah Khan, the minister of law in Punjab, said the attackers stayed with the Tablighi Jamaat, a Muslim missionary group. Its headquarters are in Raiwind, on the outskirts of Lahore. He also added that he believed the attackers, who operated as commandos, had been trained in Waziristan.\n\nOn 5 July 2010, Pakistani police arrested six men, members of the banned group Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, believed to be linked to the attack. The men were in possession of 18,000\u00a0kg of explosives, 21 grenades, six AK-47 rifles, as well as bomb-making material, and four of the men are alleged to have been logistical supporters to the attack.\n\n==Responsibility==\nThe Punjabi Taliban, a subset wing of the Pakistani Taliban reportedly laid claim to the attacks. It is allegedly composed of groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi,  which were previously sponsored by the Government of Pakistan.  An SMS sent to many journalists and signed by the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan as well as the Punjabi wing of Al-Qaeda stated that \"This is a final warning to the Ahmedi community to leave Pakistan or prepare for death at the hands of the Prophet Muhammad's devotees.\"\n\nThe Lahore police also stated that the attacks were carried out by six militants belonging to Pakistani Taliban, who were trained in the town of  Miranshah in North Waziristan.  They were aged between 17 and 28 and arrived in Lahore on May 21.\n\nIt has been claimed that the reason the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan attacked Ahmadi mosques was because Al Qaeda wished to gain public support in Pakistan. Al Qaeda have been launching attacks on Shia congregations in the past, but a majority of Sunnis did not endorse these attacks. Brigadier Saad said that by attacking a \"community that is not liked by most of (sic) Sunni Muslims belonging to [the] Deobandi and Barelvi schools of thought, the terror network has attempted to win some sort of support from these groups\" and that also because of the attack \"at least close to two million those who study at Deobandi madrassahs across Pakistan would definitely have some kind of \u201cfavorable\u201d opinion about al Qaeda.\" Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan vowed to launch more such attacks on what it called \"infidels.\"\n\n==Reactions==\nIn a joint statement with three United Nations human rights experts, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, said \"Members of this religious community have faced continuous threats, discrimination and violent attacks in Pakistan. There is a real risk that similar violence might happen again unless advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence is adequately addressed. The Government must take every step to ensure the security of members of all religious minorities and their places of worship so as to prevent any recurrence of today\u2019s dreadful incident.\" Ban's spokesperson expressed condemnation and extended his condolences to the families of the victims and to the Government.\n\nThe United States ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, issued an unusually strong statement saying Pakistan had witnessed an increase in \"provocative statements that promote intolerance and are an incitement to extremist violence.\"\n\nAn editorial published in Dawn condemned the attacks, commenting that \"Bigotry in this country has been decades in the making and is expressed in a variety of ways. Violence by individuals or groups against those who hold divergent views may be the most despicable manifestation of such prejudice but it is by no means the only one. Religious minorities in Pakistan have not only been shunted to the margins of society but also face outright persecution on a regular basis.\"\n\nIn a statement made after the attacks the Interior Minister of Pakistan Rehman Malik admitted that militant groups were deeply entrenched in the southern part of Punjab and were destabilizing the country.  He, however, ruled out the possibility of military offensive in Punjab against these militants.\n\n==See also==\n\n*Blasphemy law in Pakistan\n*Sectarian violence in Pakistan\n*2009 Gojra riots\n*List of terrorist incidents in 2010\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n*  Alislam.org \u2013 Head of Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat Responds to Terrorists' Attacks in Lahore (Official Statement) \u2013 Terrorist attacks on Ahmadi Mosques in Pakistan\n*  Who are the Ahmadi (BBC)\n*  In pictures: Lahore attacks (BBC)\n*  Video: Attackers Strike Sect Mosques in Pakistan (Associated Press)","urls":["http:\/\/www.alislam.org\/egazette\/press-release\/clarification-86-ahmadis-died-in-the-lahore-attacks\/","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/05\/29\/world\/asia\/29pstan.html","http:\/\/english.aljazeera.net\/news\/asia\/2010\/05\/2010528923401784.html","http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/World\/Asia-South-Central\/2010\/0528\/Why-Taliban-attacks-two-Muslim-minority-mosques-in-Pakistan","http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2010\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/05\/28\/pakistan.violence\/index.html?hpt=T2","https:\/\/www.un.org\/apps\/news\/story.asp?NewsID=34849&Cr=&Cr1=","http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/2009\/0803\/p06s10-wosc.html","http:\/\/www.alislam.org\/egazette\/press-release\/murder-of-another-innocent-ahmadi-in-pakistan\/","http:\/\/english.aljazeera.net\/news\/asia\/2010\/05\/2010531194925419577.html","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/south_asia\/8714894.stm","http:\/\/geo.tv\/5-28-2010\/65748.htm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100531191210\/http:\/\/www.geo.tv\/5-28-2010\/65748.htm","https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/asia\/worshippers-slaughtered-in-deadly-final-warning-1986188.html","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/world\/south_asia\/10181380.stm","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2010\/may\/28\/gunmen-mosques-lahore","http:\/\/www.dnaindia.com\/world\/report-pak-ministers-prefer-to-keep-away-from-ahmadiyyas-funeral-1389669","http:\/\/www.dnaindia.com\/world\/report_pak-ministers-prefer-to-keep-away-from-ahmadiyyas-funeral_1389669","http:\/\/english.aljazeera.net\/news\/asia\/2010\/07\/20107514102086232.html","http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/printout\/0,8816,1992630,00.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/05\/30\/world\/asia\/30pstan.html","http:\/\/tribune.com.pk\/story\/17484\/al-qaeda-wants-to-regain-public-support-in-pakistan\/","http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/wps\/wcm\/connect\/dawn-content-library\/dawn\/the-newspaper\/editorial\/19-culture-of-intolerance-050-hh-12","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100602123101\/http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/wps\/wcm\/connect\/dawn-content-library\/dawn\/the-newspaper\/editorial\/19-culture-of-intolerance-050-hh-12","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/06\/03\/world\/asia\/03pstan.html","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/world\/south_asia\/10228268.stm"]}
{"title":"Domodedovo International Airport bombing","article":"The Domodedovo International Airport bombing was a suicide bombing in the international arrival hall of Moscow's Domodedovo International, in Domodedovsky District, Moscow Oblast, on 24 January 2011.\n\nThe bombing killed 37 people and injured 173 others, including 86 who had to be hospitalised. Of the casualties, 31 died at the scene, three later in hospitals, one en route to a hospital, one on the 2nd February after having been put in a coma, and another on the 24th February after being hospitalised in grave condition.\n\nRussia's Federal Investigative Committee later identified the suicide bomber as a 20-year-old from the North Caucasus, and said that the attack was aimed \"first and foremost\" at foreign citizens.\n\n==Background==\nDomodedovo International is located  southeast of central Moscow and is Russia's largest airport, with over 22 million passengers passing through in 2010. It is heavily used by foreign workers and tourists.\n\nIn 2004, two aircraft which had just taken off from Domodedovo were bombed by female Chechen suicide bombers. The incident resulted in an extensive step-up of security at the airport, including full body scanners.\n\nThe city of Moscow had seen a number of significant attacks in the years prior to the incident. In 2004, two separate attacks on the Moscow Metro, one by a male suicide bomber on 6 February and another by a female suicide bomber on 31 August; in 2006, 13 people were killed in a market bombing; and in March 2010, at least 40 people were killed in suicide bombings on the Moscow Metro.\n\n==Bombing==\nThe explosion affected the baggage-claim area of the airport's international arrivals hall. Some reports have suggested that the explosion was the work of a suicide bomber, with investigators saying the explosion was caused by an \"improvised device packed with shrapnel, pieces of chopped wire\" and the force equivalent to between two and five kilograms of TNT. Russia's chief investigator has stated the explosion was the work of terrorists. Investigators found a male head and believed it might have been that of the suicide bomber.\n\nAccording to Russian newspaper accounts, the bombing was carried out by two suicide bombers, a man and a woman. Another three accomplices who had kept their distance from the blast were sought, but the source of the attack remained unclear. Security experts speculated that the attackers may have been Islamist militants from the North Caucasus, though this was not confirmed. The attack may have been an act of revenge for recent anti-militant operations, including the killing of Pakhrudin Gadzhiyev in Dagestan the previous Friday. Gadzhiyev was suspected of organizing suicide attacks in 2010.\n\n==Victims==\nThe first identified casualty was 29-year-old Ukrainian playwright Anna Yablonskaya, author of more than a dozen plays. Half an hour before the explosion, Yablonskaya had arrived on a flight from her native city of Odessa to receive an award at a ceremony for young playwrights established by Cinema Art magazine.\n\nOn 25 January, the Ministry of Emergency Situations (EMERCOM) published the list of casualties. Twenty-six out of 35 dead were identified.\n\nAccording to Vladimir Markin, a representative of the Russian Federation Investigative Committee, two British citizens died in the blast, however, the BBC in a later article mentioned only one British citizen among the dead, as well as one German citizen. Gordon Cousland, an analyst for CACI, was confirmed to be a British citizen, while another victim, Kirill Bodrashov, who had been listed as a British citizen by EMERCOM, was a Russian citizen who lived in London for several years. The Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that a Bulgarian man was among the casualties; however, it was later clarified that the ethnic Bulgarian who had died in the blast actually had Austrian citizenship.\n\nAccording to the Slovak embassy in Moscow, Slovak actress Zuzana Fialov\u00e1 was injured in the blast.\n\n\n\n==Aftermath==\nA number of flights originally bound for Domodedovo were redirected to Moscow's Vnukovo International Airport following the attack. Russian authorities directed all of the country's airports to immediately begin inspecting all visitors before allowing them to enter the airports. However, this practice was ruled illegal by an appellate court in June 2011. The express commuter trains that run from Domodedovo to the city were operating free of charge. The trains from other Moscow airports, where flights originally scheduled to land at Domodedovo were diverted to, were also running free of charge.\n\nAt Domodedovo, the surge of emergency vehicles caused public transportation delays. In response, citizens volunteered to carpool passengers to Moscow, and taxi drivers slashed their rates.\n\nThe blast was followed by a drop of almost two percent at the Moscow stock exchange (MICEX).\n\n==Responsibility==\nOn 8 February 2011, a faction of the Caucasus Emirate led by Doku Umarov claimed responsibility for the attack, and threatened further attacks. In the video in which Doku Umarov claimed responsibility for the bombing, he took the opportunity to lash out, calling the major powers in the world \"satanic\". He criticised the US and Russia for being hypocrites, reasoning that if they actually followed their own principles, they would have to surrender world power to China, due to the senior status of Chinese culture and religion. He said, according to the logic of Russia and America, \"China should then rule the world. They have the largest and most ancient cultures\". He also attacked the US, Russia, Britain, and Israel for oppressing Muslims.\n\n==Investigation==\nIn the aftermath of the explosion, Russia's Investigative Committee stated that the bombing was aimed \"first and foremost\" at foreign citizens, adding that \"it was by no means an accident that the act of terror was committed in the international arrivals hall\".\n\nOn 7 February 2011, Russian officials identified the suspected suicide bomber as 20-year-old Magomed Yevloyev, born in the village of Ali-yurt, Ingushetia (not to be confused with the journalist of the same name killed in 2008).\n\nMagomed Yevloyev's 16-year-old sister Fatima Yevloyeva and friend Umar Aushev were suspected of collaboration in the Domodedovo attack and detained in February 2011. They were released a few months later, but remained under investigation for illegal possession of firearms. In September, Yevloyeva and Aushev were no longer considered suspects, and were cleared of all charges.\n\nIn February and March 2011, Russian law enforcement agencies conducted special operations against members of the Caucasus Emirate in Ingushetia, during which they arrested several associates of Magomed Yevloyev, including Islam and Ilez Yandiyev.\n\nBy October 2011, four alleged associates of Yevloyev had been arrested: the Yandiyevs, Bashir Khamkhoyev, and Akhmed Yevloyev, Magomed's 15-year-old brother, who had allegedly helped assemble the bomb. They were charged with terrorism, formation of or participation in illegal armed bands, assault on a police officer, and illegal possession of firearms and explosives. Doku Umarov, who has claimed responsibility for masterminding the attack, has not been apprehended.\n\nA year after the event, in January 2012, the Investigative Committee reported that the investigation was complete, and the final version of the indictment against Yevloyev, Khamkhoyev, and the Yandiyevs was to be brought by March 2012.\n\nThe trial in the case ended on 11 November 2013. Yandiyevs and Khamkhoyev were given life sentences, and Akhmed Yevloyev was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.\n\nA separate investigation was conducted into the lax or inefficient security measures that were in place at the Domodedovo airport at the time of the attack.\n\nIt was reported that Doku Umarov had planned to follow the Domodedovo attack with two additional bombings in Moscow. An attack in Moscow's Red Square was planned for New Year's Eve, 2011, but it was foiled when the suicide bomber accidentally triggered the bomb in a hotel room in Kuzminki District, killing herself in the explosion. Another bombing was to be carried out by a Slavic Russian couple who had converted to Islam, and become members of Caucasus Emirate. However, they were unable to leave Dagestan, and instead committed two separate suicide bombings in the village of Gubden on 14 February 2011, killing two policemen and injuring 27 people.\n\n==Trial==\nOn 11 November 2013, four men received jail terms for the offences including commissioning an act of terror, murder and attempted murder. Islam and Ilez Yandiyev and Bashir Khamkhoyev were sentenced to life terms in a penal colony, while Akhmed Yevloyev was jailed for 10 years as he was a minor at the time of the attack. The government's investigators said that the bombing was carried out by Magomed Yevloyev, Akhmed's brother, on the orders of the leader of the Caucasus Emirate, Doku Umarov. The convicted were accused of sheltering the bomber in Nazran, Ingushetia, providing him with money and putting him on a bus to Moscow in preparation for the attack. The investigators also said that his attack was plotted at a camp run by the Caucasus Emirate in Ingushetia.\n\n==Response==\n===Domestic===\n;Political\nPresident Dmitry Medvedev apportioned some blame to poor security at Domodedovo and sacked several officials \u2013 said to include a regional transport chief and a Moscow police deputy head; he also announced that he would delay his departure to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin condemned the bombing as an \"abominable crime,\" and vowed that \"retribution is inevitable.\"\n\nIn an interview with NTV on 31 January, the President of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov said that the bombing was most likely staged by the USA; he also previously had made statements in which he blamed the US for staging terrorist acts in Russia or for providing financial and technical support to its perpetrators. Senior Russian lawmakers Alexander Torshin and Vladimir Kolesnikov blamed the government of Georgia and its Ossetian agents for the bombing, an allegation that was swiftly condemned by the Foreign Ministry of Georgia as a \"purposeful provocation\".\n\nThe Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, the former separatist government in exile (which split from the other half which would become the Caucasus Emirate in 2007), released a statement sending condolences to the victims, suggesting the attackers may have been desperate, traumatized and hopeless, and strongly condemning the bombing.\n\n;Apolitical\nA number of flights originally bound for Domodedovo were redirected to Moscow's Vnukovo International Airport following the attack. Russian authorities contacted all the Russian airports to immediately start inspecting all visitors before allowing them to enter the airport buildings.\n\nVolunteers drove their own private cars to the airport to help transport passengers into Moscow.\n\nThe blast was followed by a drop of almost two percent at the Moscow stock exchange (MICEX).\n\n===International===\nMany world leaders expressed their condolences to Russia following the attack.\n\nEuropean Union president Herman Van Rompuy said that those responsible for the attack must be punished. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen also expressed condolences.\n\nThe Brazilian Ministry of External Relations stated that \"the Brazilian Government is saddened to learn of the attack at Moscow's Domodedovo airport, which resulted in the loss of many lives\". According to the note, the Brazilian Government, \"in denouncing the action of radical groups that resort to violent acts against civilians, reiterates its staunch condemnation of such attacks, regardless of its motivations\".\n\nPrime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu expressed condolences to the people of Russia and the Russian government on behalf of the people of Israel: \"Terrorism is global and the response to terror must be global.\"\n\nCondolences were sent by:\n* President of France Nicolas Sarkozy\n* Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel\n* Lithuanian Foreign Minister Audronius A\u017eubalis\n* Slovakian President Ivan Ga\u0161parovi\u010d and Prime minister Iveta Radi\u010dov\u00e1\n* British Prime Minister David Cameron\n** British Foreign Secretary William Hague\n* President of the United States Barack Obama\n\nOthers included leaders or officials from: Abkhazia, Afghanistan, Albania, Angola, Armenia, Australia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Cuba, Finland, Georgia, Hungary, India, Iran, Mexico, North Korea, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Palestine, Poland, Romania, South Ossetia, Syria, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates,

{"title":"2011 Inter-Continental Hotel Kabul attack","article":"On 28 June 2011, an attack on the Inter-Continental Hotel, Kabul by gunmen and suicide bombers, and an ensuing five-hour siege, left at least 21 people dead, including all 9 attackers. Responsibility was claimed by the Taliban.\n\n==Background==\nSixty to seventy guests were believed to be staying at the hotel at the time of the attacks. Thirty provincial government officials were staying at the hotel to attend a briefing about the transition of security responsibilities from the U.S. Military to the Afghan security forces. Most of the hotel's guests were in the hotel's dining hall at the time of the attack. Initial reports suggested that a wedding party may also have been hosted in one of the dance halls.\n\n==The attack==\nThe attackers passed three security checkpoints and made their way to the rear of the hotel under concealment of thick vegetation. The assault on the hotel began at 10:00\u00a0p.m. local time armed with assault rifles, hand grenades, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, machine guns, and anti-aircraft weapons. Armed Afghan law enforcement personnel fled the area and failed to engage the attackers. Nine attackers were captured on surveillance camera entering through the rear hotel garden where only two guards were stationed during a dinner for hotel guests. Suicide vests were detonated at the entrance to the hotel and on the second floor. Two dance halls were destroyed in the initial attack. The attackers then ascended to the fifth floor. Exchanges of weapon fire between law enforcement occurred until the early morning hours.\n\nHotel guests were told to barricade themselves in their rooms, while others escaped by jumping from the hotel's windows.\n\n==Termination of the attack==\nEntry forces ascended the first two floors killing a militant in the process. The security forces attempted to disarm the explosive vest the attacker was wearing. The attackers took up firing positions on the hotel roof when the fight entered its climactic end. Three combatants on the hotel roof were attacked by two of three circling NATO helicopters. The militants may have been killed in the strike or may have detonated their vests. One U.S. Blackhawk helicopter carried International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) snipers while an MC-12W Liberty and an MQ-1 Predator remotely piloted aircraft provided critical aerial surveillance. Afghan policemen could not be coaxed by police chief Mohammad Ayoub Salangi to enter the building after the attackers were killed. At one point, an Afghan intelligence official informed the press that it believed it had eliminated all but one militant. One injured suicide bomber hid in a hotel room and ambushed and killed a Spanish pilot after the declared conclusion of operations.\n\nElectricity to the hotel was restored after the end of military operations, and a scheduled briefing on the transition of security responsibilities from the U.S. Military to the Afghan security forces proceeded the next day.\n\n==Victims==\nAmong the wounded were five Afghan policemen and thirteen civilians. Five hotel staff including one hotel security guard and a hotel chef, and three policemen were killed.\n\n==Perpetrators==\nTaliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid claimed Taliban responsibility for the attack and lauded the militants that killed \"dozens of the foreign and local top-level officials\". The Long War Journal reported that the attack was carried out by the \"Kabul Attack Network\". According to the Journal, the network was an ad-hoc organization with insurgents and operatives from Afghan and Pakistani Taliban groups, the Haqqani network, Hizb-i-Islami Gulbuddin, and with support from Lashkar-e-Taiba and al Qaeda. The network is led by Dawood (also spelled Daud), the Taliban's shadow governor for Kabul, and Taj Mir Jawad, a leader in the Haqqani network. The Journal also stated that the organization is sometimes assisted by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency.\n\nThe ISAF believes that the operation was supplied by the Haqqani network. Ismail Jan, Deputy to the senior Haqqani commander, was killed in an airstrike in Paktia province which borders Pakistan's FATA a day after the attack.\n\n==See also==\n* 2018 Inter-Continental Hotel Kabul attack\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB10001424052702304447804576413991003487976","http:\/\/english.aljazeera.net\/news\/asia\/2011\/06\/2011629122328109278.html","http:\/\/www.nzherald.co.nz\/nz\/news\/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10735590","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2011\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/06\/28\/afghanistan.kabul.attack\/","http:\/\/www.smh.com.au\/world\/reluctance-to-engage-in-hotel-battle-raises-questions-of-afghan-preparedness-20110630-1gt2r.html","http:\/\/news.xinhuanet.com\/english2010\/world\/2011-06\/29\/c_13955160.htm","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-south-asia-13953883","http:\/\/www.voanews.com\/english\/news\/10-People-Reportedly-Killed-in-Attack-on-Luxury-Kabul-Hotel-124676999.html","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2011\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/06\/29\/afghanistan.hotel.coalition.role\/","https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/worldnews\/asia\/afghanistan\/8606417\/Barack-Obama-warns-our-work-is-not-done-after-Taliban-hotel-siege.html","http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/news\/international\/suicide-bombers-attack-top-hotel-in-afghan-capital-1.370119","http:\/\/picayuneitem.com\/international\/x652254345\/Afghan-attack-left-mass-of-bodies-at-luxury-hotel","http:\/\/www.longwarjournal.org\/archives\/2011\/06\/isaf_airstrike_kills.php","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2011\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/06\/30\/afghanistan.kabul.attack\/"]}
{"title":"23 July 2012 Iraq attacks","article":"The 23 July 2012 Iraq attacks were a series of simultaneous, coordinated bombings and shootings that struck the Iraqi security force and Shi'ite Muslim communities. At least 116 people were killed and 299 wounded in the attacks, making them the deadliest attacks in the country since May 2010. The Islamic State of Iraq claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\n== Background ==\nThe attacks occurred about seven months following the withdrawal of the United States military forces from the area, leaving the security of the country in the hands of the Iraqi security forces.\n\n== Attacks ==\nNumerous attacks were conducted within hours of each other on 23 July 2012 across thirteen different cities in Iraq. Naharnet reported the number of towns and cities attacked as eighteen. The number of attacks, on the other hand, was given to be thirty. Two more attacks occurred late on 23 July 2012, increasing the number of attacks to thirty-two. Rod Nordland stated that the number of attacks was forty. The major targets of the attacks were security forces, government buildings and Shia Muslim neighbourhoods.\n\nThe first attack took place on an army base in Saladin Governorate around dawn. In Taji, nearly  north of Baghdad, a series of bombs around a number of homes went off simultaneously; as police arrived and residents began searching the wreckage for survivors, a suicide bomber detonated himself, killing more. At least 41 people were killed in this attack, considered the worst of the overall event. A car bomb exploded near a government building in Sadr City in Baghdad, killing 16. At least five car bombs went off in Kirkuk. The insurgents attacked a base in Dhuluiya, killing 15 soldiers. In al-Husseiniya, a predominantly Shiite suburb in northeastern Baghdad and in Mosul, a total of six people were killed in bombing attacks. Explosion in Yarmouk, another neighborhood of Baghdad, killed at least four people and injured another 24. Nearly five people were also killed and 22 or 25 injured when a car bomb exploded near a busy market in Diwaniya. Of all the sites attacked, only Diwaniya is an undisputed Shiite territory. There were checkpoint shootings and bomb blasts in the ethnically mixed Diyala Governorate, resulting in 11 dead and 40 wounded. In the western city of Heet, a car bombing occurred near an army patrol, killing one soldier and injuring 10 others. The other towns and cities suffered from bombings were Saadiya, Khan Beni-Saad, Tuz Khurmatu, Dibis, Samarra and Dujail.\n\nIn addition to all these attacks took place daytime, there were two more attacks late in the day. One of these attacks was a car bomb blast near a caf\u00e9 in the Shi'ite Ameen district in southeastern Baghdad, killing six men and wounding 24. The second was a roadside bombing near Baquba, a city northeast of Baghdad. The second blast killed three people and injured seven others.\n\n== Perpetrators ==\nThough no group claimed responsibility immediately after the killings, the attacks were believed by Iraqi officials, media and specialists to be orchestrated by Al Qaeda, seeking to gain control of the country following the departure of the American forces. An announcement purported to be from Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the current leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq known as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), had been broadcast on 21 July 2012; in the announcement, al-Baghdadi declared the intention towards a new offensive to retake the country, a move claimed to be supported by the Sunni population of Iraq. Previous attacks that have targeted the security forces have been attributed to al-Qaeda.\n\nOn 25 July 2012, the Islamic State of Iraq posted a statement on radical Islamist websites, indicating that it was responsible for the recent attacks, calling the attacks \"Destroying the Walls\" campaign.

{"title":"2012 Burgas bus bombing","article":"The 2012 Burgas bus bombing was a terrorist attack carried out by a suicide bomber on a passenger bus transporting Israeli tourists at the Burgas Airport in Burgas, Bulgaria, on 18 July 2012. The bus was carrying 42 Israelis, mainly youths, from the airport to their hotels, after arriving on a flight from Tel Aviv. The explosion killed the Bulgarian bus driver and five Israelis and injured 32 Israelis, resulting in international condemnation of the bombing.\n\nIn February 2013, Tsvetan Tsvetanov, the Bulgarian Interior Minister, said there was \"well-grounded\" evidence that Hezbollah was behind the attack. Tsvetanov stated that the two suspects had Canadian and Australian passports and lived in Lebanon. According to the Europol, forensic evidence and intelligence sources all point to Hezbollah's involvement in the blast. Both Iran and Hezbollah have denied any involvement. On 5 June 2013, new Bulgarian Foreign Affairs Minister Kristian Vigenin stated that: \"There is no conclusive evidence for the implication of Hezbollah in the July 2012 bombing in Burgas. The authorities continue to gather evidence.\" However, two weeks later a Bulgarian representative to the European Union revealed that investigators discovered new evidence that implicates Hezbollah operatives were connected to the terrorist attacks. Investigators found that the forged documents used by the perpetrators of the attack were facilitated by a man with ties to Hezbollah. In July 2013, the newly appointed Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetlin Yovchev stated: \"there are clear signs that say Hezbollah is behind the Burgas bombing.\"\n\nOn 25 July 2013, the Bulgarian Interior Ministry released photographs of two Hezbollah operatives suspected in the bombing: Australian citizen Malid Farah (also known as \"Hussein Hussein\"), and Canadian citizen Hassan al-Haj. In 2013, and partly in response to the bombing, the EU unanimously voted to list the military branch of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.\n\nOn 18 July 2014, Bulgaria announced that they identified the bomber as a dual Lebanese-French citizen named Mohamad Hassan El-Husseini.\n\n==Attack==\nSeven people (including the suicide bomber) were killed and at least thirty-two injured in an explosion on an Israeli-operated tour bus at the Burgas Airport in the Black Sea city of Burgas, with a population of some 200,000 people and approximately 400 kilometers (250\u00a0mi) east of the capital, Sofia. In addition, two other buses were damaged in the blast.\n\nBulgarian leaders, including President Rosen Plevneliev, rushed to the site. The Foreign Ministry said authorities believed that the blast was a terrorist attack. According to the initial reports of Bulgarian authorities, the blast was caused by a bomb in a luggage compartment. However, it was later argued by a Bulgarian official that the blast was probably carried out by a male suicide bomber with fake US documents.\n\nAn 11-year-old child and two pregnant women were among the injured, while another pregnant woman was killed. Mustafa Kyosev, the Bulgarian bus driver, was also killed at the age of 36.\n\nSurvivors of the attack described people being thrown into the air, people shouting and crying, and recalled seeing body parts. The witnesses said that the explosion began at the front of the bus and sent fire down through the vehicle. Some passengers on the bus jumped out of windows to escape.\n\nTwo days after the attack, Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said that the bomb was carried in the backpack of a man who was filmed on security cameras at the airport. Tsvetanov added that the bomb was detonated in the luggage compartment of the bus, and that the blast was caused by 3 kilograms of TNT powder.\n\n===Fatalities===\n\n\n==Perpetrator investigations==\nFollowing the attack, a probe was launched to determine who was responsible for the attack. Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said that the investigation might take years. On 12 August, a probe into the attack concluded that the perpetrator was a suicide bomber, which disproved other possible theories, such as being a deluded drug smuggler. On 17 August, Tsvetanov said that the probe indicated that a country or terrorist organization was responsible for the bus bombing, but did not name any suspects.\n\n===Description===\nOn 19 July, Tsvetanov stated that the suspected attacker is seen on security camera tape near the bus for about an hour before the blast and that he had a fake driver's license from the U.S. state of Michigan. The suspected bomber was described as a white male with long hair and wearing glasses.\n\n\n\nBurgas prosecutor Kalina Tchapkanova quoted witnesses who said that the perpetrator \"spoke English with a slight accent\" and appeared to be Arab, while the wife of the owner of a car rental service said she was sure that the perpetrator was of Arab origin, and that he had a shaved head. The Bulgarian prosecutors said that the attacker had short hair, as opposed to the long hair seen in footage captured by a security camera at the airport, while a witness said that the perpetrator appeared to be wearing a wig. Other witnesses said that they saw the perpetrator speaking to tourists at local beaches in the days prior to the attack, and one witness said that the man told a group of tourists that his mother was Dutch and his father was Iranian. According to Dr. Kosyo Yankov, who took part in the autopsy of the bomber, the body parts suggested that the bomber was a heavy man who \"has nothing to do with the slim man caught by the security cameras at the Bourgas airport.\"\n\nOn 24 July, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said that a sophisticated group of conspirators who spent at least a month in Bulgaria before the bombing were responsible for the terrorist attack, confirming suspicions that the perpetrator was not alone. Prime Minister Borisov said that those involved in the bombing used leased vehicles and moved in different cities so they wouldn't be seen together. He added that the perpetrators were \"exceptionally skilled\" and that they operated under \"strict conspiracy rules.\" Prime Minister Borisov said that officials believe he might have flown into Bulgaria from a European country in the Schengen passport-free travel zone, of which Bulgaria is not yet a member, and Bulgaria is exploring that lead with officials in other European countries. Prime Minister Borisov added that DNA samples from the suicide bomber was shared with all partner security services, but no match has been found yet in their databases. European security officials also said that images of the suicide bomber have not yet matched any of their databases, but it's possible the suicide bomber was not on a watch list.\n\nOn 5 February 2013, it was reported that the suspect was a dual Canadian-Lebanese national living in Lebanon.\n\nOn 18 July 2014, Bulgaria announced that they had identified the bomber as 25-year-old Lebanese-French citizen Mohamad Hassan El-Husseini through DNA testing.\n\n===Accomplices===\nOn 16 August, the Bulgarian authorities released a computer-generated image of a suspected accomplice, saying that \"There is data that the man is related to the terrorist attack at the airport.\" The authorities thought it belonged to the suicide bomber, but a facial reconstruction determined that this was not the case, and raised the possibility of an accomplice. The authorities said that the suspected accomplice may have used various aliases while planning the terrorist attack, and used a fake driving license registered to \"Ralph William Rico\" from Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\n\n\nOn 21 August, a man from Plovdiv, a southern Bulgarian, said that he recognized the suspected accomplice, who he said he worked with for five years, and said that the accomplice is a Bulgarian who has been involved with people who preach Islamic extremism. A report in the Bulgarian press reported that the Bulgarian police are investigating this lead as well.\n\nIn late August, on behalf of the Bulgarian government, Interpol attempted to recruit the help of member nations to identify one of the suspects in the investigation, and posted on its website an image of the alleged accomplice, urging anyone who had information about his identity to notify the authorities. The posted images include a copy of the fake driver's license in which the suspect seems to be wearing a wig. Interpol described the suspect as having possible Middle Eastern origin, 1.70\u20131.75 meters tall, and dark brown hair and eyes, who speaks English with an accent.\n\nIn October, Tsvetanov announced that the terrorist responsible for the attack had a maximum of five accomplices, all of which were foreign, and that the terrorist attack was plotted outside of Bulgaria for a year and a half.\n\n===Hezbollah and Iran===\nImmediately following the attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hezbollah of carrying out the attack with the backing of Iran. Netanyahu vowed that Israel would \"react firmly [to this] global Iranian terror onslaught\"; Israeli President Shimon Peres promised retaliation against 'Iranian terrorist sites' around the world. Iran denied responsibility for the act. An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman rejected Netanyahu's accusation that the bombing was carried out by Hezbollah as a proxy for Iran as \"baseless.\"\n\nOn 19 July, The New York Times reported that United States officials identified the suicide bomber as a member of Hezbollah. An unnamed senior official told The New York Times that the bomber had a fake Michigan driver's license, but there are no indications that he had any connection to the United States. He added that the attacker was \"acting under broad guidance\" to hit Israeli targets when opportunities presented themselves and that this guidance was given to Hezbollah from Iran, which uses Hezbollah as a proxy. Two other anonymous officials added that Hezbollah was behind the bombing, although declined to offer further information. One of the officials interviewed declined to describe what specific intelligence led to the belief that the bomber was from Hezbollah.\n\nAlthough Iran has repeatedly denied supporting militant attacks abroad, a report by the New York City Police Department's intelligence analysts said that the suicide bombing in Burgas was the second plot unmasked there this year that is suspected to be perpetrated by Hezbollah and\/or Iran. The report linked nine plots in 2012 in various countries to Iran or its proxies. That same day, Tsvetanov denied media reports that it was a local Hezbollah cell, saying that the possibility was not discussed. He added that the bomber was a foreign national who had been in the country for a minimum of four days, and was not Bulgarian, and also that investigators were following several leads, including that there was an accomplice. However, according to Vladimir Shopov, a political scientist at the New Bulgarian University, \"For small Bulgaria to come out and openly name Hezbollah in such a way is as good as entering a minefield. There would have to be absolute certainty almost.\"\n\nOn 31 July, a member of the Bulgarian security establishment told The New York Times that there was a \"clear direction that points to Hezbollah,\" in the pattern as well as evidence of the attack. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney stated, \"It is certainly the case that Hezbollah and Iran have been bad actors, as a general matter, but we're not, at this point, in a position to make a statement about responsibility.\" The Pentagon has said that there were \"distinctive Hezbollah markings\" linked to the attack in Burgas, although at the time they could not \"decisively state\" who was responsible for the attack.\n\nOn 9 August, The New York Times reported that in the two months leading up to the terrorist attack, Israel's intelligence services intercepted numerous phone calls between Burgas and Lebanon, which increased significantly three days prior to the bombing. An Israeli official said, \"We know the sources in Lebanon, though not the identity of those on the other end in Bulgaria.\" The New York Times also said that American and Bulgarian officials support Israel's assessment of the record, but won't announce that publicly. The newspaper also reported that a German intelligence official said there was skepticism regarding Hezbollah's involvement in the terrorist attack, and it is more likely that operatives with some connection to Hezbollah were used by Iran.\n\nOn 28 August, Lebanese newspaper Al-Jumhuriya reported that Bulgaria is \"leaning toward\" blaming Hezbollah for the terrorist attack. Iran has denied responsibility for the attack.\n\nAfter Bulgaria's centre-right wing government was replaced by a Social Democratic-led one, the certainty about the charges were diminished.\n\n===Base of Jihad===\nOn 21 July, an unknown group called \"Base of Jihad\" claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement that appeared on a Lebanese news site. However, a spokesman for Bulgaria's foreign ministry denied that the group was responsible.\n\n===Mehdi Ghezali===\nA few days after the attack, Bulgarian news sources published information alleging that the bomber was a Swedish citizen and former captive at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Mehdi Ghezali. Swedish and Bulgarian authorities denied that these reports were correct, and United States officials said there was no evidence supporting the reports that Ghezali was responsible.\n\nIn early October 2012, the Bulgarian daily 24 Chasa gained access to an interview with a radical Salafi militant leader, Omar Bakri, who said that he recognized the suspect as being Mehdi Ghezali. After reports surfaced linking Ghezali to the attack, Bakri said that he called \"my brothers in Great Britain\" to determine the identity of the man, who told him that it was Mehdi Ghezali. In addition, Bakri said that his radical organization, Al-Muhajiroun, intended on paying damages to Mustafa Kyosov, the Muslim bus driver who was killed during the attack, but decided against this, because  \"Muslims are warned not to hang around near Jews if they don't want to get hurt.\" Bakri also alleged that Bulgaria and Eastern Europe was considered Islamic territory.\n\n==Reactions==\nThe terrorist attack in Burgas was denounced by governments and supranational organizations worldwide. Bulgaria's EU Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Kristalina Georgieva expressed her shock and sadness; Prime Minister Boyko Borisov called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and conveyed his condolences over the attack; Foreign Minister Nickolay Mladenov condemned the attack but said that it would be a mistake to prematurely jump to conclusions.\n\nThe Bulgarian Parliament unanimously adopted a declaration the day after the attack which condemned the terror attack, and urged the relevant authorities to take all measures in order to catch and bring to justice the perpetrators of the attack. The office of the Chief Mufti, Bulgaria's principal Muslim leader, condemned the terrorist attack and expressed its condolences to the families of the victims.  The office excluded \"the possibility that such people are Muslims.\"\n\nAcross the globe, foreign governments offered support and solidarity to the citizens and authorities of Bulgaria and Israel, and expressed their condolences for the victims. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the attack in \"the strongest possible terms\" and expressed his condolences, and the United Nations Security Council unanimously condemned the attack in Burgas as a terrorist attack and expressed its condolences as well.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter the attack, Sarafovo Airport was closed and flights were redirected to the airport of Varna. Israel's airline El Al canceled its flight from Tel Aviv to Sofia, which was supposed to leave at 16:00 GMT. A military service was held in honor of the victims at Ben Gurion International Airport. Two days after the attack, Israel's Mossad and Shin Bet agencies had teams on the ground in Bulgaria to assist the authorities in identifying the perpetrator. Interpol sent a team of experts to Bulgaria to investigate the terrorist attack. Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble said that the information concerning the fake U.S. ID papers that the perpetrator used could be indispensable and of great value if it is found in Interpol's database.\n\nThe Israeli Air Force sent a C-130 Hercules transport plane to Sarafovo Airport, where it picked up 32 of the wounded and took them to Israel for treatment. A second Israeli C-130 landed in Sofia, carrying Magen David Adom specialists to evaluate the remaining wounded, and to judge whether it was safe to fly them home. The mission included military medical personnel, members of Unit 669, Home Front Command officers, along with a cadre of IDF officers. ZAKA personnel were also sent to Bulgaria to properly identify the bodies. At Ben-Gurion International Airport, 24 ambulances and medical were deployed to ensure that the injured could be swiftly transferred to local hospitals upon arrival.\n\nThe Washington Posts editorial page on 20 July contained an editorial headline \"Holding Iran accountable for terrorist attacks,\" in which The Washington Post said that Iran must suffer for its acts of global terrorism, and \"The Security Council should review the abundant evidence of involvement by the Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah in this year's attacks and punish both those groups as well as the Iranian government with sanctions.\" The newspaper wrote \"Using the territory of countries across the world, working sometimes through proxies like Lebanon's Hezbollah and sometimes with its own forces, Tehran has been intentionally targeting not just diplomats of enemies such as Israel and Saudi Arabia but also civilians.\"\n\nIsraeli security agents feared that an attacker who had survived the Burgas bombing might be part of a threat to Israeli athletes competing at the 2012 Summer Olympics. British officials were dismissive of the additional threat, although the Metropolitan police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe suggested extra anti-terrorist security measures had been taken.\n\nIn August, it was reported that Greek police fear a similar attack on Israeli tourists ahead of Israeli President Shimon Peres' visit to Greece. According to the report, police have raised the alert level and Greek intelligence is in constant contact with the Mossad.\n\n===Bulgarian and Israeli security===\nAround 70 Israelis who escaped the attack were immediately flown home on a Bulgarian plane.\n\nMayor Yordanka Fandakova of Sofia ordered a stronger police presence at all public places linked to the Jewish community, which numbers about 5,000.\n\nThe day after the attack, Israel boosted security at El Al airport counters and around embassies across the globe, whilst flight delays of up to 5\u20136 hours were reported at Ben-Gurion Airport. Mossad and Shin Bet officials convened a meeting on the same day to discuss future coordination and to assess the threat level in various countries throughout the world.\n\nOn 22 July, Mossad Director Tamir Pardo and Shin Bet (Internal Security Agency) Director Yoram Cohen briefed the Israeli Cabinet on the intelligence agencies' actions against terrorism perpetrated by or planned by Iran and Hezbollah around the world according to the intelligence agencies' assessment. Pardo and Cohen said that Iran and Hezbollah have attempted to perpetrate terrorist attacks in over 20 countries in the two years prior to the attack.\n\nIn September 2012, it was reported that Israeli Mossad agents and Bulgarian national security agents (SANS) are working together ahead of the Jewish holiday Rosh Hashana, which falls on Saint Sofia Day in 2012, to enhance security in and around synagogues, hotels, and churches. Intelligence agents will oversee traffic at airports in Sofia and Burgas as well. Although Israel's Counter Terrorism Bureau didn't issue a travel advisory to Bulgaria, it did ask authorities in Bulgaria, Thailand, Greece, and Cyprus to boost security around Israeli tourists ahead of the Jewish High Holidays.\n\n===Humanitarian relief efforts===\nMagen David Adom, Israel's national emergency medical, disaster, ambulance, and blood bank service, sent delegations to Bulgaria to help treat the wounded. The first delegation arrived on the night of the attack. The next morning, two Israeli Air Force C-130 Hercules aircraft landed in Burgas in order to airlift the Israelis injured in Wednesday's terror attack back to Israel.\n\nBulgaria's youngest-ever parliamentarian, Kalina Krumova who is 27 years old, rushed to the hospital in jeans and sandals where the injured were being treated, and stayed there during the entire night alongside the Israeli aid teams. She assisted in translations for the aid teams and in communicating with the injured, since many of the hospital staff did not speak English. Professor Gabi Barbash, head of the Israeli rescue mission, said, \"Without her, we would have been deaf and dumb.\"\n\nIn the afternoon of the day after the attack, a military plane safely returned the 32 Israelis who were wounded to Israel. That night, a C-130 that was sent to Sofia returned to Israel with three Israelis who suffered serious injuries during the attack.\n\n===Bulgaria\u2013Israel relations===\n \nNoah Gal Gendler, a former Israeli ambassador to Bulgaria, said that relations between Israel and Bulgaria are extremely good at present, and the attack won't change this. Gal-Gendler said that the Bulgarian authorities are horrified and in shock.\n\nIn an effort to keep tourism ties strong between Bulgaria and Israel following the terrorist attack, Israeli tourism Minister Stas Misezhnikov traveled to Bulgaria with a delegation of prominent members of Israel's tourism sector and met with Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and President Rosen Plevneliev. At a press conference, Misezhnikov, Borisov, and Plevneliev announced that the two countries would strengthen their strategic cooperation in tourism and security. Misezhnikov also held a memorial ceremony at the site of the bombing. Misezhnikov stressed that \"Terrorism will not disrupt our lives and stop our aspirations,\" and encouraged Israelis to keep traveling, saying that \"tourism is a bridge to peace.\" He also thanked the Bulgarian government for its cooperation and its \"dedicated treatment following the tragic terror attack.\"\n\nOn 25 August, Bulgarian Energy and Economy Minister Delyan Dobrev said that the flow of tourists to Bulgaria from Israel returned to normal, despite the terrorist attack causing a temporary decrease. Dobrev announced that 28 charter flights from Israel had arrived in Bulgaria a week before his announcement, indicating that the flow of tourists had been fully restored. Dobrev also suggested that this restoration was the result of Miszhnikov's visit to Bulgaria, as well as a promotional campaign for Bulgaria by four of Israel's largest print edition and interviews on local TV channels.\n\nIn order to demonstrate unity following the terrorist attack, the Israeli and Bulgarian governments met in Israel at Jerusalem in September 2012. Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, along with 12 out of 16 ministers, visited Israel for a joint meeting between the two governments. In addition, Borissov held one-on-one meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli President Shimon Peres.\n\nIn another meeting in October 2012, Israeli President Shimon Peres praised Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev and Foreign Minister Nikolay Mladenov's response to the terrorist attack, while Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin invited the family of the slain bus driver to Israel.  Peres thanked Bulgaria for saving Jews during the Holocaust and for continuing to support Israel after the terrorist attack.  Plevneliev said that \"together, Israel and Bulgaria will fight terror and evil.\"\n\n==Bulgarian ceremony==\nIn late August 2012, Bulgaria held a remembrance ceremony in honor of the victims of the terrorist attack. Two ceremonies were held, one in Sofia's largest synagogue, which prepared a curation of the ark that contained the names of the victims, and another ceremony was held in Burgas. Israeli groups were accompanied by guards and police canine units, and security was tight. Many families of the victims of the attack took part in the ceremony, and met with Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, and Bulgarian Minister of Tourism Dlyan Dobrev, and were also hosted at the Israeli Ambassador to Bulgaria Shaul Kamisa's house.\n\nAt the ceremony, the Jewish Agency for Israel (JAFI) said that it would include the family of Mustafa Kyosov, the Muslim bus driver who was killed in the attack, among recipients of aid from the Fund for the Victims of Terror. The $1,500 grant was given to the Kyosovs in order to \"ease their financial struggles and show the solidarity of the Jewish people with their loss.\"\n\nIsraeli Strategic Affairs Minister Moshe Ya'alon spoke at the ceremony as well, saying that:\n\nDozens were injured simply because they were Jews and Israelis. Every victim represents an entire world, a life story cut short, dreams that will not be fulfilled. Terrorism does not distinguish between blood and blood, and from person to person. Killers try to reach any place in the world to attack innocent Jews and Israelis, and would not hesitate to kill anyone who stood in their way when they implement their actions.\"\n\nBlood-curdling terrorists do not distinguish between the blood of one person or another. These killers try to attack innocent Jews and Israelis, and they will travel to any part of the world, and kill anyone who stands in their way, in order to do so. [We will] hunt down the perpetrators of this disgusting terror act by any means necessary...and pursue them to the bitter end.\n\n==See also==\n\n* Terrorism in the European Union\n* List of terrorist

{"title":"16 August 2012 Iraq attacks","article":"A series of bombings and shootings occurred in Iraq on 16 August 2012, in one of the most violent attacks since post-US withdrawal insurgency has begun. At least 128 people were killed and more than 400 wounded in coordinated attacks across Iraq, making them the deadliest attacks in the country since October 2009, when 155 were killed in twin bombings near the Justice Ministry in Baghdad.\n\n==Background==\nThe attacks occurred about eight months following the withdrawal of the United States military forces from the area, leaving the security of the country in the hands of the Iraqi security forces. Several major attacks took place in the months of June and July, following a statement released by Islamic State of Iraq to announce the start of a new \"offensive\".\n\n==Attacks==\nNumerous attacks were conducted within hours of each other on 16 August 2012 across Baghdad and several central and northern provinces in Iraq.\n\nAt least 52 people were killed and 177 injured in attacks across Baghdad, with most casualties from two car bombings in the predominantly Shi'ite districts of Zaafaraniya and Sadr City. The deadliest blast happened near an amusement park in Zaafaraniya, claiming 27 lives and injuring 75, most of them women and children. An earlier attack near the park had killed 2 and left 11 injured. Two car bombs exploded next to a government building in the Husseiniya district, killing 7 and injuring 42. In the evening, a car bomb was detonated close to a military checkpoint in Sadr City, killing at least 16 and leaving 49 wounded.\n\nGunmen using silencers shot 10 soldiers dead at a checkpoint in Mushada, northwest of Baghdad, injuring at least 10 others. At least seven explosions and several shootings killed 8 and wounded 29 in Kirkuk, while a suicide car bombing killed 11 officers and injured 31 others at an anti-terrorism office in Daquq. A suicide bombing at a tea shop in Tal Afar killed 7 and injured 25. Attacks in Mosul killed another nine people and injured 27. Ten people were killed and 9 injured in three separate incidents in Diyala Governorate near Baqubah, most of them members of the security forces.

Gunmen killed two civilians at a market in Baaj, and a bomb in Tuz Khurmatu killed a woman and injured 4 others. Bombings also took place in Badush, Abu Ghraib, Al Wajehiya, Hawija, Ramadi and Iskandariya, killing 4 and leaving 24 injured. Unidentified gunmen killed three and injured 5 others in several attacks in Dhouib, al-Rasul and Aswad.\n\n==Perpetrators==\nThough no group has claimed responsibility, the attacks are believed to be orchestrated by al-Qaeda, seeking to regain control of the country following the departure of the American forces.\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n=== Domestic ===\nAn unnamed official for the current Iraqi government believed the attacks were made by al-Qaeda and their allies, as part of a larger scheme to ignite \"a bloody sectarian war\".\n\n== References ==","urls":["http:\/\/democratherald.com\/news\/world\/middle-east\/officials-attacks-kill-in-iraq\/article_91bfc3d3-5be2-5d81-96bb-c152a4805beb.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/08\/17\/world\/middleeast\/at-least-39-killed-in-wave-of-attacks-in-iraq.html","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2012\/08\/16\/world\/meast\/iraq-bloodshed\/index.html","http:\/\/original.antiwar.com\/updates\/2012\/08\/16\/iraq-eid-slaughter-88-killed-238-wounded\/"]}
{"title":"January 2013 Pakistan bombings","article":"On 10 January 2013, several bombings took place in the southwestern Pakistani city of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan, killing a total of 130 people and injuring at least 270. The Quetta bombings led to protests by the city's Shia Muslim Hazara community; Prime Minister of Pakistan Raja Pervez Ashraf responded by dismissing the Chief Minister of Balochistan, Aslam Raisani, and replacing him with Zulfikar Ali Magsi. On the same day, a bomb exploded in Swat District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 22 people and injuring 60 others.\n\n==Background==\n\nSince the government's seizure of Lal Masjid in the national capital of Islamabad, there has been a growing insurgency by the Islamist Pakistani Taliban and others, especially in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, bordering and resultant from Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Additionally, the insurgency in Balochistan, predominantly by the Balochistan Liberation Army, had been ongoing prior to this period; while there has also been deadly sectarianism in Pakistan.\n\n==Bombings==\n===Quetta===\nThree bombs exploded in the city of Quetta, one early in the day and two in the evening. The first bomb, which went off in the city's commercial district near a public plaza and crowded food markets, killed twelve people and injured 47; a Baloch separatist group, the United Baloch Army, claimed responsibility. Police official Hamid Shakil said that \"Frontier Corps personnel were the target because the bomb was planted underneath their vehicle,\" though mostly civilians were killed.\n\nThe deadliest attack came later in the day, when a suicide bomber blew himself up inside a snooker hall at about 8:50 pm, followed about ten minutes later by a car bombing outside the building after police and media personnel had arrived at the scene. 130 people were killed in the two bombings, with at least 270 more injured. At least three more died at hospitals after the bombings, bringing the total death toll to 110. By mid-day on 11 January, the death toll had risen to 112, and by the end of 13 January it had reached 126. In addition to those at the hall at the time of the first bombing, nine policemen, 25 rescue workers and three journalists who had arrived at the scene were killed in the second blast. According to local bomb disposal officials, the suicide bomb had up to  of explosives, while the car bomb had about . The hall was completely destroyed, and surrounding buildings were damaged in the blasts, which also destroyed power lines, causing blackouts in the surrounding area.\n\nLashkar-e-Jhangvi, a Sunni militant group, claimed responsibility for this attack. A government official said that the bombings were likely Lashkar-e-Jhangvi's retaliation for the shooting of a Sunni cleric and the capture of weapons from a site believed to be controlled by the group, both of which had occurred the day before. The Balochistan provincial government said that it would pay two million rupees to the family of each policeman killed, while families of the others killed would receive one million rupees. Three days of mourning were announced for Balochistan in response to the bombings.\n\n====Journalists killed in the attack====\nThe bombing was responsible for the first deaths of journalists in Pakistan in 2013. Pakistan has ranked among the deadliest of countries for journalists over the past several years, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Three journalists were killed and at least two other journalists were seriously injured by the second blast in Quetta. Two were from SAMAA TV: Imran Sheikh had been a camera operator for five years and the third camera operator for the channel who was killed while covering a bombing incident; and Saifur Rehman was a reporter. Also killed in the attack was Iqbal Hussain, who was a journalist from  the news agency News Network International. Rehman died later at a hospital from his injuries, while the other two died on site. At least two other journalists suffered from more than minor injuries, including Jameel Ahmed, the engineer for Samaa TV, and Mohammad Hasan, a photojournalist for Independent News Pakistan.\n\n===Swat Valley===\nAn explosion in a Tableeghi Jamaat seminary in the Swat Valley, outside of Saidu Sharif, killed 22 people, with 60 injured. The explosion was initially reported to be the result of a gas leak in the building's basement, but police and medical officials said it had likely been a bomb\u2014doctors said that victims had been injured by ball bearings, often used in bombs, and according to a senior doctor there was a \"smell of explosives\".\n\n==Reactions==\nProtests in Quetta by the city's Shia community erupted the day after the bombings, with protesters and local Shia officials refusing to bury those killed until the Pakistani army took control of security in the city. Protests also broke out over the weekend of 12\u201313 January in Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, Islamabad and ten other smaller cities around the country.\n\nOn 13 January, Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf visited protesters in Quetta and agreed to dismiss provincial government officials, though he refused to implement military control in the city. Early on 14 January, he announced that Balochistan Chief Minister Aslam Raisani and his cabinet had been removed from their posts, with Zulfikar Ali Magsi appointed to lead the provincial government. In response, Quetta Shias agreed to end their protests and begin burials later in the day.\n\n==See also==\n* February 2013 Quetta bombing\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/www.dailytimes.com.pk\/default.asp?page=2013%5C01%5C11%5Cstory_11-1-2013_pg1_1","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20130222063003\/http:\/\/www.dailytimes.com.pk\/default.asp?page=2013%5C01%5C11%5Cstory_11-1-2013_pg1_1","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2013\/01\/10\/us-pakistan-explosions-idUSBRE90911P20130110","http:\/\/www.presstv.ir\/detail\/2013\/01\/11\/282983\/pakistan-blasts-death-toll-climbs-to-125\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20130115110029\/http:\/\/www.presstv.ir\/detail\/2013\/01\/11\/282983\/pakistan-blasts-death-toll-climbs-to-125\/","http:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/article-83302-Quetta:-Alamdar-Road-blasts-death-toll-rises-to-84","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20130111133615\/http:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/article-83302-Quetta%3A-Alamdar-Road-blasts-death-toll-rises-to-84","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/01\/11\/world\/asia\/pakistan-blast-quetta-swat-valley-elections.html?ref=world","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-asia-20969443","http:\/\/news.xinhuanet.com\/english\/world\/2013-01\/11\/c_132094503.htm","http:\/\/www.samaa.tv\/newsdetail.aspx?ID=59962&CID=1","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20130114220600\/http:\/\/www.samaa.tv\/newsdetail.aspx?ID=59962&CID=1","http:\/\/www.thekooza.com\/quettas-martyred-journalists-laid-to-rest\/","https:\/\/archive.is\/20130216214134\/http:\/\/www.thekooza.com\/quettas-martyred-journalists-laid-to-rest\/","http:\/\/www.cpj.org\/2013\/01\/at-least-two-journalists-killed-in-quetta-blasts.php","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-asia-20989329","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2013\/01\/13\/world\/asia\/pakistan-blasts-bodies\/index.html","http:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/article-83678-President-signs-summary-of-Governors-rule-imposition-in-Balochistan","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2013\/01\/13\/us-pakistan-bombings-idUSBRE90C0DY20130113"]}
{"title":"Peshawar church bombing","article":"On 22 September 2013, a twin suicide bombing took place at All Saints Church in Peshawar, Pakistan, in which 127 people were killed and more than 250 injured. It was the deadliest attack on the Christian minority in the history of Pakistan.\n\n==Bombs== \nThe two suicide bombers shot two security guards, killing one and injuring the other. Stopped by the police, one of the bombers detonated his device. The second bomber entered the church and detonated the bomb inside. Another account tells that the suicide bomb blast occurred when the worshippers assembled for a free meal of rice near the front lawn of the church. There were holes in the walls of the church and the windows of nearby buildings were shattered by the intensity of the blasts. Bodies of the attackers were successfully identified and sent for examination. Their suicide vests were made with  of explosives inside.\n\n==Perpetrators of the attack==\nThe Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan-linked Islamist group Jundallah claimed responsibility for the attack. They said that the attack on Christians and non-Muslims will continue because they are the enemies of Islam and that they will not stop until US drone attacks in Pakistan cease. However, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan denied any involvement in the incident and denied having any links with the perpetrators, saying that their affiliate is Jundul Hafsa, not Jundallah.\n\n==Response of Pakistani Christians==\nChristians residing near the church went to the streets and started protesting by burning tires and shouting slogans. Many shops were shut in the Kohati Gate area, which is home to many other churches. There were protest rallies in Karachi, Lahore, Multan and other cities to condemn the killing. There were also clashes reported in Karachi between angry protestors and police.\n\nChristian communities in Pakistan lamented \"the dying future for Christians in Pakistan\" given this was another in a series of recent attacks. In March, hundreds of Christians were persecuted by Islamic zealots over allegations of blasphemy against Islam, a crime under Pakistani law.\n\n==Reactions==\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the attack and said terrorists have no religion and that targeting innocent people is against the teachings of Islam.\n\n==See also==\n* 28 October 2009 Peshawar bombing\n* Lahore church bombings\n* Qissa Khwani Bazaar bombing\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/zeenews.india.com\/news\/south-asia\/suicide-bombers-attack-historic-church-in-peshawar-60-killed_878368.html","http:\/\/www.ghrd.org\/news\/article\/news\/detail\/News\/the-september-attack-on-all-saints-church-in-peshawar\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20141106162430\/http:\/\/www.ghrd.org\/news\/article\/news\/detail\/News\/the-september-attack-on-all-saints-church-in-peshawar\/","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-asia-24193734","http:\/\/dawn.com\/news\/1044668\/twin-church-blasts-claims-66-lives-in-peshawar","http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/world\/worldnow\/la-fg-wn-suicide-bomber-pakistan-20130922,0,923285.story","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20130922131657\/http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/world\/worldnow\/la-fg-wn-suicide-bomber-pakistan-20130922,0,923285.story","http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1044668\/twin-church-blasts-claim-78-lives-in-peshawar","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/dozens-killed-as-suicide-bombers-attack-christian-worshipers-in-pakistan\/2013\/09\/22\/d2805f6c-237e-11e3-b3e9-d97fb087acd6_story.html","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2013\/09\/22\/us-pakistan-blast-idUSBRE98L02K20130922","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-asia-24193734","http:\/\/www.nation.com.pk\/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online\/national\/23-Sep-2013\/bloodbath-at-peshawar-church","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20130923045334\/http:\/\/www.nation.com.pk\/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online\/national\/23-Sep-2013\/bloodbath-at-peshawar-church","http:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/world\/pakistan\/In-deadliest-attack-on-Pakistani-Christians-Taliban-kill-70-in-historic-Peshawar-church\/articleshow\/22896865.cms","http:\/\/theworldoutline.com\/2013\/09\/pakistan-church-bombing-claims-the-lives-of-85-worshippers\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20141224181115\/http:\/\/theworldoutline.com\/2013\/09\/pakistan-church-bombing-claims-the-lives-of-85-worshippers\/","http:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/article-119674-TTP-says-no-links-with-Jundullah","http:\/\/www.geo.tv\/article-119340-Suicide-bombs-kill-78-outside-Peshawar-Church-injure-over-100","http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/0b4a4ce6-2432-11e3-8905-00144feab7de.html","http:\/\/worldnews.nbcnews.com\/_news\/2013\/09\/22\/20631656-church-bomb-in-pakistan-kills-at-least-55-including-women-and-children?lite"]}

{"title":"2015 Tripoli, Lebanon bombings","article":"On 10 January 2015, nine people were killed and more than 30 wounded when two suicide bombers blew themselves up in a crowded caf\u00e9 in Jabal Mohsen, Tripoli, Lebanon. \n\n==Events==\nAfter the first explosion, the second suicide bomber approached the Abu Imran caf\u00e9. Before he could blow himself up, 60-year-old father of seven \"Abu Ali\" Issa Khaddour rushed and tackled the bomber, and prevented many deaths. The wounded were taken to the hospital in Zgharta, as Jabal Mohsen residents were afraid that Sunni Islamist mobs would kill Alawite wounded if taken to a hospital in Tripoli. The dead were buried on January 12.\n\nThe al-Qaeda affiliated terrorist group Nusra Front took responsibility for the attacks, which targeted members of the Alawite sect. It was the first suicide attack on a civilian neighbourhood in nearly a year, following a security sweep that temporarily calmed the Bab al-Tabbaneh\u2013Jabal Mohsen conflict between Sunnis and Alawites of Tripoli. Nusra claimed the attack was in revenge for the Syrian government's attacks on Sunnis in the Syrian civil war, and for a bombing of Sunni mosques that was blamed on Alawites. The interior minister of Lebanon, Nohad Machnouk, said on January 11 that the attack was carried out by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.\n\n==Reaction==\nThe US strongly condemned the attack. On January 11, the Qalamoun branch of the Nusra Front threatened to conduct more attacks against Jabal Mohsen and Hezbollah. On 10 April 2015, one of the men implicated in the bombings was killed by Lebanese security forces.\n\nA suicide bombing was also supposed to have taken place in another Jabal Mohsen caf\u00e9 simultaneously with the 2015 Beirut bombings on November 12, but the supposed bomber was detained.\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/www.naharnet.com\/stories\/en\/162469-8-people-killed-and-36-injured-in-jabal-mohsen-s-explosion","http:\/\/dailystar.com.lb\/News\/Lebanon-News\/2015\/Jan-12\/283768-father-of-seven-who-died-for-his-neighborhood.ashx","http:\/\/english.al-akhbar.com\/node\/23173","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150115095627\/http:\/\/english.al-akhbar.com\/node\/23173","http:\/\/dailystar.com.lb\/News\/Lebanon-News\/2015\/Jan-12\/283767-jabal-mohsen-bids-farewell-to-fallen-sons.ashx","http:\/\/www.dailystar.com.lb\/News\/Lebanon-News\/2015\/Jan-10\/283682-explosions-heard-in-tripolis-jabal-mohsen-several-wounded-source.ashx","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2015\/01\/11\/us-lebanon-attack-idUSKBN0KK0KS20150111","http:\/\/www.naharnet.com\/stories\/en\/162521-u-s-strongly-condemns-deadly-jabal-mohsen-bombing","http:\/\/www.naharnet.com\/stories\/en\/162593-nusra-to-hizbullah-jabal-mohsen-we-ll-strike-you-in-your-heartlands","http:\/\/www.naharnet.com\/stories\/en\/174908-security-forces-arrest-hoblos-kill-fugitives-in-tripoli","http:\/\/www.naharnet.com\/stories\/en\/194385-report-possible-link-between-tripoli-detainee-and-bourj-barajneh-suicide-bombers"]}

{"title":"2015 Sanaa mosque bombings","article":"The 2015 Sana'a mosque bombings were four suicide attacks on 20 March 2015 in Sana'a, Yemen.\n\n== The attack ==\nThe al-Badr and al-Hashoosh mosques came under suicide attack during midday prayers. The blasts killed 142 people and wounded more than 351, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in Yemen's history. One suicide bomber blew up outside the gate of al-Badr mosque when he was caught by militia guards, and the second detonated his device among fleeing people inside the mosque. Another pair of bombers blew up at Al-Hashoosh mosque.\n\nThe targeted mosques are linked to the Houthis, a group of the Zaidiyyah sect of Shia Islam. The Houthis deposed the Yemeni government earlier in 2015 after they took control of Sana'a the previous year.\n\n== Responsibility ==\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Yemen branch claimed responsibility for the attack. In a recording released by the group, they stated: \"IS soldiers will not rest until they stop the Safawi [Iranian] operation in Yemen.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bruce Riedel of the Brookings Institution, the bombings were more likely carried out by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). AQAP denied this, citing instructions from Ayman al-Zawahiri to not attack mosques or markets. If ISIL was responsible, these would be the first attacks it has carried out in Yemen.\n\n== Reactions ==\nThe U.S. Department of State called for a stop to any military actions, to be followed by a diplomatic solution. Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations Secretary General, demanded that all sides \"immediately cease all hostile actions and exercise maximum restraint.\"\n\nOn 23 March, an Iranian Airbus 310 of Mahan Air loaded with 13-ton package of humanitarian aids as well as aid workers of Iranian Red Crescent landed at Sanaa. On its departure from Yemen, 52 wounded people of the bombings were transferred to Tehran to receive treatment.

{"title":"Lahore church bombings","article":"On 15 March 2015, two explosions took place at Roman Catholic Church and Christ Church during Sunday service in Youhanabad, Lahore, Pakistan. At least 15 people were killed and seventy were wounded in the attacks.\n\nThe attack was followed by mob violence killing two men mistaken as militants. It was the second attack on Christians minority after the deadliest attack in 2013 on All Saints church in Peshawar. In August 2015, Punjab home minister Shuja Khanzada announced that five members of the Tehreek-e-Taliban were arrested in connection to the attack. According to the statement, the men received monetary and material support from India and planned the attack in Afghanistan, from where they came to Lahore. The arrested men also confessed to planning further attacks in Karachi and Lahore.\n\n==Background==\nThe Pakistani Taliban operates as an umbrella organization for various Islamist militant groups in Pakistan. They actively target religious minorities for attacks, including a series of attacks in 2002.\nIn August 2002, three nurses died in a grenade attack on a chapel located on the grounds of the Taxila Christian Hospital, in September 2002 seven charity workers were killed in Karachi and on 25 December 2002 a grenade attack on a Presbyterian church killed three girls. The September 2013 suicide attack on the historic All Saints Church in Peshawar killed 75 people.\n\nOne of the Islamist militant groups allied to the Pakistani Taliban is Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, a breakaway organisation that reunited in March 2015. Jamaat-ul-Ahrar carried out the November 2014 Wagah border attack where over 60 people died and over 100 were injured, and the same month killed at least six people in Mohmand Agency and attacked the membership camp of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement party in Karachi.\n\nJamaat-ul-Ahrar operate the Afia Siddiqui Brigade, named after Aafia Siddiqui, which previously carried out 2012 attacks on a police van on the Peshawar Ring Road and on the Judicial Complex in Peshawar.\n\n==Attack==\nAccording to reports, two suicide bombers attacked the churches located in a Christian locality. The bombings took place during weekly Christian service at the two churches of Yuhanabad neighbourhood located at a distance of half a kilometre apart.\n\nThe bombers targeted two churches, Saint John Catholic Church and Christ Church at around 11:00\u00a0am local time. Both churches are located in the Youhanabad area, which is one of the country's biggest Christian localities and is home to least one million people.\n\nThe bombers tried to enter the churches but were stopped at the gate by the guards, where they blew themselves up. The high number of casualties was due to the fact that weekly service was underway when the attacks occurred. The wounded were rushed to the General Hospital, where a state of emergency was declared at 12:21\u00a0pm.\nThe explosions caused a stampede at the Church as worshipers ran to save their lives. Windowpanes were broken due to the explosions.\n\n==Responsibility==\nJamaat-ul-Ahrar a splinter group of Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, which had reconciled with and rejoined the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan earlier the same month claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\nTehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan spokesperson Ehsanullah Ehsan used his Afghan mobile number to contact the media in Pakistan. He said, \"We have carried out the attack. We have reached Lahore, the center of Punjab province, which is a challenge and a warning to the rulers,\". He said that the group of suicide bombers who carried out the attack belonged to the Aafia Siddiqui Brigade. In August 2015, Punjab home minister Shuja Khanzada announced that five people were arrested in connection with the attack. According to Khanzada, they belonged to the TTP's Shehryar Mehsud group and planned the attacks inside Afghanistan, from where they came to Lahore. According to the statement, the arrested suspects received monetary and material support from India. They also confessed to planning more attacks in Karachi and Lahore.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe attacks ignited protests which continued for the next three days. During the most violent of these protests two men were lynched on the same day as the attacks. The next day paramilitary personnel had to be deployed in order to maintain law and order. The victims were laid to rest on 17 March amid tight security and several thousand police and rangers personnel were deployed in Lahore during the last rites.\n\nPoliticians, religious leaders and members of the civil society condemned the attacks, while calling for stricter security measures. However, the lynching by the mob was also condemned and Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan termed it as \"the worst kind of terrorism\".\n\nThe second leg of the FIFA World Cup qualifier match between Pakistan and Yemen was to be played in Lahore but FIFA first gave the go-ahead for the match saying that it could be played behind closed doors but later a statement issued by the governing body cited \"safety and security reasons\" for the postponement of the match and said that the Asian Zone first round second leg tie will be played in a neutral venue. A subsequent statement by FIFA said that the match will played in Manama, Bahrain.\n\n===Protests===\nAfter the attack up to 4,000 Christians gathered at the attack site, formed a mob and blocked Ferozepur road. The angry mob attacked a nearby Metro bus station. Water cannons were dispatched to help police clear the area. However, the mob took three policemen hostage and refused to talk with Ports and Shipping Minister Kamran Michael, who had arrived to console them. The mob captured and lynched two men suspected of being involved in the attacks.\nChristian community in Faisalabad city also protested against the attacks. Members of the Christian community in Karachi took to the streets and protested at Esa Nagri area against the bomb attacks. They blocked the route from Hassan Square to Liaquatabad area of the city. Similar protests were staged in Multan, Gujranwala, Sialkot and other cities of Pakistan.\n\nThe next day up to 5,000 Christians gathered to protest but protests again turned violent as two people were killed and at least six were injured when a van ran over the protesters.\n\n===Lynching===\nThe angry mob lynched two persons. One of the lynched men was identified as Muhammad Naeem by his brother Muhammad Saleem who filed an FIR of a murder case against the protesters. He claimed that his brother was innocent, he further stated that his brother was not a militant. He was missing and when they went to hospital they came to know that he was one of those lynched. He said his brother was a glasscutter and they owned a glass shop and his brother had gone there for their work.\n\nThe second victim was identified as Babar Noman, a garment worker who had come from Sargodha in search of employment at a factory. The police buried the victims body on 17 March but a court ordered the exhumation of the body once the victims family lodged a complaint. However, the authorities have stated that the body will not be handed over before a DNA test is used to prove his identity.\n\n==Reaction==\n===Domestic reaction===\n====Government====\nA spokesman for the Punjab province government condemned the attacks and said authorities are reinforcing security at the 481 remaining churches across the city. The Chief Minister of Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif condemned the attacks and commented that killing someone on the basis of suspicion is inhumane. No one has the right to take the law into their hands.\n\nThe Balochistan Provincial assembly condemned the suicide attacks and lynching of two men by an angry Christian mob.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif also condemned the attack. Interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan condemned terrorist attacks on churches and said those who had done this did not belong to any religion because no religion tolerates such odious crimes. He also said that action would be taken against those who burnt two people alive and damaged public and private properties.\n\n====Religious groups====\nThe Catholic Church of Pakistan strongly condemned the suicide bombings and urged all Pakistanis to stand with their fellow Christians against extremists. Pakistan Catholic Bishops' Conference urged the nation's provincial and federal governments to take effective measures to provide security to the churches of Pakistan, so as to guarantee freedom of religion and worship. The church also appealed to the Christian community to avoid violence and co-operate with the police in their investigations. The Catholic bishops said that they prayed to their Lord for the health of the injured and to grant grace to the families who lost their loved ones.\n\nMuslim scholars hailing from different schools of thought condemned the attack and termed it un-Islamic. Muftis of Sunni Ittehad Council said that Islam did not permit attacks on the worship places of religious minorities. A Muslim state was responsible for the protection of minorities. They also urged Islamic scholars to define the rights of minorities in Islam.\nPakistan Ulema Council leader Tahir Ashrafi said, 'It seems like a conspiracy to ignite communal violence in the country. I appeal to all Pakistanis to stand united against this act of terrorism'.\nJamaat Ahle Hadith Pakistan and Milli Majlis Shari also condemned the attack and urged the religious scholars to play their role against terrorism.\n\n===International reaction===\n*  Vatican \u2013 Pope Francis said, 'It's with pain, much pain that I was told of the terrorist attacks against two Christian churches in Lahore in Pakistan, which have caused numerous deaths and injuries. These are Christian churches and Christians are persecuted, our Christian brothers are spilling their blood simply because they are Christians. I implore God...that this persecution against Christians\u2014that the world seeks to hide\u2014comes to an end and that there is peace.'\n*  \u2013 Jen Psaki said, 'We strongly condemn Sunday's attack on innocent people at two churches in Lahore, and we extend our deepest sympathies and condolences to the families of the victims. The United States stands in solidarity with the people and government of Pakistan. We support the right of every person to practise religion without fear of intimidation, death, coercion or any form of reprisal. This is a basic human right both in Pakistan and throughout the world.'\n*  - UN Deputy Spokesman Farhan Haq read out a statement of the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon wherein he said \"The secretary general notes with grave concern that the Pakistani Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attacks while threatening to carry out more such acts in the future,He (the UN chief) calls on the Government of Pakistan to swiftly bring the perpetrators to justice and to do its utmost to prevent attacks against places of worship and protect religious minorities. The secretary-general extends his heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and to the government and people of Pakistan.\"\n*  - The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement \"We strongly condemn this atrocious attack that targets the stability and peace of Pakistan, and we wish God's mercy on those who lost their lives, convey our sympathies to their families and wish for speedy recovery of the wounded\".\n*  - The Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry issued a statement condemning the attacks and said \"The dastardly act against a religious congregation engaged in the practice and sustenance of their faith and spiritual upliftment is not only an attack against a group and places of worship but against humanity and the civilized world. Sri Lanka as a country which has suffered from the scourge of terrorism for more than 30 years shares the grief and pain of the people of Pakistan at this moment of distress.\"\n*  - The Chinese Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks and their spokesman Hong Lei said \"We are deeply shocked and in a state of grief over the attack and condemn the terrorists in the strongest terms. China extends heartfelt condolences to the victims and expresses deep sympathy to the wounded and the families of the victims.\"\n\n==See also==\n*Terrorist incidents in Pakistan in

{"title":"Suru\u00e7 bombing","article":"The Suru\u00e7 bombing took place in the Suru\u00e7 district of \u015eanl\u0131urfa Province in Turkey at approximately 12:00 local time on 20 July 2015, outside the Amara Culture Centre. 33 people were killed and 104 were reported injured. Most victims were members of the Socialist Party of the Oppressed (ESP) Youth Wing and the Socialist Youth Associations Federation (SGDF), university students who were giving a press statement on their planned trip to reconstruct the Syrian border town of Koban\u00ee.\n\nKoban\u00ee, which is approximately 10\u00a0km from Suru\u00e7, was until January under siege by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) forces. More than 300 members of the SGDF had travelled from \u0130stanbul to Suru\u00e7 to participate in three to four days of rebuilding work in Koban\u00ee, and had been staying at Amara Cultural Centre while preparing to cross the border. The explosion, which was caught on camera, was identified as being caused by a suicide attack.\n\nThe next day, ISIL (the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) claimed responsibility for the attack. ISIL had allegedly made the decision to pursue more active operations in Turkey just days before the attack. The attacker, \u015eeyh Abdurrahman Alag\u00f6z (20), an ethnic Kurd from Ad\u0131yaman, reportedly had links to Islamic State militants.\n\nThis was possibly the first planned attack by ISIL on Turkish soil, although previous incidents such as the 2013 Reyhanl\u0131 bombings, the 2015 Istanbul suicide bombing, and the 2015 Diyarbak\u0131r rally bombings have also been blamed by some on ISIL. The bombing resulted in a new escalation between Turkey and ISIL, with Turkish soldiers and ISIL militants directly engaging in the border town of Kilis on 24 July 2015. This led to Turkey launching Operation Martyr Yal\u00e7\u0131n, a series of airstrikes against mostly Kurdish militant positions in Northern Iraq and Syria. Large-scale operations against PKK, but including some ISIL targets, began on 24 July; however, most arrests were of PKK members.\nThe bombing was met with international condemnation by a variety of organizations, as well as promises by the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) to tighten the Turkish-Syrian border following the attack. The opposition criticised the government for not securing the border beforehand, while the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) also came under scrutiny for endorsing the crossing of the victims past the border despite significant threats from ISIL.\n\n==Background==\nThe district of Suru\u00e7 is located on the Syrian-Turkish border in the Province of \u015eanl\u0131urfa, approximately  from the Syrian town of Koban\u00ee. The populations of both Suru\u00e7 and Koban\u00ee are mostly Kurds, with the cultural ties between the two having resulted in deadly riots in south-eastern Turkey in October 2014 when Koban\u00ee was under siege by Islamic State militants. The riots had mainly protested the Turkish government's lack of intervention in Koban\u00ee against ISIL. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan claimed he was not prepared to launch operations against ISIL unless it was also against the forces of Bashar Al Assad. Furthermore, allegations of covert funding and the arming of ISIL by the Turkish government, which came under particular scrutiny following the 2014 M\u0130T lorries scandal, also caused heavy controversy.\n\n===The Siege of Koban\u00ee (2014\u201315)===\n\nKoban\u00ee was retaken from ISIL forces in late January 2015, with the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) taking full control of the city. ISIL vowed to return, committing a series of massacres in the city in June 2015. The Socialist Youth Associations Federation (SGDF) of Turkey requested permission to cross the border and participate in the reconstruction of the war-torn city.\n\n===Turkish invasion threats===\n\nDuring late June and early July 2015, the Turkish and Jordanian governments made threats to invade Syria and set up buffer zones. Turkey also agreed to let the United States of America use Turkish bases for drone strikes against ISIL.\n\n==Explosion==\n===Perceived targets===\nThe bombing appeared to target members of the Socialist Youth Associations Federation (SGDF), the Youth Wing of the Socialist Party of the Oppressed (ESP), of which 300 members had travelled to Suru\u00e7 from \u0130stanbul in order to cross the border into Koban\u00ee to take part in reconstruction projects there. The members were staying at the Amara Culture Centre and were giving a press statement on the reconstruction of Koban\u00ee when the bombings took place. Shortly after the bombing in Suru\u00e7, there was an explosion at an old mortar warehouse in Koban\u00ee itself.\n\n===Bombing===\nA survivor present at the press statement when the bombing took place, theatre actor Murat Akda\u011f, said that the bomb exploded in the middle of the group listening to the statement being made. Wounds on casualties taken to hospital showed evidence of burns and cluster bomb fragments. A spokesperson for the municipality of Suru\u00e7 added that there was the potential for a second bombing, asking individuals close to the Amara Cultural Centre to evacuate the area. Initial reports identified an 18-year-old female suicide bomber as the perpetrator, although the government later formally identified a male disguised as a woman as the detonator of the bomb. The Turkish government began investigating domestic and international affiliations of the suspect shortly after identification.\n\n==Perpetrators==\nOn 21 July, website Euronews reported that ISIL had claimed the attack.\n\nOn 22 July, some Turkish media reports indicated the suspected perpetrator, \u015eeyh Abdurrahman Alag\u00f6z, whose ID card was found at the scene, was a 20-year-old Turkish Kurd from Ad\u0131yaman who had been recruited by ISIL six months earlier.\n\nThe pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) however named a 20-year-old woman, whom the police had recently released from custody, as perpetrator.\n\nAnother media report pointed at Dokumac\u0131lar, an ISIL-linked terrorist group.\n\n==Reactions==\n===Domestic reactions===\n\nThe Prime Minister of Turkey, Ahmet Davuto\u011flu, formed a crisis meeting and sent Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmu\u015f, Interior Minister Sebahattin \u00d6zt\u00fcrk and Minister of Labour and Social Security Faruk \u00c7elik to Suru\u00e7 to follow developments. Deputy Prime Minister Yal\u00e7\u0131n Akdo\u011fan condemned the bombing, stating on social media that Turkey would never yield to such terrorist attacks.\n\nThe President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, was in Northern Cyprus at the time of the bombing. In a statement, he condemned the attack and offered condolences to the relatives of the victims. He further claimed that government ministers would continue their investigations. Former President Abdullah G\u00fcl also condemned the attack and offered condolences.\n\nThe Governor of \u015eanl\u0131urfa, \u0130zzettin K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck, confirmed that the explosion was a result of a suicide bombing, but caused controversy when it emerged that he had previously claimed that there was no threat from ISIL to \u015eanl\u0131urfa before the bombing.\n\nThe Ministry of the Interior warned soon after the bombing occurred that casualties were likely to rise, adding that the perpetrators would be caught and brought to justice as soon as possible.\n\nThe Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) chairman Selahattin Demirta\u015f claimed that the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) were responsible for the attack, claiming the bombing could not have taken place without assistance from the state. The HDP's parliamentary group leader Pervin Buldan released a statement claiming that the HDP would treat the attacks as a suicide bombing perpetrated by ISIL until more reliable information is made available. HDP Member of Parliament Dengir Mir Mehmet F\u0131rat claimed that the target of the attack was the Turkish Republic itself. HDP Adana Member of Parliament Meral Dan\u0131\u015f Be\u015fta\u015f called the attack a 'massacre' and said the HDP Central Executive Committee would meet to discuss the bombing.\n\nThe main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) also sent a delegation to Suru\u00e7 formed of ten MPs led by CHP Deputy Leader Sezgin Tanr\u0131kulu. Another CHP Deputy Leader, G\u00fcrsel Tekin, stated that his party had consistently warned the government that the border between Syria and Turkey had been left undefended, while Tanr\u0131kulu criticised the AKP for being responsible for Turkey's situation.\n\nThe Kurdish con-federalist Group of Communities in Kurdistan (KCK) held the AKP responsible, accusing the AKP of funding ISIL, thus contributing to its terrorist attacks and efforts. The PKK blamed the Turkish government for the attack, saying the government is conspiring with ISIL.\nThis anger of the PKK contributed to PKK revenge attacks (see section Aftermath).\n\n===International reactions===\n*  - Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan released a statement condemning the attack and offering condolences to the families of the dead.\n*  - The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemned and extended deepest sympathy to the families of the victims. Ministry believes that perpetrators will be brought to justice.\n*  - The European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighborhood Policy Johannes Hahn using his Twitter account expressed condolences to people of Suru\u00e7 noting that again Syrian crisis influenced tragically neighboring countries.\n*  - The German Minister for Foreign Affairs, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, stated that Turkey was an important partner in fighting terror and offered sympathies with the injured and relatives of the dead. He stated that the fact that the attack targeted young people was particularly horrific.\n*  - The Youth Wing of the governing SYRIZA party of Greece released a statement stating that they would continue the work of their 32 fallen comrades.\n*  - The President of Northern Cyprus, Mustafa Ak\u0131nc\u0131, issued a joint press statement alongside Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who was visiting Northern Cyprus when the attack occurred. In his statement, Ak\u0131nc\u0131 said terrorism should always be condemned, regardless of its origin or methods.\n*  - The Pakistan embassy in Ankara released a statement reiterating Pakistan's unconditional condemnation for all attacks of terrorism and offered their condolences to the Turkish government and the Turkish people.\n*  - Terrorist attack condemned by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev expressed his condolences to relatives of the victims. Russian Federal Agency for Tourism urged Russian citizens vacationing in Turkey to remain in protected tourist areas and not to leave them for their own safety.\n*  - Togolese President Komi S\u00e9lom Klassou. expressed his sadness at the event. Togolese citizens living in Turkey were advised to flee the area.\n*  - The British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Philip Hammond, issued a statement on Twitter condemning the bombing and offering his sympathies for the injured and families of those killed.\n*  - The US embassy in Ankara released a statement condemning the attack and offering condolences to the families of the dead.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n\n=== Demonstrations ===\nDemonstrations were held in several provinces of Turkey to protest the attack. During a protest attended by approximately 1,000 people in Mersin two protestors were shot and lightly wounded by an unknown perpetrator with a hunting rifle.\n\n=== Ceylanp\u0131nar's double assassination ===\n\nTwo days after the bombing in Suru\u00e7 two police officers were found dead in the same building in the district of Ceylanp\u0131nar, which is also in \u015eanl\u0131urfa Province. At least one of the officers was identified as working for an anti-terrorism task force. The PKK claimed responsibility for the attack, as a revenge act for the events in Suru\u00e7. Following a statement from the \u015eanl\u0131urfa Governor \u0130zzettin K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck, a ban on press coverage came into effect and Twitter was blocked while sensitive content was removed from the site. 9 people were anonymously denounced and accused of the assassinations. As of April 16, 2019, the 9 accuses acquittal is uphelp by the Higher Court of Turkey. The assassinations is now commented as the casus belli used to drop the 2013-2015 Solution process, revive nationalist fervor and undo the June 2015 Turkey elections via the November 2015 Turkey elections.\n\n=== Anti-PKK offensives ===\nIn raids across the country, nearly 600 terror suspects were arrested including alleged members of ISIS. However the majority of those arrested were members of non-Islamist groups such as the PKK, Revolutionary People's Liberation Party\u2013Front and other left-wing groups.\n\nOn the following Friday, 24 July, Turkey for the first time carried out airstrikes against ISIS positions in Syria near the Turkish border, without entering Syrian airspace. However, the same day Turkey also began airstrikes against PKK camps in northern Iraq, despite the fact the PKK is fighting against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.\n\nOn the Saturday following the airstrikes the president of Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government, Masoud Barzani, called Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu. He urged Turkey to halt its airstrikes against the PKK over their territory and resolve their problem through negotiations.\n\n==See also==\n\n* List of terrorist incidents in 2015\n* 2015

{"title":"May 2016 Yemen police bombings","article":"On 15 May 2016, a suicide bombing in the southern Yemeni port city of Mukalla, the capital of the Hadhramaut province, killed at least 47 police and injured over 60. The bombing was preceded by an attack, where 15 Yemeni troops were killed in attacks on army positions outside Mukalla. ISIL said, one of its militants blew up a vehicle, packed with explosives, in an army base in the Khalf district at the city's eastern outskirts.\n\n==Background==\nThe U.S. military announced, a week before the attacks, it had deployed a small number of personnel to Yemen, to aid the fight against AQAP, its first troop presence in the country since the Houthi takeover. A year of al-Qaeda rule also ended a month before the attacks. ISIL rarely intervenes in the area, the bombings took place, as it is known to be a stronghold of its al-Qaeda rivals. One day before, troops guarding an army post, in the Khalf district of Mukalla, opened fire at a vehicle, after they suspected its driver of being a suicide bomber, a security official said, adding, that the vehicle sped away. A general boasted, that his forces had captured around 250 al-Qaeda members, since they retook Mukalla and nearby coastal towns, including its commander for the city of Shihr. Iran and Saudi Arabia have also gotten involved in the conflict. ISIL had claimed responsibility for several attacks on government and coalition targets in Aden in the recent months.\n\n==Bombing==\nThe first bomber, Abu al-Bara al-Ansari, detonated an explosives belt, as he joined a line of men at a police recruiting centre. The bomb exploded as Hadhramaut's security chief, general Mubarak al-Oubthani, walked out of his office, killing six of his guards, but leaving him with only minor injuries. The attacks included a suicide bombing, that targeted the residence of the commander of Hadhramaut's second military region, general Faraj Salmeen, but he escaped unharmed. The suicide bomber killed at least 41 police recruits and 47 police in total. The bomber also injured over 60 people.\n\n==See also==\n*List of terrorist incidents, January\u2013June 2016\n*Yemeni civil war (2015\u2013present)\n*Missionaries of Charity attack in Aden\n*2016 Aden car bombing\n*23 May 2016 Yemen bombings\n*June 2016 Mukalla attacks\n*August 2016 Aden bombing\n\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/2016\/05\/15\/at-least-37-police-killed-in-bomb-attacks-on-yemen-port-city-rec\/","https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/25-yemen-police-recruits-killed-suicide-bombing-claimed-090355780.html","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-yemen-security-blast-idUSKCN0Y607F"]}

The initial attack killed 64 people and wounded 347. It was their biggest attack on an urban area since 2001.\n\n==Bombings==\nLocal broadcaster TOLOnews reported that the attack involved a suicide bomber detonating a vehicle laden with \"hundreds of kilograms of explosives\" and the militants then making their way into the compound of \"Department 10\" of the National Directorate of Security (NDS) and opening fire. The bomb that detonated caused a ceiling to collapse in a classroom where elite intelligence officers were being trained. An Afghan security official said members of that unit accounted for about half of the people killed. The local broadcast station said that a two-hour gun battle ensued between the militants and security forces.\n\n== Developments ==\nSediq Sediqi, a spokesman for the Afghani Interior Ministry, said that despite the target, most of the victims were civilians. Ismail Kawasi, spokesman for the Public Health Ministry, said that 327 wounded have been brought to area hospitals. On 20 April 2016, Sediqi confirmed in a tweet that 64 \"innocent Afghans\" were killed and 347 wounded.\n\nAfghan Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack. He said as many as 92 security staff and soldiers were killed. It came after the group announced its annual spring offensive Operation Omari.\n\n==Reactions==\n\n=== Domestic ===\nPresident Ashraf Ghani issued a statement saying that the attack proved that the Taliban were growing weak and therefore resorting to asymmetric warfare. Shortly after the attack, women's rights activist Wazhma Frogh wrote on Twitter that the attacks took place near schools and that parents were attempting to protect their children.\n\nSome parliamentarians strongly condemned President Ashraf Ghani for failing to provide security from the terrorist attacks.\n\n=== International ===\n\n==== Supranational unions ====\n* : General John W.

{"title":"March 2016 Istanbul bombing","article":"On 19 March 2016, a suicide bombing took place in Istanbul's Beyo\u011flu district in front of the district governor's office. The attack occurred at 10:55 (EET) at the intersection of Balo Street with \u0130stiklal Avenue, a central shopping street. The attack caused at least five deaths, including that of the perpetrator. Thirty-six people were injured, including seven whose injuries were severe. Among those injured were twelve foreign tourists. Among those killed, two were of dual Israel-US nationality. On 22 March, the Turkish interior minister said that the bomber had links with ISIL.\n\n== Background ==\nThe bombing was the fourth suicide bombing in Turkey in 2016, and occurred six days after a bombing in Ankara that left 37 people dead. The United States embassy in Ankara had issued a terrorism warning to its citizens the day before the bombing for Istanbul, Ankara, \u0130zmir and Adana. The German embassy had also issued a security warning to its citizens three days before the bombing. Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu had called the warnings \"normal\". Germany had also closed its consulate on the avenue on Thursday and Friday as a security measure.\n\nAccording to BBC, residents of Istanbul had already been vigilant before the attack due to the recent explosion in Ankara and were wary of going out. Following the bombing, according to Cumhuriyet, the Turkish government received heavy criticism on social media for defects in its security.\n\n== Attack ==\n\nThe bombing took place on \u0130stiklal Avenue, a shopping area popular with tourists and considered the busiest avenue in Turkey. However, the bombing took place at a time when the avenue was relatively quiet. The site of detonation was a few hundred metres away from a place where police buses are usually parked. According to an eyewitness, the bomber detonated the bomb whilst passing by a group of tourists. Hundreds of people reportedly ran away from the site of attack in panic after the explosion. Nails and small pieces of metal were reportedly scattered in the area due to the attack. Following the bombing, the avenue was closed off to the public. According to a CNN T\u00fcrk reporter on the scene, the suicide attacker was on his way to the actual target when the bomb went off in front of a restaurant. Another account from a Turkish official (cited by Reuters) states the bomber was \"deterred\" from his or her actual target by the police and set off the bomb \"out of fear\". Initial findings pointed to Kurdish perpetrators.\n\n=== Victims ===\nAccording to H\u00fcrriyet, two of the victims killed were American Israeli and one of the victim killed was Israeli and one was Iranian. One of the victims that died in the explosion was a child. Two of the tourists injured were also children.\n\n\nIsraeli authorities identified the three Israeli victims as Yonatan Suher (40 years old) from Tel Aviv, Simcha Dimri (60) from Dimona, and Avraham Goldman (69) from Ramat Hasharon.\n\nThe Iranian fatalities were identified as Ali Razm khah (Dead) & Zhila Shariat, Azam Razmkhah and A 1-year-old, Diana Razmkhah, were injured.\n\nThe Ba\u015faran family from Adana was among those injured in the blast. The family of four had come to Istanbul as tourists and were shopping and sightseeing in the Istiklal Avenue when the blast occurred. 2.5-year-old Asya Ba\u015faran was hit by a metal fragment in the head, whilst her mother, \u00c7ilem Ba\u015faran, was hit in the shoulder and the groin. They were both life-threateningly injured.\n\n=== Perpetrator ===\nWhile the authorities were quick to blame the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) given the Ankara bombing in February, only upon further investigation in the afternoon, the Turkish authorities changed their initial assessment, now instead holding the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) accountable. According to Milliyet, Turkish authorities never ruled out ISIL as suspects early on. According to the newspaper, the fact that the attack occurred near a group of tourists indeed suggested an ISIL involvement. PKK umbrella organization KCK said it opposed targeting civilians and condemned attacks on them.\n\nThe next day, Turkish authorities announced that Mehmet \u00d6zt\u00fcrk was reliably identified by DNA tests to be the suicide bomber of the Istanbul attack. Born 1992 in Gaziantep Province and thought to be affiliated with ISIL, he was one of two Turkish suspects the authorities were investigating. The day before, Sabah had named \u00d6zturk and 33-year-old ISIL militant Sava\u015f Y\u0131ld\u0131z from Adana, who is also thought to be involved in the October 2015 Ankara bombings killing more than 100 civilians. In the night, authorities arrested Y\u0131ld\u0131z' parents, but they were released later. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk had reportedly left his house in Gaziantep in 2013, and he was linked to ISIL by authorities after he was reported missing. He had reportedly visited his family one month before the attack. On 18 March, he bought a bus ticket to Istanbul from Ad\u0131yaman and arrived in Istanbul on the day of the attack in a bus he took from Ad\u0131yaman.\n\n== See also ==\n* January 2016 Istanbul bombing\n* February 2016 Ankara bombing\n* March 2016 Ankara bombing\n* List of Islamist terrorist attacks\n* List of terrorist incidents, January\u2013June 2016\n\n== References ==","urls":["https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2016\/03\/20\/world\/europe\/ap-eu-turkey-explosion.html","http:\/\/aa.com.tr\/en\/turkey\/istanbul-bomber-identified-\/540606","http:\/\/www.hurriyet.com.tr\/son-dakika-istanbul-istiklal-caddesinde-patlama-meydana-geldi-40071967","http:\/\/t24.com.tr\/haber\/istiklal-caddesinde-patlama-yaralilar-var,332710","https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/europe\/istanbul-explosion-injuries-reported-as-tourist-shopping-area-hit-by-blast-in-turkish-city-a6940706.html","http:\/\/www.jpost.com\/Israel-News\/Israeli-authorities-publicize-name-of-fatality-from-Istanbul-attack-448493","http:\/\/www.hurriyetdailynews.com\/Default.aspx?pageID=238&nID=96674&NewsCatID=509","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-turkey-blast-idUSKCN0WL0D5","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-europe-35850625","http:\/\/www.cumhuriyet.com.tr\/haber\/turkiye\/500728\/Herkes_patlama_olacagini_biliyordu__onlenemedi.html","http:\/\/www.cumhuriyet.com.tr\/haber\/turkiye\/500714\/istiklal_Caddesi_nde_canli_bomba_saldirisi__5_olu__7_si_agir_36_yarali.html","http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2016\/03\/istanbul-taksim-square-area-hit-explosion-160319091702737.html","http:\/\/www.hurriyetdailynews.com\/five-killed-at-least-20-injured-in-suicide-attack-in-central-istanbul.aspx?pageID=238&nID=96661&NewsCatID=341","http:\/\/uk.reuters.com\/article\/uk-turkey-blast-istanbul-pkk-idUKKCN0WL0GR","http:\/\/www.posta.com.tr\/turkiye\/HaberDetay\/Taksim-de-canli-bomba-saldirisi-.htm?ArticleID=333017","http:\/\/sendika10.org\/2016\/03\/istiklal-caddesinde-patlama-yaralilar-var\/","https:\/\/archive.today\/20160319180846\/http:\/\/sendika10.org\/2016\/03\/istiklal-caddesinde-patlama-yaralilar-var\/","http:\/\/www.jpost.com\/Israel-News\/Five-Israelis-wounded-in-Istanbul-suicide-bombing-evacuated-from-Turkey-448532","http:\/\/sendika44.org\/2016\/03\/istiklal-caddesinde-bombali-saldiri-en-az-5-olu-7si-agir-36-yarali\/<\/ref>","http:\/\/www.asriran.com\/fa\/news\/458111\/%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B2%D8%AE%D9%85%DB%8C-%D9%88-%DA%A9%D8%B4%D8%AA%D9%87-%D8%B4%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%81%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%84","http:\/\/www.entekhab.ir\/fa\/news\/259194\/%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B2%D8%AE%D9%85%DB%8C-%D9%88-%DA%A9%D8%B4%D8%AA%D9%87-%D8%B4%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%81%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%84","http:\/\/www.milliyet.com.tr\/dualar-minik-asya-icin-gundem-2213140\/","http:\/\/www.ynetnews.com\/articles\/0,7340,L-4780607,00.html","http:\/\/www.milliyet.com.tr\/istiklal-caddesi-nde-patlama-gundem-2212382\/","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-turkey-blast-idUSKCN0WL0D5","http:\/\/www.sabah.com.tr\/gundem\/2016\/03\/19\/canli-bomba-suphelileri-icin-dna-ornegi-alindi","http:\/\/www.cumhuriyet.com.tr\/haber\/turkiye\/500929\/iddia_dogruysa__istiklal_deki_canli_bombanin_yesil_karti_bile_var_.html","http:\/\/www.jpost.com\/Middle-East\/ISIS-Threat\/Suspected-Istanbul-bomber-an-ISIS-terrorist-known-to-Turkish-authorities-448540","http:\/\/www.birgun.net\/haber-detay\/canli-bomba-adiyaman-dan-istanbula-patlama-gunu-gelmis-106868.html"]}

{"title":"2016 Atat\u00fcrk Airport attack","article":"-->\n}}\n\nThe Atat\u00fcrk Airport attack, consisting of shootings and suicide bombings, occurred on 28 June 2016 at Atat\u00fcrk Airport in Istanbul, Turkey. Gunmen armed with automatic weapons and explosive belts staged a simultaneous attack at the international terminal of Terminal 2. Three attackers and forty-five other people were killed, with more than 230 people injured. Monitoring group Turkey Blocks identified widespread internet restrictions on incoming and outgoing media affecting the entire country in the aftermath of the attack.\n\nMedia reports indicated that the three attackers were believed by Turkish officials to have come from Russia and Central Asia. Turkish officials said the attackers were acting on behalf of the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant and had come to Turkey from ISIL-controlled Syria. Commentators suggested that the attacks may have been related to stepped-up pressure against the group by Turkish authorities. No one claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\n==Background==\nIstanbul had already been subjected to three terrorist attacks in the first half of 2016, including suicide attacks in January and in March that were both linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and a car bombing in early June claimed by the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks (TAK), a \"radical offshoot of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)\".\n\nAfter the attack, United States CIA director John O. Brennan said that the attack bore the hallmarks of an ISIL terror attack. It was suggested that Turkey was paying a price for former Prime Minister and now President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan's wilful blindness to ISIL threat, and that Turkey, after previously being a conduit for fighters joining ISIL, was beginning to feel the wrath of the group for taking a harder line. The Washington Post wrote that \"perhaps not by chance, what was merely the latest in a series of Islamic State attacks inside Turkey came just as its impulsive and increasingly autocratic president was moving to repair his regime\u2019s threadbare foreign relations.\"\n\n==Attacks==\n\nShortly before 22:00 Istanbul time, two assailants approached the x-ray scanner at a security checkpoint, and opened fire. Police officers returned fire, and the assailants detonated bombs on their persons.\n\nBased on a security camera video, one of the bombers was about  inside Terminal 2 (the International terminal) when he detonated his suicide bomb. In the CCTV video the explosion can be seen within or near a group of people. According to Turkish officials, one of the explosions was set off by a third attacker in the parking lot across the street from the terminal.\n\nA closed-circuit television video of this incident showed an armed assailant walking and firing at people within the terminal. The gunman was then shot by a security officer and fell to the ground, with the security officer approaching to investigate. The officer then ran away, presumably having noticed the gunman's explosive belt. The suicide belt then detonated.\n\nDuring and immediately after the attacks, hundreds of passengers and people inside the airport hid anywhere they could in shops, washrooms, and under benches.\n\nTwo of the attackers detonated explosive devices, killing themselves; one other was killed, presumably by security forces.\n\nThere were three perpetrators who detonated their explosives in or near the terminal. However, there were reports and witnesses stating that there were four armed men running away from the blasts; this has not yet been confirmed by police personnel. A US intelligence source told CBS News that the coordinated attacks lasted only about 90 seconds.\n\nMany travelers described what they saw during the attack to reporters. One man stated, \"We came right to international departures and saw the man randomly shooting. He was just firing at anyone coming in front of him. He was wearing all black. His face was not masked. I was 50 meters away from him.\" He continued, \"We ducked behind a ticket counter but I stood up and watched him. Two explosions went off shortly after one another. By that time he had stopped shooting.\" Lastly he said \"He turned around and started coming towards us. He was holding his gun inside his jacket. He looked around anxiously to see if anyone was going to stop him and then went down the escalator ... We heard some more gunfire and then another explosion, and then it was over.\"\n\nOther people who had arrived outside the terminal said that taxicab drivers were screaming, \"Don't enter! A bomb exploded!\" from their windows to incoming traffic.\n\n==Casualties== \n48 people (including the three attackers) were killed, and more than 230 people were injured. Many of the victims were Turkish nationals, but people of other nationalities were also among the dead. \n\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nFollowing the attack, all departure flights were suspended but the arrival flights remained operational for some time until they were diverted. According to Flightradar24, most of the Istanbul-bound flights diverted to either Izmir or Ankara. Following the attack the FAA suspended all Turkish flights into and out of the United States for about five hours, allowing only the 10 flights that were already in the air during the attack to land in the U.S. All the flights suspended were Turkish Airlines flights. It is believed that between 8 and 14 aircraft from numerous airlines were at the terminal during the attack, none of the aircraft were ever in danger nor were any of them damaged during the attack.\n\nA broad media blackout was imposed by the state shortly after the attack banning \"all news, interviews, and visuals regarding the incident\" in \"any written and visual media, digital media outlets, or social media.\" Independent internet monitoring group Turkey Blocks reported that social networks Twitter and Facebook were slowed to the point of being unusable at 1:06AM on 29 June, approximately three hours after the attack.\n\nIn the initial hours after the attack, several airports in the world stepped up their security. In the United States, security was tightened at major international airports, including John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport in New York, and Hartsfield\u2013Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, the busiest airport in the world. Officials stated that there were no credible threats to major airports in the U.S. In Indonesia, security at major international airports, such as Soekarno - Hatta International Airport in Jakarta, was tightened. Indonesian Transportation Minister Ignasius Jonan stated that the security status in every airport in Indonesia was alerted to yellow, meaning that an attack in airport was \"likely\". He also added that major seaports in Indonesia also tightened their security. In India, the security in several major airports, such as Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Sahar was beefed up; security was also stepped up at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Colaba, one of the sites of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Security in Kolkata's Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Airport was also tightened.\n\nIn social media, the hashtag #PrayForTurkey became popular. By 29 June, it had been used more than 300,000 times on Twitter, by people wanting to show solidarity with Turkey and the victims. Several photos went viral in response to the attack, such as an older meme by Le Monde cartoonist Plantu which drew a parallel with the suffering caused by terror attacks in Belgium and France. Taxis took wounded people to the nearest hospital.\n\n==Responsibility==\nPrime Minister Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m accused ISIL of carrying out the attack, but ISIL has not claimed responsibility.\n\nCNN reported on 30 June that Turkish officials have \"strong evidence\" that the attackers came from the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, Syria, that ISIS leadership was involved in planning of the attack, and that the men entered Turkey about a month ago from Raqqa, bringing with them the suicide vests and bombs used in the attack.\n\nOn 30 June, the BBC reported that the attackers were from the Russian North Caucasus region, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. Previously it was reported the attackers spoke a language unfamiliar to their taxi driver, possibly Chechen. CNN reported that the gunmen were from the two Central Asian countries and Russia. Turkey has identified two of the attackers as Russian nationals Rakim Bulgarov and Vadim Osmanov, while not identifying the third.\n\nOn 1 July, a report quoted a highly placed U.S. congressman as saying the attack had been organized by a Chechen extremist known to be a top ISIS lieutenant, Akhmed Chatayev. U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, stated that Chatayev directed the attack. Turkish and Swedish media also identified Chatayev as the mastermind, who was granted political asylum in Austria. Chatayev served nine months in a Swedish prison in 2008 after being convicted of smuggling weapons into Sweden.\n\nTwo of the three attackers were identified as Rakim Bulgarov and Vadim Osmanov, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency. The trial for forty-six people accused being involved in the attack started on 13 November 2017 in Silivri.\n\n==Reactions==\nFollowing the bombings, several structures around the world were illuminated in the colours of the Turkish flag.\n\n===National===\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan issued a statement condemning the attack, which took place during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. He said the attack \"shows that terrorism strikes with no regard to faith and values\", called on the international community to take a firm stand against terrorism, and vowed to keep up Turkey's struggle against terror groups. Erdogan also stated, \"Turkey has the power, determination and capacity to continue the fight against terrorism until the end.\"\n\nTurkey declared 29 June as day of national mourning in response to the attack. The statement came from Prime Minister Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m to commemorate the victims of the attack. During the attack, the Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama's plane was landing when the attack occurred. He was evacuated from Atat\u00fcrk into an official residence. He was visiting Turkey for an official visit.\n\nOn 29 June, Turkish authorities detained 22 people in response to the attack: thirteen in Istanbul and nine in the coastal city of Izmir. Turkish authorities confirmed that the perpetrators were foreign nationals, specifically, they came from Uzbekistan, Russia and Kyrgyzstan.\n\nThe airport and wider community made a swift return to ordinary routine following the attack. Airport visitors reported that public transport was at full capacity in the days that followed, and that locals were still highly concentrated in the market squares.\n\n===International===\nAt least 80 countries, either through statements or official actions by their heads of state or their foreign ministries, condemned the attacks, expressed sympathy or support to Turkey and the victims of the attacks.\n\nThe United Nations likewise condemned the attacks, and the Council of Europe and the European Union extended their condolences and solidarity for Turkey.\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Council condemned internet restrictions imposed by the Turkish government to limit coverage of the incident, labelling them a \"violation of international human rights law.\"\n\nIsrael, the Republic of China (Taiwan), Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States issued travel advisories discouraging travel to Istanbul following the attacks. U.S. flights from and to Turkey were suspended for several hours in relation to the attacks. Police in New York and New Jersey boosted the security of airports in their states.\n\n==See also==\n* 2015 Ankara bombings\n* 2015 Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en Airport bombing\n* June 2016 Istanbul

{"title":"2016 Lahore suicide bombing","article":"On 27 March 2016, Easter Sunday, at least 75 people were killed and over 340 injured in a suicide bombing that hit the main entrance of Gulshan-e-Iqbal Park, one of the largest parks in Lahore, Pakistan. The attack targeted Christians who were celebrating Easter.  The majority of victims were women and children. Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, a group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack. The attack led to worldwide condemnation and national mourning throughout Pakistan. Pakistan also launched a widespread counter-terrorism operation in South Punjab, arresting more than 200 people.\n\n==Background==\nThe Pakistani Taliban operates as an umbrella organization for various Islamist militant groups in Pakistan. These extremist groups have frequently attacked Christians, who make up 2% of Pakistan's population. Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, the perpetrator of the current attack and once a breakaway organisation that reunited in March 2015 have declared their intention to carry out more attacks in the future.\n\n==Bombing==\nThe bombing took place at 18:30; a Rescue 1122 spokesman stated that they received an emergency call around 18:44, and 23 ambulances were sent to the location. The perpetrator used an explosives-packed vest. More than 40 bodies arrived at Jinnah Hospital. A shortage of ambulances forced taxis and rickshaws to transport the injured. Responsibility was claimed by the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, a group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban that had previously been responsible for bombings at two Lahore churches on 15 March 2015. A statement by Jamaat-ul-Ahrar spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan said the attack targeted Christians.\n\nWitnesses reported that the blast occurred at the entrance of the park. There were Christians in the park due to Easter, although there was no celebration of Easter on the park. The front entrances were crowded with people including children. Witnesses reported that 'children body parts' were flying in every direction. Due to the blast force, several bodies were flung into the air. The blast could be heard many kilometres away. Local residents reported that the noise was deafening. Shortly afterwards, total chaos erupted; everyone was screaming and running. A witness said:\nIt was so crowded that there was even no way of entering it. We went to a canteen to have something to eat, when there was suddenly a big blast. Everyone panicked, running to all directions. Many of them were blocked at the gate of the park. Dead bodies can be found everywhere.\n\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter the attack, citizens rushed to hospitals in response to urgent requests for blood donations. On-demand cab service, Careem, offered free rides to the hospital for blood donors while activists also used social media to coordinate relief efforts, including donating blood, food, and cash. Half of the more than 300 victims were taken to Jinnah Hospital in Lahore on Sunday night. 67 remained in the hospital with various injuries such as burns and shrapnel wounds, doctors said.\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif held a meeting in response to the bombing. Pakistan's army chief, General Raheel Sharif, also convened an emergency meeting of the country's intelligence agencies to begin to track down those responsible for the attacks. On 28 March, Prime Minister Sharif directed law enforcement agencies to step up counter-terror operations against terrorists and their abettors in southern Punjab. The prime minister issued these orders to the LEA's while chairing a high-level meeting at the Chief Minister House in Lahore to review the attack and overall strategy against terrorists. He later said his government goal was to \"eliminate terror infrastructure\" from Pakistan but also the extremist mind-set which was a threat to our way of life.\n\nThe chairman of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, Imran Khan, visited the victims of the blast in Jinnah Hospital. He later told the media that the current government needs to implement the National Action Plan and develop a consensus to go after terrorists in whichever province they are seeking refuge. He added that Pakistan's Government had failed to provide security to Pakistani people and that it must revisit its priorities. He later condemned the attack by saying: \"It is strictly against the teachings of our Holy Prophet (Muhammad) and basic principles of Islam.\"\n\nOn 28 March, in Punjab, several suspected terrorists were arrested along with firearms with full ammo recovered in different parts in Lahore, Faisalabad, and Multan. Since the night of 27 March, the army had conducted a military operation for capturing the terrorists. Al Jazeera noted that the bombing \"underscored\" both the \"precarious position\" of Pakistan's minorities and the fact that the fighters from armed groups \"are still capable of staging wide-scale assaults despite the months-long military offensive targeting their hideouts and safe havens in remote tribal areas\". On 29 March, Pakistani authorities conducted a counter terror operation with more than 5,000 questioned, and more than 200 suspects detained. Anonymous government and security sources told Reuters that a decision has been made to launch a full-scale crackdown on Islamist militants in Punjab, which may involve the paramilitary Rangers, who have been operating in Karachi for the last two years.\n\n==Reactions==\nPresident of Pakistan, Mamnoon Hussain; Governor of Punjab, Malik Muhammad Rafique Rajwana; and Chief Minister of Punjab, Mian Shahbaz Sharif, condemned the attack and announced three days of mourning. Business leaders announced that all shopping malls, bazaars, and markets in Lahore would be closed on 28 March, the day following the bombing. Several news agencies in Pakistan, such as the Express Tribune, changed their websites to display everything only in greyscale.\n\nThe Pakistan Army said it would begin military operations across Punjab in response to the bombings, targeting militants, their facilitators and their hideouts.

{"title":"January 2016 Istanbul bombing","article":"On 12 January 2016, a suicide attack in Istanbul's historic Sultanahmet district killed 13 people, all foreigners, and injured 14 others. The attack occurred at 10:20 local time, near the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia, an area popular among tourists. The attacker was Nabil Fadli, a Syrian member of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).\n\n==Background==\n\nThe last major attack on Sultanahmet Square occurred on 6 January 2015, when a suicide bomber detonated herself at a police station. The DHKP-C initially took responsibility for the attack but later retracted this claim. It was later revealed that the suicide bomber was Diana Ramazanova, a national of Dagestan origin with links to ISIL.\n\nIn 2015, Turkey suffered two major bombing attacks. In July, 33 people were killed in an ISIL suicide attack in the town of Suru\u00e7, near Turkey's border with Syria. In October, two suicide bombers detonated explosives which killed more than 100 people outside Ankara's main train station as people gathered for a peace rally. It was Turkey's deadliest attack. The prosecutor's office said it was carried out by a local ISIL cell.\n\nIn December 2015, Turkish police detained two suspected ISIL militants believed to be planning suicide attacks during New Year's celebrations in central Ankara, following which the government of Turkey cancelled planned New Year's celebrations in Ankara. There were additional arrests connected to ISIL on 11 January of three men arrested en route to Diyarbakir.\n\n==Attack==\n\nThe blast struck at 10:20\u00a0a.m. local time (08:20 UTC) at a park that is home to the landmark Obelisk of Theodosius, when the bomber walked up to a tour group standing in Sultanahmet Square and blew himself up.  The obelisk is  some  from the historic Blue Mosque and the blast was heard from several surrounding areas in the city.  Police cordoned off the area.  Graphic images of the explosion and its aftermath spread across social media.\n\nThirteen were killed in total; twelve were German tourists, and one was Peruvian. The Guardian reported that \"the bombing happened close to the German built fountain next to the plaza between the mosques of Hagia Sophia and Sultan Ahmet.\" News media reported that nine people were wounded including six Germans, one Norwegian, one Peruvian and a South Korean.\n\n===Perpetrator===\nTurkish authorities identified the suicide bomber as Nabil Fadli (born 1988), a Syrian. According to the Saudi Arabian Interior Ministry, Fadli was born in Saudi Arabia; he and his family left that country when he was eight years old, and Fadli grew up in Manbij in northern Syria, a region ever under ISIL control. Fadli's family is ethnically Turkman. According to reports, Fadli was \"a regular foot soldier\" in ISIL and his brother committed a suicide bombing at an airport several months earlier.\n\nFadli entered Turkey on January 5, 2016, and had been registered and fingerprinted as a refugee. His name had not set off security alerts.\n\n==Reaction==\nTurkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu said firstly that the perpetrator of the attack was a 28-year-old Syrian man who was affiliated with ISIL. He further said that the bomber was not on Turkey's militant watch-list and was believed to have recently crossed into Turkey from Syria. Davuto\u011flu also called German Chancellor Angela Merkel to offer his condolences. Davuto\u011flu immediately convened a security meeting with the Turkish interior minister. He said \"We pledged to battle the [ISIL] until it no longer \"remains a threat\" to Turkey or the world. Turkey won't backtrack in its struggle against Daesh [i.e., ISIL] by even one step. This terror organization, the assailants and all of their connections will be found and they will receive the punishments they deserve.\"\n\nFollowing the attack, the Turkish government's Radio and Television Supreme Council imposed a temporary broadcast ban on images of to the bombing (under a 2011 law allowing such censorship), and the ban was affirmed by an order from an Istanbul court.\n\n===International reactions===\n\n\n==== Supranational ====\n*: In a letter to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker expressed his \"heartfelt condolences\" to Erdo\u011fan and to the people of Turkey.\n\n==== States ====\n*: German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed \"serious concern\" about the casualties, saying \"a German tourist group had been affected.\" Germany's foreign ministry has on its website urged German tourists in Istanbul to avoid large crowds and tourist attractions and warned that further violent clashes and \"terrorist attacks\" were expected across Turkey.\n*: The Malaysian government has strongly condemned the attack and expressed its deepest condolences to the government and people of Turkey as well to the families and victims involved.\n*: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a press statement, condemned the attack. The President and Prime Minister said the people and Government of Pakistan stand firmly with their Turkish brethren at this hour of grief.\n*: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan have condemned the attack and stand with the Turkish people and government.\n*: State Department: \"The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attack today in Sultanahmet Square in Istanbul, Turkey. We extend our deepest condolences to the families of those killed, and wish a quick and full recovery to those injured.

The attacks were especially directed at soldiers, public defense workers, and recruits, as a consequence of the 18-month-old civil war between the Houthi movement and Hadi's supporters.\n\n== Incident ==\nOn 29 August 2016, recruits at an army training camp had queued in line for breakfast, which was brought into the compound by a truck. The suicide bomber, a suspected member of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, entered the compound behind this truck. He then drove his vehicle into the gathering of people, blowing himself up in a suicide car bomb attack and killing himself. The large explosion collapsed the roof of a building, burying many people while causing damage to nearby buildings. Debris from the bombing was found all over the compound. At least 72 people were killed while at least 67 people were injured.\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Yemen Post Hakim Almasmari called the incident a massacre, while stating that it is the worst terrorist attack that has ever occurred in Aden. Although Al-Qaeda has a large presence in the area, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant were the only ones to claim responsibility for the bombing.\n\n== Reaction ==\nPresident of Yemen, Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi condemned the bombing and called it a \"cowardly terrorist act\" of militants.\n\n==See also==\n*List of terrorist incidents, 2016\n*Yemeni civil war (2015\u2013present)\n*23 May 2016 Yemen bombings\n*June 2016 Mukalla attacks\n*May 2016 Yemen police bombings\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/www.manilatimes.net\/is-suicide-bomber-kills-71-army-recruits-in-yemen\/282979\/","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/08\/30\/world\/middleeast\/yemen-suicide-attack-aden.html?_r=0","https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/middle-east\/yemen-bombing-suicide-attack-leaves-at-least-45-dead-at-army-camp-in-aden-a7214781.html","http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2016\/08\/yemen-death-toll-isil-aden-bombing-rises-70-160830040441997.html","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/suicide-bomber-kills-45-in-attack-on-pro-government-militia-in-southern-yemen\/2016\/08\/29\/664638e8-6dc3-11e6-9705-23e51a2f424d_story.html","https:\/\/aoav.org.uk\/2016\/deadliest-terror-attack-aden-year-isis-suicide-car-bomb-kills-70-army-recruiting-centre\/"]}
{"title":"Battle of El Adde","article":"The Battle of El Adde took place on 15 January 2016. Al-Shabaab militants launched an attack on a Kenyan-run AMISOM army base in the town of El Adde, Gedo, Somalia. It remains the deadliest attack on the AMISOM Peace Support Mission to Somalia and is the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) largest defeat since independence in 1963. As such, the Kenyan government went to extreme lengths to conceal the extent of its losses. It has been described by the media as a \"military massacre\" or military disaster. It was also the largest military defeat in Kenyan history.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 2011, Kenya joined the African Union Mission to Somalia. In that time, the KDF has occupied the southern Gedo Region of Somalia with a presence of around 3,000 troops.\n\nAccording to Somali army General Abas Ibrahim Gurey, clear and reliable intelligence of an imminent attack had been passed along to the commanding officer in charge of the El Adde base, 45 days in advance.\n\n== Kenyan army base attack ==\nOn 15 January, at 6:30 a.m before morning prayers, a suicide bomber detonated his explosive laden armoured personnel carrier to the front gate to an AMISOM garrison base in El-Adde, Gedo, Somalia. The base compound housed a Company-sized garrison of men belonging to both the 9th and 5th Kenya Rifles. Both Kenyan Rifle Battalions were detached to the El-Adde base only two weeks beforehand. The total size of the garrison that day has been generally put at around 200 Kenyan troops present.\n\nAccording to KDF spokesperson General Samson Mwathethe, the explosion was three times more powerful than the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Nairobi. The massive blast damaged the command and communications buildings, as well as an armory and fuel depots of the base, killing dozens of soldiers. Al Shabaab named the suicide bomber as AbduQadir Ali.\n\nThe suicide explosion was a precursor to an estimated 150 to 300 Al-Shabaab fighters assaulting the base with rocket-propelled grenades and assault weapons. The attack caught Kenyan troops unprepared and asleep. At approximately 7:30 a.m, the battle lasted for more than one hour of fierce fighting, until Kenyan troops were routed from the base and fled into the dense bush pursued by Al Shabaab militants.\n\nA neighboring Somali National Army (SNA) base located 600 meters away from the AMISOM base, was empty of troops, who allegedly left and were pre-warned hours before the attack, per the Kenyan military. It was initially reported that the SNA base came under assault and Kenyan troops were supporting the Somali Army and that the KDF had incurred unspecified losses. However, this story was revised.\n\n===Tactical failures===\nAccording to the Cable News Network (CNN), \"The apparent ease with which the militants breached barriers at El Adde has surprised many security analysts -- especially since the same style of assault had been seen before in bloody attacks on AMISOM forces.\"\n\nOne Western diplomat based in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, told CNN this was clearly a \"tactical disaster\" for the Kenyans.\n\"How can two hundred Al-Shabaab walk across a field in broad daylight without the Kenyans noticing? Where were the KDF's machine guns?\" he asked. \"This is contrary to everything they have been taught, and should be doing in a hostile environment.\"\n\n== Casualties ==\nAl Shabaab claimed to have captured 12 Kenyan soldiers, including the commanding officer after the battle. Later al-Kat\u0101i\u2019b Media associated with Al-Shabaab, released a 48-minute-long propaganda video showing the bodies of at least 63 dead KDF soldiers and captured military hardware, including several tanks and long range field artillery. They later claimed to have killed over 100 Kenyan troops, although this has been deemed an understatement. This number does not include ethnic-Somali soldiers in Kenyan uniform.\n\nA new death toll from available open source information indicates that ranges from 141 to 185 Kenyan troops, including all officers, were killed in action. Around 40 survivors managed to escape and an unknown number are still unaccounted for. Separately, DNA samples were taken from 143 bodies at the scene, most of which were burned beyond recognition.\n\n== Aftermath and reactions ==\nKenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta expressed his condolences to the families and vowed militants would pay a heavy price for the attack. He reaffirmed Kenyan support in the AMISOM Peace Support Mission to Somalia and ruled out withdrawal of troops from Somalia. Declaring the terrorists will have no time to breathe. \"We will not be cowed by these cowards. With our allies, we will continue in Somalia to fulfill our mission. We will hunt down the criminals involved in today's events. Our soldiers\u2019 blood will not be shed in vain.\" Kenyan bishops around the country offered condolences.\n\nThe Somali president Hassan Sheikh Mohamud condemned the attack. In a later interview with Somali Cable TV, he described the attack as a \"defeat\" in a line of victories and put the KDF death toll at close to 200 fatalities. However, according to a Somali presidential spokesman, he was \"misquoted\" on the precise casualty figures when questioned by the Kenyan military.\n\nNigerian president Muhammadu Buhari along with Somali president Hassan Sheikh Mohamud made a three-day visit to Kenya to attend a ceremony in honor of the soldiers killed at the Moi army barracks in Eldoret, Kenya.\n\nOn 22 January, the alleged mastermind of the El Adde attack and leader of the Al Shabaab \"Abu Zubair battalion\", Maalim Janow, was killed in retaliatory airstrikes according to Kenya's military.\n\n===Cover-up===\nAccording to CNN, \"to prevent details of what happened at El Adde from emerging, Kenya's government used a rarely enforced law prohibiting the distribution of images or information likely to cause public fear and alarm or undermine security operations. One local blogger who tweeted a photograph showing of the aftermath of the attack was promptly arrested. He was later released without charge.\"\n\n\"There is clearly an attempt to mislead Kenyans and to hide the truth about what happened,\" said Patrick Gathara, a political commentator and cartoonist who lashed out at the KDF and Kenyan government in local newspapers after the attack. \"It is being hidden to avoid accountability.\"\n\"Who died for you in El Adde?\" Gathara believes there is a deliberate attempt \"to avoid accountability.\"Added Gathara, \"It is all very deliberate and designed to avoid public demands for senior officials and officers to be held responsible for failures. \"The truth about El Adde is being hidden from Kenyans, not from Al-Shabaab.\"\n\nCNN reports, \"Tellingly, Al-Shabaab's propaganda video uses the Kenyan authorities' own words against them, highlighting the inaccurate KDF press release sent in the immediate aftermath of the attack, and accusing the KDF of \"distorting the truth and blatantly lying to their public.\"\nAnalysts say the KDF's lack of transparency has only provided more fodder for Al-Shabaab's ideological battle.\"\n\n\"Although they cite national security reasons, what they end up doing is creating an opportunity for Al-Shabaab to propagandize their victories, perhaps exaggerate them,\" said Peter Pham, director of the Atlantic Council's Africa Center.\"But there's no way of countering that narrative because there is no real narrative coming from the government.\"\n\n\"The AU [African Union] would be better served by contesting the Al-Shabaab narrative, not ceding ground to it,\" said Paul D. Williams, Associate Professor of International Affairs at George Washington University, who specializes in reporting on peacekeeping missions.\n\"Silence is not a winning strategy in the world of strategic communications,\" he told CNN in late January, shortly after the attack.\n\n==See also==\n* Westgate shopping mall attack\n* Garissa University College attack\n* Operation Linda Nchi\n* Operation Indian Ocean\n* Battle of Leego (2015)\n* List of terrorist incidents, January\u2013June 2016\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/www.standardmedia.co.ke\/mobile\/article\/2000193248\/fugitive-al-shabaab-terrorist-resurfaces-with-more-threats]<\/ref>","http:\/\/allafrica.com\/stories\/201604080081.html","http:\/\/www.the-star.co.ke\/news\/2016\/07\/02\/unanswered-questions-on-el-adde_c1378020]<\/ref>","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/01\/21\/world\/africa\/shabab-attacks-somalia-kenya.html","https:\/\/www.standardmedia.co.ke\/article\/2001265769\/brave-and-sharp-major-who-led-kdf-to-its-worst-ambush-in-somalia<\/ref>","http:\/\/www.shabellenews.com\/2016\/11\/un-releases-number-of-kdf-soldiers-killed-in-el-ade-attack\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170710202721\/http:\/\/www.shabellenews.com\/2016\/11\/un-releases-number-of-kdf-soldiers-killed-in-el-ade-attack\/","http:\/\/www.standardmedia.co.ke\/article\/2000192127\/al-shabaab-commander-behind-el-adde-attack-killed-in-kdf-strike]<\/ref>","http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-africa-35658500","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2016\/05\/31\/africa\/kenya-soldiers-el-adde-massacre\/index.html","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2016\/05\/31\/africa\/kenya-soldiers-el-adde-massacre\/index.html<\/ref>","http:\/\/allafrica.com\/stories\/201601281446.html","http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-africa-38218885","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/04\/13\/world\/africa\/militant-groups-compete-for-notoriety-in-east-africa.html?_r=0","http:\/\/www.the-star.co.ke\/news\/2016\/01\/28\/amisom-releases-photos-of-el-adde-attack-says-it-is-payback-time_c1284519]<\/ref>","http:\/\/www.standardmedia.co.ke\/article\/2000188732\/new-details-of-el-adde-attack-somali-general-claims-kdf-received-pre-attack-intelligence","http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-africa-35364593","http:\/\/www.standardmedia.co.ke\/?articleID=2000189227&story_title=dod-asks-families-of-missing-kdf-soldiers-to-go-for-dna-tests-to-help-identify-bodies","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/01\/21\/world\/africa\/shabab-attacks-somalia-kenya.html","http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-africa-35372855","http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2016\/01\/al-shabab-attacks-african-union-base-somalia-160115070814884.html","http:\/\/www.standardmedia.co.ke\/mobile\/article\/2000189903\/probe-team-seeks-role-of-somali-troops-in-el-adde-ambush","https:\/\/tuko.co.ke\/117364-al-shabaab-release-chilling-el-adde-propaganda-video.html","http:\/\/www.the-star.co.ke\/news\/2016\/04\/15\/90-days-on-kenya-remembers-dawn-raid-on-el-adde-kdf-base_c1329436?page=0%252C1","http:\/\/www.standardmedia.co.ke\/?articleID=2000188803&story_title=how-kdf-fought-10-hour-battle-to-save-ill-fated-camp","https:\/\/citizentv.co.ke\/news\/we-believe-weve-killed-mastermind-of-el-adde-attack-kdf-112396\/","http:\/\/allafrica.com\/stories\/201601201178.html","https:\/\/news.vice.com\/article\/al-shabaab-somalia-militants-broadcast-voices-captured-kenyan-soldiers-military-base-el-adde","http:\/\/www.standardmedia.co.ke\/article\/2000189296\/local-clan-in-el-adde-might-have-betrayed-kdf","http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/worldnews\/africaandindianocean\/somalia\/12101407\/Bodies-of-Kenyan-soldiers-dragged-through-Somali-streets-after-al-Shabaab-attack-on-base.html","http:\/\/www.the-star.co.ke\/news\/2016\/01\/26\/kenyan-troops-withdraw-from-el-adde-massacre-camp-in-somalia_c1283640","http:\/\/www.recoilweb.com\/attack-on-kdf-el-adde-93597.html","http:\/\/www.voanews.com\/content\/kenya-president-al-shabab-will-pay-heavy-price\/3152912.html","http:\/\/www.catholicherald.co.uk\/news\/2016\/01\/27\/kenyas-bishop-offers-condolences-after-soldiers-killed-by-al-shabab\/","http:\/\/allafrica.com\/stories\/201601180155.html","http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2016\/02\/killed-al-shabab-mortar-attack-somalia-160225101227367.html","http:\/\/www.the-star.co.ke\/news\/2016\/02\/28\/i-was-misquoted-somalia-president-says-on-report-200-kdf-troops-killed_c1303226","http:\/\/diplomat.so\/2016\/01\/27\/nigeriasomalia-to-honour-kenyas-fallen-soldiers\/","http:\/\/www.standardmedia.co.ke\/article\/2000188967\/kdf-soldiers-kill-al-shabaab-leader-who-plotted-deadly-raid"]}
{"title":"Daallo Airlines Flight 159","article":"Daallo Airlines Flight 159 was a scheduled international passenger flight operated by Somali-owned Daallo Airlines. On 2 February 2016, an explosion occurred on board the aircraft 20 minutes after it took off from Mogadishu. The aircraft was able to return to the airport safely, with one fatality (the bomber) reported. A subsequent investigation indicated that the explosion was caused by a bomb, detonated in a suicide attack. The Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab later claimed responsibility for the bombing. A total of ten people were convicted in relation to the plot.\n\n== Aircraft ==\nThe aircraft involved was a 19-year-old Airbus A321-111, SX-BHS, owned by Hermes Airlines, and operated by Daallo Airlines at the time of the incident. The aircraft was delivered to Daallo Airlines on 5 January 2015. The aircraft had previously been operated by Hermes Airlines, Air M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, Myanmar Airways International and Swissair. The aircraft's manufacturer serial number (MSN) is 642 and it first flew on 6 January 1997. The aircraft was delivered to Swissair on 21 January 1997. It is equipped with two CFM International CFM56 engines and has a 220-seat economy-only configuration. In March 2013, it experienced a runway excursion after landing at Lyon\u2013Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Airport.\n\n== Incident ==\n\nOn 2 February 2016, 20 minutes after taking off from Mogadishu, Somalia, at 11:00 local time, en route to Djibouti City, at an altitude of about , an explosion occurred aboard the aircraft, opening a hole in the fuselage behind the R2 door. It was reported that day that the explosion was most likely close to seats\u00a015\/16F, abeam the forward wing root and the fuel tanks. There were 74 passengers and 7 crew on board at the time of the incident.\n\nReacting to the explosion, flight attendants moved passengers to the rear of the aircraft. The pilots alerted Mogadishu tower, reporting a pressurisation problem, but did not declare an emergency. The aircraft returned to Aden Adde International Airport and performed an emergency landing. Two injuries were reported, and the burnt body of the suicide bomber fell from the aircraft, landing in the town of Dhiiqaaley near Balad, Somalia; it was found by nearby residents.\n\nThe flight had been delayed before departure, so at the time of the explosion the aircraft was not yet at cruising altitude and the cabin was not yet fully pressurized. It was thought that a laptop had been rigged with a timer device to explode the bomb mid-flight.\n\nAccording to Mohamed Ibrahim Yassin Olad, the CEO of Daallo Airlines, the suicide bomber and 69 of the 73 other passengers on board were meant to board a Turkish Airlines flight, which was cancelled on the morning of 2 February due to poor weather conditions. This resulted in Daallo Airlines rerouting the passengers to Djibouti, where they would be transferred to a Turkish Airlines flight. The cancellation of the Turkish Airlines flight was confirmed by Yahya Ustun, a spokesman for the company.\n\n== Investigation ==\nSomalia's Air Accident Investigation Authority (SAAIA) stated on 3 February that one person was missing from the aircraft once it had returned to Mogadishu and later confirmed that the missing person's body was found near Balad. An investigation into the bombing was carried out by the National Intelligence and Security Agency, with the cooperation of airport authorities and local police. Daallo Airlines, in a statement, said that a technical team of Hermes Airlines, the owner of the aircraft, as well as the aircraft's manufacturer, Airbus, played a role in the active investigation. The FBI also contributed its efforts to the investigation.\n\nInitial tests of the damage on Flight\u00a0159 confirmed traces of explosive residue. It is thought that a bomb, possibly hidden within a laptop, was carried onto the aircraft by a person in a wheelchair. The passenger was believed to have been transferred into a regular seat after being brought onto the plane. Two passengers on the plane, including one who was sitting in the next seat, were arrested on suspicion of being accomplices. On 6\u00a0February, Transport Minister Ali Ahmed Jama confirmed that the explosion was caused by a bomb that \"was meant to kill all onboard\".\n\nSomali authorities identified the deceased passenger as Abdullahi Abdisalam Borleh, a 55-year-old male from Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland region of Somalia, but did not confirm that he was suspected of being the suicide bomber. Borleh was a teacher at an Islamic school, and said he was going abroad for health reasons, according to Sheikh Mohamed Abdullahi, a mosque imam in Hargeisa. A Somali federal official stated that Borleh had been monitored by security agents, \"but we had never considered him to be dangerous\". A senior Somalia immigration official said that Borleh had obtained a Turkish visa to work in Turkey as an adviser for the foreign ministry. A letter was allegedly sent from the Somali Embassy in Ankara to the Turkish Embassy in Mogadishu, asking the Turkish Embassy to facilitate a visa for Borleh to be \"an adviser to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Investment Promotions\". The Somali Embassy in Ankara denied sending any such letter.\n\nA security camera recording from the airport shows two men, seemingly airport workers, giving a laptop to Borleh. US officials have said that investigators believe the bomber had some type of connection to airline or airport personnel.\n\nAt least 20 people, including government officials and the two airline employees, were arrested on suspicion of being linked to the attack. A Serbian pilot, Vlatko Vodopivec, criticised the lack of security around the aircraft at the airport, describing the facility as \"chaotic\". In an interview with the Associated Press, Vodopivec explained that \"the security is zero. When we park there, some 20 to 30 people come to the tarmac ... No one has a badge or those yellow vests. They enter and leave the aircraft, and no one knows who is who... They can put anything inside when passengers leave the aircraft.\"\n\nMohamed Ibrahim Yassin Olad, the CEO of Daallo Airlines, stated that the airline would keep flying to Somalia, despite the incident. \"We have been there for 25 years,\" he said. \"Our efforts to keep Somalia linked to the rest of the world will continue.\"\n\nOn 13 February, eleven days after the incident, the Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab, in an email statement, claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that it was \"retribution for the crimes committed by the coalition of Western crusaders and their intelligence agencies against the Muslims of Somalia.\" Al-Shabaab also said that it targeted Turkish Airlines because Turkey is a NATO state supporting Western operations in Somalia and that they were targeting Western intelligence officials and Turkish NATO soldiers who were on board.\n\n==Criminal convictions==\nOn 30 May 2016, a Somali military court found two men guilty of planning the plot and of being members of al-Shabab and sentenced them to life in prison. One of the two men was a former security official at the airport and the other, who financed the attack, had eluded arrest and was tried in absentia. Eight other airport workers were convicted of aiding the plot, but were not convicted of being members of al-Shabab, and were given prison sentences ranging from six months to four years. They worked a range of jobs at the airport, including security screeners, a police officer, a porter and immigration officers.\n\n== See also ==\n* Accidents and incidents involving the Airbus A320

{"title":"October 2016 Baghdad attacks","article":"-->\n}}\n\n\nOn 15 October 2016, four attacks in and around Baghdad, Iraq, resulted in the deaths of at least 60 victims and at least seven attackers, while injuring at least 80 more people. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant are believed to be behind the suicide bombing and two mass shootings.\n\n==Events==\nThe first attack occurred when a funeral was being held for a local resident in the al-Shaab district of Baghdad inside a tent. People were taking part in Shi'ite rituals, where they mourn the killing of the Islamic prophet Muhammad's grandson Husayn ibn Ali, which occurred during the 7th century. When they were doing this, a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest blew himself up in the middle of the gathering, killing at least 44 people and injuring at least 57. ISIL claimed this attack.\n\nThe second attack happened in Mutaibija, Tikrit, when gunmen opened fire on policemen, killing eight of them and injuring eleven. Three attackers were also killed.\n\nThe third attack in Ishaq occurred when gunmen stormed the house of the Ishaqi Mobilization militia leader Numan al-Mujamaie, killing his wife and three children, but al-Mujamaie was not present. They later killed themselves with explosive belts when they were pursued by police.\n\nA fourth later attack, a suicide bombing on a tent where Shia Muslims distribute food, killed at least four people and injured at least 12.\n\nMore attacks occurred the next day, killing at least 19 people, injuring at least 11, and killing another suicide bomber.\n\nThe attacks occurred during the preparation for the Battle for Mosul. A failed rebellion occurred in Mosul on the day of the attack, and ISIS reportedly executed 58 people, and later 14 more. The attacks were the deadliest in Baghdad since the 2016 Karrada bombing in July 2016.\n\n==See also==\n* 2016 Karrada bombing\n* 9 September 2016 Baghdad bombings\n* Muhammad ibn Ali al-Hadi Mausoleum attack\n* List of Islamist terrorist attacks\n* List of terrorist incidents in July 2016\n* Terrorist incidents in Iraq in 2016\n\n\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-idUSKBN12F06W","http:\/\/www.arabnews.com\/node\/998186\/middle-east","http:\/\/www.telesurtv.net\/english\/news\/Nearly-60-People-Killed-in-Iraq-by-Islamic-State-Group-Attacks-20161015-0005.html","http:\/\/original.antiwar.com\/updates\/2016\/10\/15\/funeral-bombed-baghdad-88-killed-iraq\/","http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2016\/10\/suicide-bomber-strikes-shia-muslim-gathering-baghdad-161016110357231.html","http:\/\/www.iraqinews.com\/iraq-war\/suicide-attack-targets-hussainiyah-march-jardiyah-bridge-central-baghdad\/","http:\/\/www.iraqinews.com\/iraq-war\/isis-pursues-families-sharqat-kills-12-persons-including-women-children\/","http:\/\/www.iraqinews.com\/iraq-war\/blast-kills-wounds-3-volunteer-soldiers-near-baqubah\/","http:\/\/www.iraqinews.com\/iraq-war\/ied-explosion-kills-wounds-9-civilians-kirkuk\/","http:\/\/mobile.reuters.com\/article\/idUSKBN12E0Z0"]}

{"title":"28 December 2017 Kabul suicide bombing","article":"The December 2017 Kabul suicide bombing occurred on 28 December 2017, when militants attacked a Shiite cultural centre in Kabul, Afghanistan. The attack killed 50 people and injured over 80.\n\nThe major explosion of the attack occurred in the Tebyan Cultural centre (also spelled \"Tabayan Cultural Centre\" and \"Tabian Cultural Centre\"), a Shia cultural organisation, located in the Shia-dominated Dashte Barchi area of Kabul. The cultural centre also housed the Afghan Voice Agency, with victims including journalists and university students. The bombing occurred during a discussion held to mark the 38th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The interior ministry of Afghanistan stated that two other explosions occurred soon afterwards, but did not cause any fatalities. Among those killed were two children. Most of those injured were suffering from burns. Photographs taken by eyewitnesses showed significant damage to the targeted building.\n\nThe so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the attack in an online statement released by the Amaq News Agency, operated by ISIL. The attack is among a series that has targeted Afghanistan's Shia minority, who are seen as heretics by the Islamic State. According to the United Nations, 12 attacks have targeted Shiites in Afghanistan since the beginning of 2016, in which more than 700 people have been killed. The Taliban denied responsibility for the attack soon after it occurred. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani described the incident as an \"unpardonable\" crime against humanity\".\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-afghanistan-blast-claim\/islamic-state-claims-kabul-suicide-bomb-attack-online-statement-idUSKBN1EM0VR","http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2017\/12\/kabul-killed-suicide-attack-afghan-voice-171228063628772.html","http:\/\/aa.com.tr\/en\/asia-pacific\/kabul-bombing-death-toll-rises-to-50\/1018752","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-42500769","http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/news\/international\/blast-at-afghan-news-agency-office-in-kabul-casualties-feared\/article22291923.ece","https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2017-12-28\/isis-claims-multiple-suicide-attacks-on-kabul-that-killed-40"]}

At least 28 people were killed; 40 others were injured, including the Senator. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for the attack. The attack was an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Haideri.\n\n== Bombing ==\nThe bombing took place as the suicide bomber targeted Haideri's convoy on the N-25 National Highway. The bomber rammed the motorcycle he was riding into the vehicle carrying Haideri. The vehicle was severely damaged in the blast. The attack occurred shortly after Haideri left Jama Masjid Hammadia, after attending a graduation ceremony and offering Friday prayers. Haideri, who was sitting in the front seat, survived but received injuries on his arms, leg and ear. His driver and another aide in the same vehicle were killed. Many vehicles and motorcycles, including a police car, were destroyed in the explosion.\n\nGhazanfar Ali, District Police Officer, Mastung, suggested after an initial probe that \"a suspected suicide bomber hit Maulana Haideri's car\". The Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan, Raza Rabbani, said that it was a suicide attack that targeted Haideri. After the attack while talking to the media Haideri said, \"I am alive, Allah has saved my life\u2026 broken pieces of the windscreen hit me. I am injured but safe.\"\n\n=== Victims ===\nMaulana Hafiz Qudratullah, Naib emir of JUI (F)'s Quetta district chapter; Iftikhar Mughal, director staff of the Senate; Haideri's driver and Abdul Waheed, an Anti-Terrorism Force official, were among those killed in the bombing.

Several bodies could not be identified.\n\nDr Faisal Manan, a National journalist, was among the injured, as were a young girl and a child.\n\n== Initial response and investigation ==\nSurvivors of the blast, several of whom were covered in blood, began picking up body parts that were lying scattered on the road. Immediately after the blast, security forces rushed to the site along with rescue workers. A state of emergency was declared at hospitals in Mastung and Quetta. The injured and the deceased were shifted to the District Hospital and the Nawab Ghous Bakhsh Raisani Memorial Hospital in Mastung. At least 10 seriously injured were shifted to the Trauma Centre of Civil Hospital, Quetta. While, after initial treatment Haideri along with three other injured was moved to the Combined Military Hospital in Quetta.\n\nAfter collecting evidence from the scene, an official of the bomb disposal squad confirmed that it was a suicide attack. He added that around ten kilogrammes of explosives were used for the explosion. Evidence found at the blast site included ball bearings and parts of the motorcycle. A search operation began after Levies personnel cordoned off the entire area.\n\n== Reactions ==\nThe President of Pakistan, Mamnoon Hussain, condemned the attack and expressed the state's resolve to protect the public by completely eradicating terrorism from the country. The Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, strongly condemned the attack and expressed his concern for the well-being of Maulana Haideri. The Chairman of Senate, Raza Rabbani, and the Interior Minister, Nisar Ali Khan, also condemned the attack, with Rabbani saying \"terrorists cannot deter [the] nation's resolve against militancy through such coward attacks\". The Speaker and the Deputy speaker of National Assembly also condemned the attack. Chief Minister Balochistan Nawab Sanaullah Zehri, while condemning the attack, directed the IG police to submit a report on the attack within 24 hours.\n\nNobel laureate Malala Yousafzai also condemned the attack. In a message, Malala wrote: \"I strongly condemn Mastung blast, I and my family are praying for the speedy recovery of Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri and others injured, prayers for the martyrs, terrorists want to weaken Pakistan through their heinous acts but Pakistanis stand united against terrorism and extremism.\"\n\nSpeaking to Geo News, JUI (F)'s Emir (chief) Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehman condemned the attack on Haideri before adding that Friday's attack was not the first on the party. \"Many of our dear companions have been martyred [in this attack],\" he said further, adding that, \"We have to continue to work for this country and the stability of Islam.\" Maulana Fazlur Rehman expressed his condolences to the families of the martyrs terming the attack a very painful incident for the nation and particularly the JUI. He added that \"such incidents will not stop us in our cause\". The JUI-F chief also said such incidents occur \"because we [JUI-F] stand with Pakistan, its law, and its Constitution\".\n\nChairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari condemned the attack saying, \"controlling the menace of terrorism was collective responsibility\". Chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, Imran Khan condemned the attack calling it \"worst terrorism incident\", and added that terrorist want to create unrest.\n\nOn 13 May, a strike was observed in Quetta to mourn the death of the victims of the blast. JUI-F's party workers and supporters also held a demonstration in Quetta in protest against the suicide attack.\n\nThe militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi Al Alami's spokesman also condemned the suicide attack, adding that the two groups have now split due to \"policy changes\".\n\n=== Local newspapers ===\nThe editorial of The News International noted that the attack \"is a reminder that the internal challenges we face are even greater and cannot be blamed on other countries\". An editorial in The Nation also mentioned that \"the narrative will soon turn towards blaming the 'foreign hand' that feed terrorists in Pakistan, it must be remembered that many of our terrorist groups are entities that are very much based in Pakistan\". The editorial in Dawn also echoed that \"the country's civil and military leaderships will unite to condemn the attacks and bemoan them as an attempt to sabotage CPEC by outside forces. While there may be some truth to those allegations, the twin attacks in Mastung and Gwadar almost certainly have very local roots\".\n\n=== International ===\n* : The Turkish Foreign Office condemned the terrorist attack, and expressed solidarity with the Government and people of Pakistan.\n\n== References ==","urls":["http:\/\/www.lanacion.com.py\/mundo\/2017\/05\/12\/atentado-suicida-en-pakistan-deja-al-menos-17-muertos-y-un-senador-herido\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20171012082239\/http:\/\/www.lanacion.com.py\/mundo\/2017\/05\/12\/atentado-suicida-en-pakistan-deja-al-menos-17-muertos-y-un-senador-herido\/","https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1332799","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170513093104\/https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1332799","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-39895174","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170513075147\/http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-39895174","https:\/\/en.dailypakistan.com.pk\/headline\/10-killed-several-injured-in-mastung-blast\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170512152154\/https:\/\/en.dailypakistan.com.pk\/headline\/10-killed-several-injured-in-mastung-blast\/","http:\/\/time.com\/4777048\/pakistan-bombing-assassination-attempt-senate\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170514000126\/http:\/\/time.com\/4777048\/pakistan-bombing-assassination-attempt-senate\/","http:\/\/www.geo.tv\/latest\/141504-Breaking-News-Roadside-blast-in-Mastung","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170512120629\/https:\/\/www.geo.tv\/latest\/141504-Breaking-News-Roadside-blast-in-Mastung","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/05\/12\/world\/asia\/pakistan-mastung-bomb-blast.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170513221532\/https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/05\/12\/world\/asia\/pakistan-mastung-bomb-blast.html","http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2017\/05\/blast-kills-pakistan-balochistan-170512095736342.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170514023019\/http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2017\/05\/blast-kills-pakistan-balochistan-170512095736342.html","https:\/\/tribune.com.pk\/story\/1408062\/maulana-abdul-ghafoor-haideri-injured-convoy-comes-attack-mastung\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170512135656\/https:\/\/tribune.com.pk\/story\/1408062\/maulana-abdul-ghafoor-haideri-injured-convoy-comes-attack-mastung\/","http:\/\/www.radiotnn.com\/25-killed-as-ghafoor-haidris-convoy-hit-by-suicide-bomber-in-mastung\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170515053733\/http:\/\/www.radiotnn.com\/25-killed-as-ghafoor-haidris-convoy-hit-by-suicide-bomber-in-mastung\/","http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/news\/international\/many-killed-deputy-chairman-senate-injured-in-blast-in-pakistan\/article18436281.ece","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170512122220\/http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/news\/international\/many-killed-deputy-chairman-senate-injured-in-blast-in-pakistan\/article18436281.ece","https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/388099-pakistan-bombing-convoy-mastung\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170513192026\/https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/388099-pakistan-bombing-convoy-mastung\/","https:\/\/www.samaa.tv\/pakistan\/2017\/05\/imran-khan-condemns-mastung-blast\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20171012085411\/https:\/\/www.samaa.tv\/pakistan\/2017\/05\/imran-khan-condemns-mastung-blast\/","https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1333042","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170514091155\/https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1333042","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-pakistan-blast-idUSKBN18815A","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170513085330\/http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-pakistan-blast-idUSKBN18815A","https:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/print\/204136-Mastung-attack","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170514081115\/https:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/print\/204136-Mastung-attack","http:\/\/nation.com.pk\/editorials\/13-May-2017\/mastung-attack","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170514035717\/http:\/\/nation.com.pk\/editorials\/13-May-2017\/mastung-attack","https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1332948\/attacks-in-balochistan","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170514031644\/https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1332948\/attacks-in-balochistan","https:\/\/www.samaa.tv\/pakistan\/2017\/05\/turkey-condemns-terrorist-attack-on-haideri\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170516153952\/https:\/\/www.samaa.tv\/pakistan\/2017\/05\/turkey-condemns-terrorist-attack-on-haideri\/"]}

{"title":"Manchester Arena bombing","article":"On 22 May 2017, an Islamist extremist suicide bomber detonated a shrapnel-laden homemade bomb as people were leaving the Manchester Arena following a concert by US singer Ariana Grande.\n\nTwenty-three people died, including the attacker, and 139 were wounded, more than half of them children. Several hundred more suffered psychological trauma. The bomber was Salman Ramadan Abedi, a 22-year-old local man of Libyan ancestry. After initial suspicions of a terrorist network, police later said they believed Abedi had largely acted alone but that others had been aware of his plans. In March 2020, the bomber's brother, Hashem Abedi, was found guilty of 22 counts of murder in relation to the attack.\n\nThe incident was the deadliest terrorist attack and the first suicide bombing in the United Kingdom since the 7 July 2005 London bombings.\n\n==Attack==\nOn 22 May 2017 at 22:31 BST (UTC+01:00), a suicide bomber detonated an improvised explosive device, packed with nuts and bolts to act as shrapnel, in the foyer area of the Manchester Arena. The attack took place after an Ariana Grande concert that was part of her 2017 Dangerous Woman Tour. 14,200 people attended the concert. Many exiting concert-goers and waiting parents were in the foyer at the time of the explosion. According to evidence presented at the coroner's inquest, the bomb was strong enough to kill people up to  away.\n\nGreater Manchester Police declared the incident a terrorist attack and suicide bombing. It was the deadliest attack in the United Kingdom since the 7 July 2005 London bombings.\n\n===Aftermath===\nAbout three hours after the bombing, police conducted a controlled explosion on a suspicious item of clothing in Cathedral Gardens. This was later confirmed to have been abandoned clothing and not dangerous.\n\nResidents and taxi companies in Manchester offered free transport or accommodation via Twitter to those left stranded at the concert. Parents were separated from their children attending the concert in the aftermath of the explosion. A nearby hotel served as a shelter for people displaced by the bombing, with officials directing separated parents and children there. Manchester's Sikh temples (gurdwaras) along with local homeowners, hotels and venues offered shelter to survivors of the attack.\n\n\nManchester Victoria railway station, which is partly underneath the arena, was evacuated and closed, and services were cancelled. The explosion caused structural damage to the station, which remained closed until the damage had been assessed and repaired, resulting in disruption to train and tram services. The station reopened to traffic eight days later, following the completion of police investigation work and repairs to the fabric of the building.\n\nAfter a COBRA meeting with Greater Manchester's Chief Constable, Ian Hopkins, on 23 May, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the UK's terror threat level was raised to \"critical\", its highest level. The threat level remained critical until 27 May, when it was reduced to its previous level of severe. In the aftermath of the attack Operation Temperer was activated for the first time, allowing up to 5,000 soldiers to reinforce armed police in protecting parts of the country. Tours of the Houses of Parliament and the Changing of the Guard ceremony at Buckingham Palace were cancelled on 24 May, and troops were deployed to guard government buildings in London.\n\nOn 23 May, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, via the Nashir Telegram channel, claimed the attack was carried out by \"a soldier of the Khilafah\". The message called the attack \"an endeavor to terrorize the mushrikin, and in response to their transgressions against the lands of the Muslims.\" Abedi's sister said that he was motivated by revenge for Muslim children killed by American airstrikes in Syria.\n\nThe Arena remained closed until September 2017, with scheduled concerts either cancelled or moved to other venues. It reopened on 9 September, with a benefit concert featuring Noel Gallagher and other acts associated with North West England.\n\nMay announced an extra \u00a313 million reimbursement from central government to Manchester's public services for most of the costs incurred by the attack in January 2018. Later that month, Chris Parker, a homeless man who stole from victims of the attack, was jailed for 4 years and three months.\n\n==Casualties==\n\nThe explosion killed the attacker and 22 concert-goers and parents who were in the entrance waiting to pick up their children following the show; 119 people were initially reported as injured. This number was revised by police to 250 on 22 June, with the addition of severe psychological trauma and minor injuries. In May 2018, the number of injured was revised to 800. The dead included ten people aged under 20; the youngest victim was an eight-year-old girl and the oldest was a 51-year-old woman. Of the 22 victims, twenty were Britons and two were British-based Polish nationals.\n\nNorth West Ambulance Service reported that 60 of its ambulances attended the scene, carried 59 people to local hospitals, and treated walking wounded on site. Of those hospitalised, 12 were children under the age of 16.  In total, 112 people were hospitalized for their injuries, and 27 were treated for injuries that did not require hospitalization.  Out of this total of 139, 79 were children.\n\nThe first doctor thought to have been on scene was an off-duty consultant anaesthetist, Michael Daley. In recognition of his bravery for the role he played in the immediate medical response to the incident, Daley's name was entered into the British Medical Association Book of Valour in June 2017.\n\n==Attacker==\n\nThe bomber, Salman Ramadan Abedi, was a 22-year-old British Muslim of Libyan ancestry. He was born in Manchester on 31 December 1994 to a Salafi family of Libyan-born refugees who had settled in south Manchester after fleeing to the UK to escape the government of Muammar Gaddafi. He had two brothers and a sister. He grew up in the Whalley Range area and lived in Fallowfield. Neighbours described the Abedi family as very traditional and \"super religious\". Abedi, his elder brother, and, prior to 2011, his father attended Didsbury Mosque. Abedi attended Wellacre Technology College, Burnage Academy for Boys and The Manchester College. A former tutor remarked that Abedi was \"a very slow, uneducated and passive person\". According to The Times, Abedi had been among a group of students at his high school who had accused a teacher of Islamophobia for asking them what they thought of suicide bombers. He also reportedly said to his friends that being a suicide bomber \"was ok\" and fellow college students raised concerns about his behaviour.\n\nAbedi's father was a member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, a Salafi jihadist organisation proscribed by the United Nations, and father and son fought for the group in Libya in 2011 as part of the movement to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi. Abedi's parents, both born in Tripoli, remained in Libya in 2011, while 17-year-old Abedi returned to live in the United Kingdom. He took a gap year in 2014, where he returned with his brother Hashem to Libya to live with his parents. Abedi was injured in Ajdabiya that year while fighting for an Islamist group. The brothers were rescued from Tripoli by the Royal Navy survey ship  in August 2014 as part of a group of 110 British citizens as the Libyan civil war erupted, taken to Malta and flown back to the UK. According to a retired European intelligence officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, Abedi met with members of the ISIS Battar brigade in Sabratha, Libya and continued to be in contact with the group upon his return to the UK. An imam at Didsbury mosque recalled that Abedi looked at him \"with hate\" after he preached against ISIS and Ansar al-Sharia in 2015.\n\nAbedi's sister claimed her brother was motivated by the injustice of Muslim children dying in bombings stemming from the American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War. A family friend of the Abedi's also remarked that Salman had vowed revenge at the funeral of Abdul Wahab Hafidah, who was run over and stabbed to death by a Manchester gang in 2016 and was a friend of Salman and his younger brother Hashem. Hashem later co-ordinated the Manchester bombing with his brother.\n\nAccording to an acquaintance in the UK, Abedi was \"outgoing\" and consumed alcohol, while another said that Abedi was a \"regular kid who went out and drank\" until about 2016. Abedi was also known to have used cannabis.  He enrolled at the University of Salford in September 2014, where he studied business administration, before dropping out to work in a bakery. Manchester police believe Abedi used student loans to finance the plot, including travel overseas to learn bomb-making. The Guardian reported that despite dropping out from further education, he continued to receive student loan funding as recently as April 2017. Abedi returned to Manchester on 18 May after a trip to Libya and bought bomb-making material, apparently constructing the acetone peroxide-based bomb by himself. It is known that many members of the ISIS Battar brigade trained people in bomb-making in Libya.\n\nHe was known to British security services and police but was not regarded as a high risk, having been linked to petty crime but never flagged up for radical views. A community worker told the BBC he had called a hotline five years before the bombing to warn police about Abedi's views and members of Britain's Libyan diaspora said they had \"warned authorities for years\" about Manchester's Islamist radicalisation. Abedi was allegedly reported to authorities for his extremism by five community leaders and family members and had been banned from a mosque; the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester, however, said Abedi was not known to the Prevent anti-radicalisation programme.\n\nOn 29 May 2017, MI5 launched an internal inquiry into its handling of the warnings it had received about Abedi and a second, \"more in depth\" inquiry, into how it missed the danger. The Daily Mail reported that MI5 had a policy of allowing Libyans in the UK to travel to fight against Gaddafi and return later, including some who had been under house arrest in the UK for counter-terrorist measures. On 22 November 2018, the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament published a report which said that MI5 had acted \"too slowly\" in its dealings with Abedi. The committee's report noted \"What we can say is that there were a number of a failings in the handling of Salman Abedi's case. While it is impossible to say whether these would have prevented the devastating attack on 22 May, we have concluded that as a result of the failings, potential opportunities to prevent it were missed.\"\n\n==Investigation==\n\nThe property in Fallowfield where Abedi lived was raided on 23 May. Armed police breached the house with a controlled explosion and searched it. Abedi's 23-year-old brother was arrested in Chorlton-cum-Hardy in south Manchester in relation to the attack. Police carried out raids in two other areas of south Manchester and another address in the Whalley Range area. Three other men were arrested, and police initially spoke of a network supporting the bomber; they later announced that Abedi had sourced all the bomb components himself, and that they now believed he had largely acted alone. On 6 July, police said that they believed others had been aware of Abedi's plans.\n\nAccording to German police sources, Abedi transited through D\u00fcsseldorf Airport on his way home to Manchester from Istanbul four days before the bombing. French interior minister G\u00e9rard Collomb said in an interview with BFM TV that Abedi may have been to Syria, and had \"proven\" links with ISIS. Abedi's younger brother and father were arrested by Libyan security forces on 23 and 24 May respectively. The brother was suspected of planning an attack in Libya, and was said to be in regular touch with Salman, and aware of the plan to bomb the Manchester Arena, but not the date. According to a Libyan official, the brothers spoke on the phone about 15 minutes before the attack was carried out. On 1 November 2017, the UK requested Libya to extradite the bomber's younger brother, Hashem Abedi to return to the UK to face trial for complicity in the murder of the 22 people killed in the explosion.\n\nPhotographs of the remains of the IED published by The New York Times indicated that it had comprised an explosive charge inside a lightweight metal container which was carried within a black vest or a blue Karrimor backpack. Most of the fatalities occurred in a ring around the bomber. His torso was propelled by the blast through the doors to the arena, possibly indicating that the explosive charge was held in the backpack and blew him forward on detonation. A small device thought to have possibly been a hand-held detonator was also found. US Congressman Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, indicated that the bomb contained the explosive TATP, which has been used in previous bombings. According to Manchester police, the explosive device used by Abedi was the design of a skilled bomb-maker and had a back-up means of detonation. Police also said Salman Abedi \"bought most of Manchester bomb components himself\" and that he was alone during much of the time before carrying out the Manchester bombing.\n\nOn 28 May, police released images showing Abedi on the night of the bombing, taken from CCTV footage. Further images showed Abedi walking around Manchester with a blue suitcase.\n\nAccording to US intelligence sources, Abedi was identified by the bank card that he had with him and the identification confirmed using facial recognition technology.\n\nA total of 22 people were arrested in connection with the attack, but had all been released without charge by 11 June following the police's conclusion that Abedi was likely to have acted alone, even though others may have been aware of his plans.\n\nOn 17 July 2019, Salman Abedi's brother Hashem was charged with murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to cause an explosion. He had been arrested in Libya and extradited to the UK. His trial began on 5 February 2020. On 17 March, Hashem Abedi was found guilty on 22 charges of murder, on the grounds that he had helped his brother to source the materials used in the bombing.\n\n===News leaks===\nWithin hours of the attack, Abedi's name and other information given confidentially to security services in the United States and France were leaked to the news media, leading to condemnation from Home Secretary Amber Rudd. Following the publication of crime scene photographs of the backpack bomb used in the attack in the 24 May edition of The New York Times, UK counterterrorism police chiefs said the release of the material was detrimental to the investigation.\n\nOn 25 May, Greater Manchester Police said it had stopped sharing information on the attack with the US intelligence services. May said she would make clear to President Trump that \"intelligence that has been shared must be made secure.\" Trump described the leaks to the news media as \"deeply troubling\", and pledged to carry out a full investigation. British officials blamed the leaks on \"the breakdown of normal discipline at the White House and in the US security services\". New York Times editor Dean Baquet declined to apologise for publishing the backpack bomb photographs, saying \"We live in different press worlds\" and that the material was not classified at the highest level.\n\nOn 26 May, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the United States government accepted responsibility for the leaks.\n\n=== Links with the Muslim Brotherhood ===\nAccording to a secret recording unveiled by the BBC, Mostafa Graf, the imam of the Didsbury Mosque where Salman Abedi and his family were regulars, made a call for armed jihad 10 days before Abedi bought his concert ticket.\n\nFollowing these revelations, the Manchester Police opened an investigation into the mosque and its Imam, who also fought with a Libyan Islamist militia. Mostafa Graf is a member of the International Union of Muslim Scholars, an organisation founded by the Muslim Brotherhood and Yusuf al-Qaradawi. Al-Qaradawi is known for having claimed, \"Suicide bombings are a duty\".\n\nHaras Rafiq, head of the Quilliam think tank, told The Guardian that the Muslim Brotherhood runs the Didsbury Mosque.\n\nThe Didsbury Mosque is controlled by The Islamic Centre (Manchester), an English association headed by Dr. Haytham al-Khaffaf, who is also a director of the Human Relief Foundation, a Muslim Brotherhood organisation blacklisted for terrorism by Israel. Between 2015 and 2016, al-Khaffaf's Human Relief Foundation received over \u00a31.5 million from the Qatar Charity, which is also subject of US counterterrorism surveillance.\n\n==Reactions==\n\n\n===United Kingdom===\n\n\nTheresa May condemned the bombing, and in a later statement following the June 2017 London attack, she stated that these attacks along with the 2017 Westminster attack were \"bound together by the single evil ideology of Islamist extremism\" and said this extremism was \"a perversion of Islam\". Queen Elizabeth II expressed her sympathy to the families of the victims. Campaigning for the upcoming general election was suspended by all political parties for two days after the attack. The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, called the attack \"evil\" and announced a vigil in Albert Square the following evening, which thousands attended. The Muslim Council of Britain also condemned the attack.\n\nOn 25 May 2017, a national minute's silence was observed to remember the victims.\n\nPolice reported a 500% increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes in the Greater Manchester area in the month following the attack. The Commission for Countering Extremism was created in the aftermath of the bombing.\n\n===International===\n\n\nCondolences were expressed by the leaders and governments of dozens of countries, United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland, President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker, Pope Francis, and secretary general of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation Yousef Al-Othaimeen.\n\nAriana Grande posted on Twitter: \"broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words. [sic]\" The tweet briefly became the most-liked tweet in history. Grande suspended her tour and flew back to her mother's home in Florida.\n\nOn 9 July 2017, a performance to benefit the Manchester bombing victims was held in New York City's The Cutting Room, called \"Break Free: United for Manchester\", with Broadway theatre and television performers interpreting Ariana Grande songs.\n\n===One Love Manchester===\n\nOn 4 June, Ariana Grande hosted a benefit concert in Manchester, entitled \"One Love Manchester\" at Old Trafford Cricket Ground that was broadcast live on television, radio and social media. At the concert, Grande performed along with several other high-profile artists. Free tickets were offered to those who had attended the show on 22 May. The benefit concert and associated Red Cross fund raised \u00a310\u00a0million for victims of the attack by early June and \u00a317\u00a0million by August. New Yorks Vulture section ranked the event as the No. 1 concert of 2017.\n\n==Kerslake Report==\nOn 27 March 2018, the Kerslake Report, \"an independent review into the preparedness for, and emergency response to, the Manchester Arena attack on 22nd May 2017\", was published; it found that the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service was \"brought to a point of paralysis\".\n\nThe Kerslake Report \"largely praised\" the Greater Manchester Police and British Transport Police, and noted that it was \"fortuitous\" that the North West Ambulance Service was unaware of the declaration of Operation Plato, a protocol under which all responders should have been withdrawn from the arena foyer.\n\nIt was critical of Vodafone, for the \"catastrophic failure\" of an emergency helpline hosted on a platform provided by Content Guru, saying that delays in getting information caused \"significant stress and upset\" to families. It also expressed criticism of some news media, saying, \"To have experienced such intrusive and overbearing behaviour at a time of such enormous vulnerability seemed to us to be completely and utterly unacceptable\", but noting that, \"We recognise that this was some, but by no means all of the media and that the media also have a positive and important role to play.\"\n\n==See also==\n* List of terrorist incidents in Great Britain\n* List of terrorist incidents in May 2017\n\n\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n\n* Manchester attack: Who were the victims?

The blasts occurred at the Muna Garage internally displaced persons (IDPs) camp.\n\nThe attacks, which were unleashed by three to five bombers at different locations, resulted in the deaths of three to five civilian camp residents as well as themselves - and injured 20 people.\n\nNo terrorist group claimed responsibility for the explosions, but jihadist insurgent group Boko Haram - who attacked Maiduguri many times before - are believed to be responsible.\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.thisdaylive.com\/index.php\/2017\/03\/23\/eight-persons-killed-20-injured-in-suicide-attacks-in-maiduguri\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170324045253\/https:\/\/www.thisdaylive.com\/index.php\/2017\/03\/23\/eight-persons-killed-20-injured-in-suicide-attacks-in-maiduguri\/","https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2017\/03\/22\/blasts-kill-4-injure-18-in-northeastern-nigeria-police-say.html","https:\/\/guardian.ng\/news\/five-suspected-bombers-three-idps-die-in-borno-multiple-blasts\/","http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2017\/03\/multiple-bomb-blasts-rock-nigeria-maiduguri-170322074812422.html\/"]}
{"title":"March 2017 Kabul attack","article":"On 8 March 2017, the Sardar Daud Khan Military Hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, was attacked by a group of gunmen, some of them dressed in white hospital robes. Government officials confirmed at least 49 people were killed in the hours-long assault, while 63 others were injured. By March 13 the unconfirmed death toll had surpassed 100, with an unknown number injured. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed to have carried out the attack, but officials suspected the Haqqani network instead.\n\n==Attack==\nAt about 09:00 local time, a suicide bomber destroyed the back entrance to the hospital, located in Kabul's affluent Wazir Akbar Khan district, home to the Presidential Palace and Hamid Karzai International Airport. At least five attackers dressed as medical staff then entered the building and began going from floor to floor, paying particular attention to the VIP wing where an army general and a former minister's relative were reported to be. The militants appeared to fire indiscriminately, with a witness describing a gunman \"wearing a white coat and holding a Kalashnikov [opened] fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors.\" Subsequent reports spoke of a savage attack, with the militants stabbing bed-ridden patients, throwing grenades into crowded wards, and shooting people in the head from pointblank range, including women and children.\n\nThe attackers occupied the hospital for about seven hours until military forces were deployed via the hospital's roof and were successful in neutralizing them. Norwegian Marinejegerkommandoen special forces stationed in Kabul supported the Afghan operation, though they did not take part in the fighting.\n\nDays after the assault reports emerged that suggested a simultaneous assault, with insiders involved as well. Surviving staff described two interns in their 20s who had worked in the hospital for months as participants in the attack, with one being the initial suicide bomber. Afghan sources later confirmed the reports, with Defense ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanish saying that \"the attack was carried out from both outside and inside [...] this could not have been possible without the help of people inside.\"\n\nAccording to Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Dawlat Waziri in a statement made shortly after the hospital had been cleared of attackers, about thirty people had been killed and fifty injured. On 9 March, Salim Rassouli, director of the Kabul hospital network, said that the death toll has risen to 49, with 63 wounded. By March 13 numerous sources, including survivors and members of the Afghan security forces, were reporting that the overall death toll and the number of militants involved was significantly higher than initially thought, with over 100 killed and scores more injured.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Amaq News Agency, affiliated with the Islamic State, distributed images of an attacker and victims, which the SITE Intelligence Group, a monitor of online activity from terrorist groups, said was the organization's way of taking responsibility for the attack. Government official, however, were quick to cast doubt on those claims, citing the complexity of the assault, as well as the fact that two floors containing Taliban patients were specifically not targeted.

{"title":"June 2017 Pakistan attacks","article":"On 23 June 2017, a series of terrorist attacks took place in Pakistan resulting in 96 dead and over 200 wounded. They included a suicide bombing in Quetta targeting policemen, followed by two blasts at a market in Parachinar, and the targeted killing of four policemen in Karachi.\n\nResponsibility for the Quetta attack was claimed by Jamaat-ul-Ahrar and ISIL, while no group accepted responsibility for the Parachinar attack. According to the Pakistani military, both attacks were coordinated from terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan.\n\n==Background==\nThe attacks followed earlier blasts that had occurred in Quetta and Parachinar in 2017: Quetta on 13 February and 21 April; and Parachinar on 21 January and 31 March. In response to these and other attacks, the Pakistani military had launched Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad in February which aimed to eliminate the \"residual\/latent threat of terrorism\". A period of relative calm followed in between, although Balochistan witnessed minor violence in June when three security personnel were injured from an improvised explosive device targeting their vehicle, and two Pakistan Navy sailors were killed after their vehicle was targeted in Jiwani.\n\nThe bombings were carried out on Jumu'atul-Wida, the last Friday of the Hijri month of Ramadan before the Eid ul-Fitr celebrations.\n\n==Attacks==\n===Quetta bombing===\nEarlier in the day, a suicide car bombing took place at 08:45 local time (03:45 GMT) at the Shuhada Chowk on Quetta's Gulistan Road targeting policemen. The attacker first attempted to ram his explosives-laden vehicle into a peripheral wall of the Inspector General of Police Ehsan Mehboob's office, situated in the area. The car was driven into the wall, but it failed to explode. The policemen present at the site, unaware of the fact that the car was rigged with explosives, recovered the vehicle from the wall and brought it to Shuhada Chowk. They ordered the driver \u2014 the would-be bomber, to get down and began searching the vehicle. The bomber refused to descend and instead triggered the explosives.\n\nAt least 14 people including seven policemen were killed; and 20 others including four military personnel, a woman, and a girl were injured. A checkpoint on Mission Road Chowk was destroyed by the blast. Two four-wheelers, rickshaws and motorcycles each were also destroyed and a vehicle carrying military personnel was damaged in the bombing. The shock-wave of the blast smashed windows of several buildings in the neighbourhood and brought down the walls of a nearby girls' school.\n\n===Parachinar bombings===\nHours after the bombing in Quetta, two back-to-back blasts hit the Turi Market near Tal Adda in Parachinar city of FATA's Kurram Agency.\nParachinar is a predominately Shia-populated town, located near the Afghan border. The first blast took place in the evening around 17:00 local time in Turi Market, located just outside of the city's recently designated Red Zone. The explosive device was planted in the market, where many people were busy shopping for Eid. The second explosion targeted rescuers and bystanders, as they rushed to help the survivors of the first blast. A suicide bomber detonated the explosives strapped to his body. At least 72 people were killed and more than 200 others were injured in the twin bombings.\n\n===Karachi targeted killings===\nSeparately in Karachi, unidentified gunmen opened fire on four policemen whilst they were observing iftar in the evening at a roadside restaurant in SITE, killing them on the spot.\n\n==Response and aftermath==\nIn Quetta, the local police, Balochistan Constabulary and Frontier Corps personnel cordoned off the area. The casualties were shifted to the Civil Hospital where a state of emergency was declared. The injured military personnel were driven to the Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Quetta. At least five of the injured sustained life-threatening injuries. The funeral prayers for the seven policemen were offered at the Police Lines, Quetta.\n\nIn Parachinar, security forces sealed off the affected area and conducted a search operation in the adjoining areas following the blast. A state-of-emergency was imposed across all hospitals in Parachinar. According to the ISPR, the Pakistan Army dispatched two helicopters from Peshawar to Parachinar \"for the speedy evacuation of the injured to Peshawar\" and airlifted 15 critically injured.\n\n===Investigation===\nAccording to Bomb Disposal Squad officials, 90 to 95 kilograms of explosives were used in the Quetta car bombing. While according to the Director General of Civil Defence, 75 kilograms of explosives were used in the attack. Authorities examined CCTV footage of the area to understand further details of the incident. According to Balochistan's Home Secretary Dr Akbar Harifal, security had been beefed up in Quetta and other areas of the province following the attack.\n\nAccording to the Director-General of ISPR, Major General Asif Ghafoor, security and surveillance of the Pakistan\u2013Afghanistan border was enhanced with stringent actions against illegal border crossers, in the aftermath of the Parachinar attack.\n\n===Counterterrorist operations===\nOn 24 June, police and military sources reported that five terrorists were killed and nine security personnel injured during an intelligence-based operation in Peshawar's Chamkani and Mathra areas. A \"high profile terrorist commander\" was reported amongst those killed.\n\n==Responsibility==\nAsad Mansoor, a spokesman of the banned Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (a Tehrik-i-Taliban splinter group), claimed his group was behind the Quetta bombing, while the militant Islamic State (ISIL) group also claimed responsibility, saying that one of its followers had carried out the attack. ISIL also released a photograph of the alleged attacker, identified as Abu Othman Khorasani. Anwarul Haq Kakar, a Balochistan government spokesman, said India had a role in the attack in Quetta.\n\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility for the Parachinar attack. Pakistan's interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said such incidents always took place whenever Pakistan's border with Afghanistan was opened up. He added: \"It is important that we police our borders effectively and protect them from outside threats.\"\n\nIn Karachi, pamphlets belonging to an unknown militant group \u2014 Ansar al-Sharia Pakistan \u2014 were found on the crime scene.\n\nOn 24 June, army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa chaired a high-level meeting in Rawalpindi and called on Afghanistan to \"do more\" in the fight against terrorism. According to the ISPR, the attacks in Quetta and Parachinar were linked to terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan which enjoyed the \"patronage of Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security (NDS) and India's spy agency Research and Analysis Wing\".\n\n==Reactions==\n\n\n===Domestic===\nIn Parachinar, protesters raided the Parachinar Press Club and severely wounded five journalists. The police then resorted to aerial firing to defuse the situation.\n\nPrime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif condemned the terrorist attacks, and ordered for security measures to be tightened across the country. Sharif reiterated that \"such acts of terrorism will be dealt with full power of the state\" and added that \"terrorists are attacking soft targets, and no Muslim can ever imagine to commit such horrific acts.\" President Mamnoon Hussain, Senate chairman Raza Rabbani, Punjab chief minister Shehbaz Sharif, Balochistan governor Muhammad Khan Achakzai, former president Asif Ali Zardari and other figures also issued statements denouncing the terrorist incidents.\n\nPakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf chairman Imran Khan condemned the attacks, terming them \"attacks against the nation\". Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto also condemned the blasts, sending \"prayers for the bereaved families\".\n\n===International===\n* : United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres condemned the Quetta and Parachinar bombings and extended his condolences to the victims' families. He expressed \"hopes [that] those responsible for these crimes will be swiftly brought to justice\".\n\n==See also==\n* 2017 Bahawalpur explosion, accidental oil tanker explosion two days later\n* Terrorist incidents in Pakistan in 2017\n* 2018 Mastung and Bannu bombings\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2017\/06\/23\/asia\/pakistan-quetta-attack\/index.html","https:\/\/tribune.com.pk\/story\/1325786\/least-five-injured-quetta-blast\/","https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1341501\/parachinar-quetta-mourn-amidst-rising-death-toll-from-attacks","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/06\/23\/world\/asia\/bombings-pakistan-parachinar.html","https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1341375\/tragedy-strikes-again","http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2017\/06\/pakistan-police-office-struck-deadly-quetta-blast-170623043059409.html","https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1341271","https:\/\/tribune.com.pk\/story\/1442639\/5-killed-bomb-explosion-outside-igp-office-quetta\/","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2017\/jun\/23\/pakistan-several-dead-after-car-bomb-near-police-chiefs-officein-quetta","https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1341299\/at-least-30-dead-100-injured-in-twin-explosions-in-parachinar","https:\/\/tribune.com.pk\/story\/1443149\/10-feared-dead-two-explosions-parachinar\/","https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1341912\/anger-grows-in-parachinar-after-three-attacks-in-six-months","https:\/\/www.samaa.tv\/pakistan\/2017\/06\/10-dead-60-injured-as-2-blasts-rock-parachinar\/","https:\/\/tribune.com.pk\/story\/1443187\/four-policemen-martyred-karachi\/","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-40385007","http:\/\/indianexpress.com\/article\/world\/pakistan-blast-several-feared-dead-in-explosion-in-parachinar-say-reports-4718816\/","https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1341492\/two-terrorists-including-commander-killed-in-peshawar-operation","http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/world\/la-fg-peshawar-pakistan-bomb-20170623-story.html","http:\/\/time.com\/4829835\/pakistan-bomb-attacks\/","http:\/\/www.firstpost.com\/world\/pakistan-bomibings-38-killed-121-injured-as-nation-suffers-three-blasts-in-parachinar-and-quetta-3739825.html","https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1341543\/time-for-other-stakeholders-in-fight-against-terrorism-to-do-more-coas","https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1341770\/nawaz-confident-of-better-ties-with-afghanistan","https:\/\/www.samaa.tv\/pakistan\/2017\/06\/pm-condemns-parachinar-bombings\/","http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2017\/06\/twin-blasts-kill-dozens-parachinar-market-170623141126819.html","https:\/\/www.geo.tv\/latest\/146859-explosions-in-parachinar","https:\/\/www.un.org\/apps\/news\/story.asp?NewsID=57057"]}

{"title":"14 October 2017 Mogadishu bombings","article":"On 14 October 2017, two truck bombings took place in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, killing at least 587 people and injuring 316 others. Almost all of the casualties were caused by one of the trucks, which detonated when the driver, while attempting to escape from security officials, crashed through a barrier and exploded in the Hodan District, destroying a hotel; the intended target of the attack is believed to have been a secure compound housing international agencies and troops. The second blast happened close by, killing two people. A third explosives-laden truck was captured by police.\n\nThough no organisation claimed responsibility, officials stated that a key member of the cell that carried it out told them Islamist group Al-Shabaab was responsible.\n\nThe attack is the deadliest in Somalia\u2018s history, surpassing the 2011 Mogadishu bombing that killed 100 people, and the deadliest bombing in Africa. It is also the third deadliest terrorist bombing attack and the sixth-deadliest act of terrorism in modern history, surpassed only by the 1990 massacre of Sri Lankan Police officers in Sri Lanka, the 2008 Christmas massacres in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 2007 Yazidi communities bombings, the 2014 Camp Speicher massacre in Iraq, and the September 11 attacks in the United States. In response to the bombings, Somali president Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed declared three days of mourning.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the summer of 2011, the East African region faced a drought and shortage of food supplies, particularly in the Somali region, forcing tens of thousands of people to cross the borders into Ethiopia and Kenya for refuge. Al-Shabaab, a jihadist fundamentalist group designated as a terrorist organization by several countries, threatened to expel the aid groups working in the area before the African Union's AMISOM troops took action to force the al-Shabaab fighters out of the region.\n\nIn July 2010, al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for a bombing in Kampala, Uganda, in retaliation for Uganda's support to, and presence in, AMISOM.\n\nIn 2017, Somalia was continuing to suffer its worst drought in 40 years, with climatic catastrophe compounded by war and poor governance. Al-Shabaab banned humanitarian assistance in areas it controls, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to choose between starvation or brutal punishment.\n\nThe United States had a military involvement in Somalia until 1994, and had then withdrawn. Earlier in 2017 the US designated Somalia a \"zone of active hostilities\" (allowing it to apply looser rules and oversight concerning the authorization of drone strikes and ground operations), and the deployment of regular US forces to Somalia was again authorized. This saw America\u2019s ground forces in Somalia increase from about 50 in 2016 to 400 in 2017.\n\nThe bombings occurred amidst deep public discontent and political divisions between federal and regional leaders.\n\n== Attacks ==\nOn 14 October 2017, a large truck filled with explosives was detonated at a busy crossroads near the Safari Hotel in the Hodan District, at least a kilometre from the Medina Gate. The effect of the bombing was compounded by a fuel tanker parked nearby that caused a massive fireball. Sources close to the government said that the truck contained 350\u00a0kg of home-made and military-grade explosives. The truck had been briefly detained at a checkpoint, but was allowed to proceed after local authorities vouched for it; it was then stopped by security officials while stuck in a traffic jam. When it was about to be searched, the driver accelerated and crashed through a barrier, and the truck exploded. The Safari Hotel collapsed, trapping many under its rubble, and the Qatari embassy was severely damaged.\n\nAccording to a Somali intelligence official investigating the attack, the truck was overloaded and covered with a tarpaulin. The dust on it aroused the suspicion of soldiers at a checkpoint just outside Mogadishu. The soldiers ordered the driver to park and get out, with the assailant calling a well-known man who vouched for the truck. After passing the checkpoint, the truck sped through another one where the soldiers fired at it and flattened one of its tires. The driver parked on a busy street and detonated it. A senior police official investigating it stated that it was packed with 2 tonnes (2.2 U.S. tons) of explosives.\n\nA Toyota Noah minivan loaded with explosives was also intercepted and stopped; it later detonated without casualties.\n\nOfficials said that the target of the attacks was the heavily guarded Mogadishu airport compound, where the United Nations, most embassies, and the headquarters of the 22,000-strong AMISOM, are based. The minivan was to blast open the Medina Gate entrance to the compound to allow the truck with more explosives to be driven in and detonated. The possibility of complicity of personnel manning vehicle checkpoints was being investigated, after claims the first truck was stopped at two checkpoints en route to Mogadishu without any cargo inspection.\n\nA second bombing occurred about 30 minutes later, less than 300 metres away, killing two people in the Medina district.\n\n== Victims ==\nAs of 4 March 2018, at least 587 people had been confirmed killed. The explosion took place on one of the busiest streets in Mogadishu; victims included senior civil servants, five paramedic volunteers, a journalist, an American-Somali man, a medical student and 15 children. The full death total may never be known with certainty, as the remains of many people would not be found due to the intense heat (which could be felt 100 metres away from the scene), and others were buried quickly by relatives following Islamic custom. Around 160 bodies could not be recognised, doctor Aden Nur said, and they were buried by the government the day after the bombing. Over a hundred injured were taken to the Madina hospital\u2014one of six overcrowded nearby hospitals.\n\n==Perpetrators==\nWhile no group has admitted responsibility, officials believe the attack was made by a cell of the group al-Shabaab, following statements made by a key member, a veteran militant who had taken part in previous attacks in Mogadishu, with investigators believing the attack may have been motivated out of desire for revenge for the botched United States-led raid on his hometown in August. He was arrested while driving a second explosives-packed vehicle into the city on the day of the explosion. An official said that the man had confessed, and was proud of what he had done, which he said was for jihad. Another official said that the bombs were hidden under rice, sugar and other goods in the truck. The driver was detained but a local businessman and tribal leader vouched for the truck. The official stated they were investigating whether the attackers had help from within the security forces. A Somali intelligence official stated that the man who vouched for the truck had been arrested.\n\nIn February 2018, a military court in Mogadishu sentenced two people to death for their role in the bombings. According to the court, Hassan Aden Isak was driving a truck intended to be used in a second bombing on the day. Ibrahim Hassan Absuge was sentenced in absentia for the bombings as well, and is also accused of masterminding the November 2016 Mogadishu car bombing, which killed 20 people.\n\n== Reactions ==\n===Domestic===\nThe Somali president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, declared three days of national mourning. He and hundreds of other Somali citizens donated blood. \"Today\u2019s horrific attack proves our enemy would stop (at) nothing to cause our people pain and suffering. Let\u2019s unite against terror,\" he said on Twitter. \"Time to unite and pray together. Terror won\u2019t win.\"\n\n===International===\nThe United States Department of State expressed condolences to victims and wished a quick recovery for the injured. It called the attack \"senseless and cowardly\" and said it would stand with Somalia against extremism.\n\n== See also ==\n* Mogadishu bombing (disambiguation), a list\n* 2017 timeline of the War in

{"title":"Sehwan suicide bombing","article":"On 16 February 2017, a suicide bombing took place inside the Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in Sehwan, Sindh, Pakistan, where pilgrims were performing a Sufi ritual after the evening prayers. At least 90 people were killed and over 300 injured.\n\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \u2013 Khorasan Province claimed responsibility for the bombing. Services at the shrine were resumed the next day in an act of defiance against terrorists, while leading Pakistani performers partook in the traditional Sufi whirling dance at the shrine a few days later as a protest against the radical Islamist perpetrators.\n\nThe attack followed a series of terrorist incidents earlier in the month, including a suicide attack in Lahore. Pakistani authorities alleged that the attacks were orchestrated by jihadists in Afghanistan.\n\n==Bombing==\nThe suicide bomber struck the pilgrims during a dhamaal (ritual dance) after the evening prayers. The bomber threw a grenade which failed to explode. Then he blew himself up inside the shrine hall under the dome, near its Golden Gate. The bomber, believed to be an Afghan national, had bypassed the security check at the shrine.\n\nAt least 21 children were believed to be among the dead. The bomber used a suicide jacket, with the ball bearings in the jacket acting as shrapnel and causing casualties.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe injured and deceased were immediately shifted to the Taluka Medical Hospital which was not equipped with a trauma centre to deal with emergency cases. The medical facilities in Sehwan were basic, and some of the injured were in critical condition. A state of emergency was declared for all hospitals in the neighbouring areas. Pakistan Navy helicopters and a Pakistan Air Force C-130 were dispatched for rescue operations.\n\nHours after the attack, law enforcement agencies launched a nationwide crackdown and search operation, during which over 100 militants were killed and scores arrested. Several insurgents were confronted in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Weapons, including hand grenades, were recovered from their hideouts. Police arrested a suspected facilitator in connection to the Sehwan attack from Johi, a town in Sindh's Dadu District.\nOn 22 February 2017, a few days after attack, Pakistan Military launched Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad to eliminate terrorism.\n\n===Resumption of daily services===\nThe next morning, the shrine's caretaker continued the daily tradition of ringing the shrine's bell at 3:30\u00a0am, and said that he would not be intimidated by terrorists. The shrine's dhamaal, or meditative dancing ceremony, resumed the evening following the attack. A few days later, several leading Pakistani artists and performers partook in a dhamaal at the shrine as a defiant response to radical Islamists.\n\n==Reactions==\n===Domestic===\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the blast, and said that \"an attack on the shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar is an attack on the progressive and inclusive future of Pakistan.\" A statement released by the military's Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) stated that the army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, had ordered that immediate assistance be provided to civil authorities. Bajwa said \"Each drop of the nation's blood shall be revenged, and revenged immediately. No more restraint for anyone.\"\n\nThe Governor of Sindh, Mohammad Zubair, condemned the blast and said \"Sindh is a land of the Sufis. The terrorists have targeted the devotees to achieve their nefarious designs.\" The Government of Sindh announced three days of mourning in Sindh, while the governments of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan also announced a day of mourning in their respective provinces.\n\n====Strikes on Afghan camps====\nISPR spokesman, Major General Asif Ghafoor, tweeted: \"Recent terrorist acts are being executed on directions from hostile powers and from sanctuaries in Afghanistan. We shall defend and respond\". A few hours after the incident, the Pakistan-Afghanistan border was sealed indefinitely for security reasons. On 17 February, the Pakistan Army summoned Afghan embassy officials to the General Headquarters and handed over a list of 76 insurgents hiding in Afghanistan. The army demanded that Kabul take \"immediate action\" or have them \"handed over to Pakistan\". The same day, army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa made a telephone call to the general commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, John W. Nicholson, and expressed concern over such incidents in Pakistan linked to safe havens in Afghanistan. Bajwa stated \"Such terrorist activities and inaction against them are testing our current policy of cross border restraint\" and urged Nicholson for cooperation in dismantling the militant networks, in addition to briefing him about the list of wanted terrorists. Later, Pakistani security forces destroyed a dozen Jamaat-ul-Ahrar camps across the border in eastern Afghanistan, and killed over a dozen militants including a top trainer of suicide bombers. The strikes were confirmed by Afghan sources, who said that several Pakistani artillery rounds had hit Nangarhar Province's Lal Pur District and that \"15 to 20 terrorists, among them Commander Rehman Baba, have been killed and many more injured.\" The Afghan foreign ministry also protested the shelling by Pakistan on its territory.\n\n===International===\n* : President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack, stating that \"terrorists once again, proved that they have no respect for Islamic values\". Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack and offered sympathy to the families of victims and people of Pakistan.\n* : Ambassador Andrei Ermolovich condemned the Sehwan blast while expressing solidarity with Pakistan. He also said that Belarus stands with Pakistan in its efforts for elimination of terrorism.\n* : President Xi Jinping condemned the attack and offered sympathy to the Pakistani people.

{"title":"2017 Saint Petersburg Metro bombing","article":"On 3 April 2017, a terrorist attack using an explosive device took place on the Saint Petersburg Metro between Sennaya Ploshchad and Tekhnologichesky Institut stations. Seven people (including the perpetrator) were initially reported to have died, and eight more died later from their injuries, bringing the total to 15.\n\nAt least 45 others were injured in the incident. The explosive device was contained in a briefcase. A second explosive device was found and defused at Ploshchad Vosstaniya metro station. The suspected perpetrator was named as Akbarzhon Jalilov, a Russian citizen who was an ethnic Uzbek born in Kyrgyzstan.\n\n==Background==\n\nIn 2016, ISIL had plotted to target St. Petersburg due to Russia's military involvement in Syria, resulting in arrests. No public transport system in Russia had been bombed since the 2010 Moscow Metro bombings.\n\nISIL propaganda was being circulated prior to this incident. It encouraged supporters to launch strikes on Moscow. ISIL propaganda showed bullet holes through Putin's head and a poster circulated before the attack of a falling Kremlin and included the message \"We Will Burn Russia.\" However, as some researchers have said, Russia faces a \"sophisticated and complex\"  threat from domestic terrorism, linked to many different groups.\n\nVladimir Putin was visiting Saint Petersburg, where he was born, on the day of the attack.\n\n==Attack==\n\nOn 3 April 2017, a device containing  of explosives detonated on a train travelling through a tunnel between the Sennaya Ploshchad and Tekhnologichesky Institut stations of the Saint Petersburg Metro. According to a statement from the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the bomb was detonated on the third carriage of the train. Eyewitnesses said the blast occurred near the door. Immediately after the explosion, smoke filled the platform. Video from social media showed multiple victims on the platform and a metal door twisted by the force of the blast. Following reports of the explosion, all metro stations in Saint Petersburg were quickly closed. In the late evening, metro services were resumed on Lines 3, 4, and 5.\n\nA second bomb was discovered and disarmed at Ploshchad Vosstaniya station. The device had ball bearings, screws, and shrapnel and was hidden within a fire extinguisher containing an equivalent of about  of TNT. Jalilov's DNA was found on a bag which contained the extinguisher, suggesting that he intentionally left this bag inside a carriage as witnessed by some passengers.\n\n==Aftermath==\nSecurity was heightened after the attack. Metal detectors, installed countrywide following another metro attack seven years before, were all implemented after not having been in use for several years. The Moscow Metro security department said they were ready to assist the Saint Petersburg Metro in case of any help being needed. Local media reported that authorities had found suspicious packages in three Moscow metro stations, Nagatinskaja, Savelovskaya and Ugrezhskaya (CIP). Authorities later cordoned off the area. The security of Pulkovo International Airport was also heightened in response to the blast. A possible suspect was sighted on Metro surveillance cameras, according to unconfirmed reports. The Investigative Committee of Russia said the train operator's decision to drive it to the next station helped to avoid an even higher number of casualties.\n\nTwo weeks later, FSB released a statement says that Russian security operatives have detained Abror Azimov (born 1990), the alleged mastermind of the bombing, in Moscow in which he trained the suicide attacker.\n\n==Casualties==\nAs reported by the Russian Ministry of Health, approximately 50 people were injured, of whom 15 died (seven during the attack, eight later from their injuries). 39 people were hospitalised, of whom six had critical injuries. Children were among those injured.\n\nThe fifteen people killed were identified as thirteen Russian citizens, a Kazakh man and an Azerbaijani woman.\n\n==Perpetrator==\nThe suspected perpetrator behind the attacks was identified by Kyrgyzstan and Russian intelligence services as Akbarzhon Jalilov (sometimes spelled Akbarjon Djalilov), an ethnic Uzbek 22-year-old Kyrgyz-born Russian citizen. He was one of the 15 people who died during the attack.\n\nJalilov was born in 1995 in Osh, Kyrgyzstan, and arrived in Moscow around 2011. According to Russian newspaper Moskovskij Komsomolets, Gazeta.ru reported he had worked as a cook at a sushi bar in 2015, while other sources claimed Jalilov had worked in a garage before disappearing weeks prior to the attack. Interfax said authorities believe he had ties to radical Islamic groups. Russian media has reported that he traveled to Syria in 2014 and trained with Islamic State militants. On 26 April, a group called the Imam Shamil Battalion has claimed responsibility the attack, and said that the bomber was acting on orders from al-Qaeda. The statement, posted by SITE Intelligence Group, said the bomber, Akbarzhon Jalilov, had acted on instructions from al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. In considering the incident, researchers had already illustrated that \u2018analysis should not focus exclusively on recent developments and Daesh\u2019, but rather look at the \u2018broader context\u2019 including the \u2018range of groups with which Central Asian radicals are involved.\u2019\n\n===Initial reports===\nOn 3 April 2017, investigators said they believed the attack was a suicide bombing and identified a Central Asian as the suspected perpetrator. Some reports initially misidentified the suspect as a 22-year-old from Kazakhstan who was an IT student at St. Petersburg State University of Economics. He had been reported missing. This individual was later correctly identified as a victim of the attack. The suspect was later identified as a 23-year-old native of Kyrgyzstan with Russian citizenship and with links to international militant groups. The man with a beard wearing a skullcap contacted police to clear his name. Interfax later said only one person was involved. The man with the beard turned out to be a former paratrooper from Bashkortostan.\n\n==Reactions==\n===Domestic===\nPresident Vladimir Putin was in the city when the attack happened and pledged a thorough investigation. During an unrelated meeting with President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko, Putin said they are \"considering all possible causes, including terrorism.\" He later visited the area of the attack, which was prohibited by the Federal Protective Service due to security concerns. This information was later denied by RIA Novosti. His statement was followed by Lukashenko expressing his sadness over the bombing. Mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin expressed his condolences to the victims of the attack and ordered the strengthening of security measures around the capital's transport infrastructure, according to the Mayor's and city government's Press Secretary Gulnara Penkova. Head of the Ministry of Health Veronika Skvortsova instructed federal doctors to help doctors in St. Petersburg to assist the victims.\n\nThe Head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov called for the identification and punishment of the perpetrators.\n\nThe All-Russian Union of Insurers said relatives of the victims will be able to receive 2.025\u00a0million rubles.\n\nA makeshift memorial was made to honour the victims of the bombing. Saint Petersburg declared three days of mourning in response to the attack. Mayor Georgi Poltavchenko, Governor of Leningrad Alexander Drozdenko, and President Vladimir Putin visited the site and laid flowers to pay respect.\n\n===International===\nCondolences and sympathies for those affected were offered by several international figures, including representatives of \nAlgeria, \nChina, the Czech Republic, Norway, \nDenmark, \nFinland, \nFrance, Georgia, \nHungary, \nIndia, \nIndonesia, \nIran, \nIsrael, \nJapan, \nLaos, \nMalaysia, Pakistan, Poland, \nPortugal, \nSingapore, \nThailand, Ukraine, \nthe United Kingdom, \nthe United States, \nVietnam, \nNATO, \nand the European Union.\n\nUkraine tightened security around its metro stations in fear of an attack.\n\n=== Other reactions ===\nTel Aviv city hall building was lit with the colours of the Russian flag. In Brussels, where a similar attack took place a year earlier, the ING Marnix building near the Throne metro station was also decorated with a moving Russian flag animation. At midnight (01:00 of April 5 in Moscow time), the lights of the Eiffel Tower were switched off to honor the victims.\n\nThe Independent reported that some supporters of ISIL on unnamed internet forums linked the attack to Russia's support of Bashar al-Assad, and shared photos and video of people injured and killed by the blast.\n\n\nSaint-P\u00e9tersbourg - M\u00e9tro - Technologichesky

{"title":"2017 Charsadda suicide bombing","article":"On 21 February 2017, suicide bombers targeted a sessions court in Tangi, Charsadda District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. At least seven people were killed, including a lawyer and more than 20 others injured. Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan faction Jamaat-ul-Ahrar claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\n==Bombing==\nThe explosions took place at the entrance of the sessions court. Three suicide attackers were involved in the attack. The attackers were neutralized after a 20-minute gun battle with security personnel. The three attackers also hurled six grenades. Four judges and around 40 lawyers were present within the premises of the court when bombers attacked the judicial complex.\nAccording to DIG Mardan, each bomber carried seven kilograms of explosives in his suicide vest. Later, a CCTV footage available with media showed the alleged suicide bombers of the attack.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAbout 10 ambulances were dispatched to Tangi from Peshawar, where the Lady Reading Hospital had been put on high alert. The injured were taken to Tehsil Headquarters Hospital while the critically injured were later shifted to Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar. The body parts of the suicide bombers were sent to Lahore for identification.\n\nOn 22 February 2017, security forces claimed to have arrested three facilitators of the suicide bombers. They were shifted to an undisclosed location for interrogation. The Inspector General of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police claimed that the suicide bombers had come from Afghanistan through Mohmand Agency.\n\nOn 23 February 2017, at least three gunmen attacked the NADRA office in Charsadda. The attack was foiled when police returned fire forcing the attackers to flee. Following the attack, two motorcycles of the attackers were taken into possession. The area was then cordoned off and a search operation was initiated.\n\n==Reactions==\nOn 22 February 2017, in response to the Operation Ghazi, Pakistan Army launched Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad (literally meaning elimination of discord) across the country. The operation aimed at indiscriminately eliminating residual threat of terrorism and consolidating gains of operations made so far. It further aimed at ensuring security of the borders. The countrywide de-weaponisation and explosive control were laid as the additional objectives of the operation.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif strongly condemned the attack and expressed grief over the loss of lives while praying for the victims. He praised the role of law enforcing agencies which prevented the attack while resolving to \"continue to fight against terrorist elements\".

The group has been active in Afghanistan since 1976 and as of 2018 has programs active in sixteen of the country's thirty-four provinces. Charity groups like Save the Children are frequent targets for militant groups in Afghanistan. For example, in May 2017 a Swedish NGO in Kabul, Operation Mercy, was the target of an attack that left two people dead, and in 2010, ten members of an international eye care team were shot and killed by Taliban militants in the country's Nuristan Province.\n\n==Attack==\n\nShortly after 9:00am local time on 24 January 2018, a suicide bomber in a car detonated his explosives at the front of the Save the Children compound. The blast was followed up by at least four armed militants attempting to storm the building, according to witnesses some of the attackers were wearing Afghan police uniforms. A firefight broke out between Afghan security forces and the attackers that lasted more than eight hours. 45 people in the compound had to be rescued by commandos. All the attackers were killed and six civilians, including three Save the Children employees, were killed with at least 27 people, including three Afghan troops, injured. \n\n==Responsibility==\n\nThe Taliban denied responsibility for the attack. ISIL claimed responsibility, saying it was targeting Western institutions.

{"title":"March 2018 Kabul suicide bombing","article":"A suicide bombing occurred on 21 March 2018 around 12:00 PM (7:30 AM UTC) in Kabul near Kart-e Sakhi, a Shia shrine. At least 33 people were killed with more than 65 wounded in the bombing. The militant group ISIL claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\n==Attack==\nKabul had been on alert for attacks during Nowruz, the Persian New Year. The attack took place at the Sakhi shrine, a frequented location during the occasion. The shrine has been the target of previous attacks; in October 2016, 14 people were killed during the festival of Ashura, and 11 people had been killed in a bombing in 2011. A spokesperson for the Afghan Ministry of the Interior stated that the attacker approached the shrine on foot who was then prevented from getting closer to the shrine due to police checkpoints and when he was identified by the police, he detonated the explosives he was carrying among a group of passersby. At least 33 people were killed in the bombing, while injuring more than 65, according to a statement from a spokesperson for the Ministry for Public Health.\n\n===Perpetrators===\nThe Amaq News Agency, the unofficial mouthpiece of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), claimed responsibility for the attack on behalf of the group, saying that the attacks specifically targeted Shiites celebrating Nowruz. ISIL has repeatedly targeted Shia Muslims, who form a minority of 15% in Afghanistan, over the past few years.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe spokesman for Kabul's police force said that an investigation had been launched into the bombing. Survivors claimed about 20 were lightly injured as well.\n\n===Reactions===\nShortly after the attack, Afghanistan\u2019s National Security Advisor Hanif Atmar was interviewed about the country\u2019s strategy to combat extremism by German broadcaster Deutsche Welle, who condemned the attack and highlighted that the West and the country share \"a common threat\". The Indian Ministry of External Affairs condemned the \"inhumane and barbaric\" attack, and offered to provide any required assistance to Afghanistan. Tadamichi Yamamoto, UN Secretary-General\u2019s Special Representative for Afghanistan and head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan strongly condemned the suicide bombing and called the attacks \"unjustifiable\".

{"title":"Kabul ambulance bombing","article":"On 27 January 2018, an ambulance was used as a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device near Sidarat Square in Kabul, Afghanistan. At least 103 people were killed and 235 others wounded in the attack. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\n==Attack==\nOn 27 January 2018, attackers blew up an explosives-packed ambulance near an interior ministry building on a busy and heavily-guarded street in Kabul during rush hour. The bombers detonated the explosives while passing through the second in a series of checkpoints near Kabul's embassies and government buildings including the European Union embassies. The explosion was so powerful that the shock was felt around the capital, collapsing buildings and destroying fa\u00e7ades in the immediate area. The Jamhuriat Hospital, government offices, businesses and a school are close to the site of the blast. It was the third major attack in seven days, following shootings at an aid agency in Jalalabad and at the Inter-Continental Hotel in Kabul.\n\nA bomb was hidden in an ambulance and detonated at a second police checkpoint, according to officials. Its blast also destroyed vehicles, shops, and buildings nearby.\n\nThe attack occurred on a street, locally known as Chicken Street, near a building run by the Interior Ministry. Various government agencies have offices there and the road had security checkpoints in place. The coordinator for the Italian aid group Emergency that operates a trauma center described the event as a \"massacre\". According to reports, the vehicle was stopped at a second security checkpoint after passing the primary one claiming they had a patient. When police attempted to stop the vehicle from going further, the driver detonated the bomb. Relatives were reported to be queuing at the city morgue. The scene of the attack was described as one of carnage with shattered bodies, many unidentifiable, lying all over.\n\n=== Perpetrators ===\nThe Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. The Afghan government described it as a crime against humanity, and accused Pakistan for providing support to the attackers. Pakistan denies supporting militants carrying out attacks in Afghanistan.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe third major attack in Afghanistan within a week, President Ashraf Ghani again blamed Pakistan for failing to move against Taliban terrorists. Ghani vowed revenge against the Taliban in retaliation. In addition, Ghani sent an Afghan intelligence delegation to Pakistan to hand over \"undeniable\" evidence that the terrorists of the bombing were planning the attack within Pakistan. Peace prospects with the Taliban also took a downward turn following increasing outrage over the attacks, with a presidential spokesman saying that the Taliban \"has lost the opportunity for peace talks\". The use of an ambulance to deliver the bomb was described as an act of perfidy by the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/asia\/kabul-bomb-ambulance-afghanistan-death-toll-explosion-taliban-blast-a8181856.html","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-42843897","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/01\/27\/world\/asia\/afghanistan-kabul-attack.html","https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2018\/01\/27\/581265342\/dozens-killed-more-than-100-wounded-in-taliban-car-bombing-in-kabul","http:\/\/www.zeit.de\/gesellschaft\/zeitgeschehen\/2018-01\/afghanistan-kabul-explosion-rettungskraefte-einsatz","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-afghanistan-blast\/blast-hits-afghan-capital-kabul-reuters-witnesses-idUSKBN1FG086","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/suicide-blast-in-central-kabul-kills-at-least-10-wounds-scores-officials-say\/2018\/01\/27\/4a30fcb6-0344-11e8-9d31-d72cf78dbeee_story.html","https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/world\/2018\/01\/27\/afghanistan-kabul-car-bombing-attack-ta\/1071751001\/","http:\/\/www.tolonews.com\/afghanistan\/death-toll-rises-95-kabul-ambulance-bombing","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2018\/jan\/27\/scores-of-people-wounded-and-several-killed-in-kabul-blast","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-asia-42843897","http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/world\/2018\/jan\/29\/ashraf-ghani-warns-taliban-of-revenge-for-kabul-attacks-1765219.html","https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/news\/defence\/afghan-president-speaks-to-modi-not-to-pakistan-pm\/articleshow\/62724174.cms","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180203064049\/https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/news\/defence\/afghan-president-speaks-to-modi-not-to-pakistan-pm\/articleshow\/62724174.cms","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/afghan-peace-prospects-dim-as-outrage-grows-over-taliban-violence\/2018\/01\/30\/8ef3507c-05da-11e8-aa61-f3391373867e_story.html","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2018\/jan\/27\/scores-of-people-wounded-and-several-killed-in-kabul-blast"]}

{"title":"2018 As-Suwayda attacks","article":"The 2018 As-Suwayda attacks were a string of suicide bombings and gun attacks that took place in and around As-Suwayda, Syria on 25 July, killing at least 258 people and injuring 180 others. The attacks were committed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and largely targeted Syria's Druze minority.\n\n==Attacks==\nThe attackers began by assaulting defensive positions in the city. When they depleted their ammunition, they detonated their explosive vests. The Syrian Arab News Agency reported two separate suicide attacks in Suweida, with security forces killing two other attackers before they could blow themselves up, and arresting another inside Suwaida General Hospital. Groups of militants also attacked areas in the Al-Mushannaf nahiyah in a coordinated assault and four villages ( Al-Sbeky , Ramy , Ghethet-Hamael and Tarbeh ), gaining temporary control of several settlements, slaughtered families in their houses and seizing hostages. Local people gathered and defended their villages with simple weapons and  retook the villages without support of governmental forces . A substantial number of Druze militias were involved in driving the ISIL forces back, most notably the Rijal al-Karama movement and the Mountain Brigade, one of whose sub-commanders (Sheikh Abu Mu'annis Nabil Saymu'a) was killed in course of the fighting. The Christian SSNP also aided the local pro-government defenders, while the Syrian Army only arrived in the area after the combat had already ended two days later.\n\nA suicide bombing in a vegetable market in the capital of the province, Al Suwayda, resulted in at least 38 casualties. Following the attack, three captured ISIL fighters were publicly hanged by the angry local Druze people in the provincial capital.\n\n==Casualties==\nInitially, the head of the Sweida health authority told the pro-Damascus Sham FM radio some 96 people were killed and 176 wounded in total. Later, the director of health updated the number of deaths and injuries and said that 215 people were killed and 180 others injured in the attacks. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported 258 deaths (142 civilians and 116 government fighters), in addition to 63 ISIL fighters. Also, between 14-20 and 36 Druze women and children were abducted by ISIL fighters during the raid, and taken to their holdouts in the desert. Afterward some managed to escape while several died in captivity. ISIL executed all the Druze men they've captured. ISIL executed several Syrian army soldiers and NDF members captured during the raid, posting videos of their executions on the Internet. ISIL had threatened to execute the captured Druze women if the Syrian army didn't stop their offensive against ISIL in the Yarmouk basin in western Daraa province.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n\nAs-Suwayda Governor Amer al-Eshi reported that the city had been secured by evening. The state-run television station, Ikhbariyah TV, reported that the Syrian Air Force has launched a bombing campaign on ISIS-held villages of al-Matouna, Duma, and Tima. On the 31st of July 2018, in exchange for the release of the Druze women captured by ISIL in the raid in eastern Suweida, the Syrian Army evacuated hundreds of ISIL fighters from the Yarmouk basin in western Daraa to their strongholds in the Badiya region in eastern Syria Desert.\nMany Druze people were very angry with the Syrian Military because of the incompetent security measures in Suwayda province, accusing the Syrian Government of deliberately allowing the attacks so that they can have a casus belli to reimpose stricter government control over the Suwayda province and end the Druze autonomy, especially because the attack was made by ISIL fighters evacuated from Southern Damascus to Eastern Syria Desert in May 2018.\n\nAfterwards, the Syrian government offered a deal to ISIL, that the 30+ captured Druze civilians will be swapped in the prisoner exchange for over 200 ISIL fighters of Jaysh Khaled bin Walid who surrendered in southwestern Daraa on 31 July 2018, however ISIL forces in Badiya region refused the prisoner exchange, and instead requested a large sum of ransom money for the release of the captured Druze civilians, which the Syrian army refused to pay. In order to pressure the Syrian government to pay the ransom, ISIL executed one of the male Druze civilians captured in the raid on August 2, and posted the video of his execution on the internet. In response, the Syrian army threatened ISIL forces in Badiya region that if they did not release the captives, that they would be destroyed in the upcoming military operation in Badiya al Sham region.\nIt was reported from local residents that the defense forces belonging to Al-Baath Party removed its defensive medium-sized weapons four days before the attack despite knowing the imminent threats.\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n* : Saad el Gamal, chairman of the Committee for Arab Affairs in the Egyptian Parliament, condemned the attacks while suggesting that foreign interference in Syrian internal affairs \"offers a cover for terrorists\".\n* : The YPG released a statement on August 4 condemning the attacks and calling for further actions against IS: \"The attack reveals once again the true face of IS and shows clearly that this terrorist group must be destroyed as soon as possible\".\n\n==See also==\n* 2018 Southern Syria offensive\n* Timeline of the Syrian Civil War (May-August 2018)\n* As-Suwayda offensive (June 2018)\n* As-Suwayda offensive (August 2018)\n* Inghimasi\n\n== References ==","urls":["https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-middle-east-44949823","https:\/\/aawsat.com\/english\/home\/article\/1343806\/isis-commits-massacre-syria%E2%80%99s-sweida-toll-rises","https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/07\/25\/middleeast\/syria-bombing-intl\/index.html","http:\/\/www.aymennjawad.org\/2018\/05\/the-suwayda-attacks-interview","https:\/\/aoav.org.uk\/2018\/suicide-bomber-kills-at-least-38-in-syria-city-of-sweida\/<\/ref>","https:\/\/www.almasdarnews.com\/article\/isis-executes-captured-syrian-soldiers-after-devastating-terrorist-attack-in-sweida\/<\/ref>","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-syria-attack\/deadly-attacks-hit-syrian-villages-city-of-sweida-idUSKBN1KF0DG","http:\/\/www.xinhuanet.com\/english\/2018-07\/26\/c_137348276.htm","http:\/\/www.syriahr.com\/en\/?p=99288","http:\/\/www.syriahr.com\/en\/?p=99317","https:\/\/news.mb.com.ph\/2018\/07\/27\/is-leaves-syria-druze-reeling-from-heaviest-losses-of-war\/","http:\/\/www.dailystar.com.lb\/News\/Middle-East\/2018\/Jul-30\/458410-36-women-children-kidnapped-by-daesh-last-week-in-syrias-swaida-activist-group.ashx<\/ref>","https:\/\/www.mideastcenter.org\/research-blog\/new-details-of-isis-attack-on-suwayda-the-hundreds-killed-14-druze-women-kidnapped<\/ref>","https:\/\/www.almasdarnews.com\/article\/video-isis-threatens-to-slaughter-women-captives-unless-army-halts-west-daraa-offensive\/<\/ref>","https:\/\/www.almasdarnews.com\/article\/isis-threatens-to-burn-alive-women-children-kidnapped-from-al-sweida\/<\/ref>","https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/middle-east\/syria-suicide-bomb-attack-isis-sweida-deraa-golan-heights-a8462916.html","https:\/\/syria.liveuamap.icom\/en\/2018\/31-july-multiple-sources-and-witnesses-reporting-100s-of","https:\/\/www.almasdarnews.com\/article\/defeated-isis-in-yarmouk-basin-evacuated-to-syrian-desert-photos\/<\/ref>","https:\/\/www.almasdarnews.com\/article\/syrian-military-to-isis-release-sweida-prisoners-or-we-will-destroy-you\/<\/ref>","https:\/\/www.almasdarnews.com\/article\/isis-releases-footage-of-19-year-old-student-executed-in-al-sweida\/<\/ref>","https:\/\/www.almasdarnews.com\/article\/isis-executes-first-hostage-from-al-sweida\/<\/ref>","https:\/\/www.almasdarnews.com\/article\/syrian-armys-elite-unit-heads-to-sweida-to-finish-off-isis\/<\/ref>","http:\/\/www.egyptiangazette.net.eg\/egypt-news\/7241-parl-t-committee-slams-terrorist-attack-on-syria-s-as-suwayda.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180727182453\/http:\/\/www.egyptiangazette.net.eg\/egypt-news\/7241-parl-t-committee-slams-terrorist-attack-on-syria-s-as-suwayda.html","https:\/\/anfenglish.com\/rojava\/ypg-condemns-the-brutal-attack-on-the-people-of-suwayda-28750"]}
{"title":"2018 Peshawar suicide bombing","article":"On 10 July 2018, a suicide bombing occurred at the Awami National Party's workers rally in Yaka Toot area of Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Haroon Bilour, ANP's candidate for PK-78 and prime target of the attack, was killed as a result of the bombing. The attack left 22 people dead and wounded 75 others. Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Attacks against ANP leaders ===\nThe leaders of Awami National Party (ANP) have frequently been ambushed by militants. In December 2012, Bashir Ahmad Bilour, leader of ANP and Haroon Bilour's father, was killed by a suicide bomber.\n\n=== Motive ===\n\nThe motive behind the assault was to kill the ANP leader Haroon Bilour. Bilour was to contest the next elections from PK-78. On 16 April 2013, a suicide attack claimed by Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on ANP election rally that targeted Haroon Bilour, killed 15 people. However, Haroon Bilour was not at the rally.\n\n== Bombing ==\nOn late night 10 July 2018, Haroon Bilour arrived at Yakatoot area in Peshawar where ANP workers had gathered for a corner meeting. As his vehicle arrived, a loud explosion occurred. Bilour suffered serious injuries and was shifted to hospital where he succumbed to his wounds.\n\n==  Aftermath ==\n\n=== Rescue services ===\n\nSoon after the explosion, the Law enforcement agencies reached the site and initiated investigation. Peshawar's CCPO Qazi Jameel said that nearly 8 kilograms of TNT was used in the bomb.  All the deceased and injured were shifted to Lady Reading Hospital. AIG KPK Shafqat Malik said that a suicide bomber blew himself up and Haroon was the target of the attack.

On 12 July 2018, two days after the attack, another person succumbed to his injuries, bringing the number of deaths to 22.\n\n=== Bilour's remains  ===\nBilour's body was shifted to his residence at Bilour House. ANP supporters gathered outside his residence and shouted slogans against government for his \"failure to provide security\".\n\n=== PK-78 elections delay ===\nFollowing the incident, the Election Commission of Pakistan postponed the polls for PK-78, constituency from which Bilour was to contest election.\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n=== Security forces ===\nIG KPK Mohammad Tahir formed a seven-member team to probe the incident and directed it to submit report within 7 days. The following day, police conducted raids across the city. Nine units of Police and Quick Reaction Forces (QRF) were deployed at all entry and exit points of the city.\n\n=== Perpetrators ===\nTehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the bombing calling the assassination of Bilour \"a revenge of previous government\" (referring to 2008-2013 tenure of ANP's KPK governance) and also warned the security forces of more attacks.\n\n== Notable victims ==\n* Haroon Bilour, former Pakistani politician\n\n== References ==\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLady Reading Hospital.","urls":["http:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/article-80856-Bashir-Ahmed-Bilour-laid-to-rest-","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20121223124438\/http:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/article-80856-Bashir-Ahmed-Bilour-laid-to-rest-","https:\/\/tribune.com.pk\/story\/1754896\/1-anps-haroon-bilour-19-others-martyred-peshawar-blast\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180711132903\/https:\/\/tribune.com.pk\/story\/1754896\/1-anps-haroon-bilour-19-others-martyred-peshawar-blast\/","https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/803116","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180711132903\/https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/803116","https:\/\/www.geo.tv\/latest\/202734-anp-candidate-haroon-bilour-among-12-martyred-in-peshawar-suicide-blast","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180710214702\/https:\/\/www.geo.tv\/latest\/202734-anp-candidate-haroon-bilour-among-12-martyred-in-peshawar-suicide-blast","https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1419202","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180710214433\/https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1419202","https:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/latest\/340021-anps-haroor-bilour-among-several-injured-in-peshawar-blast","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180710200243\/https:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/latest\/340021-anps-haroor-bilour-among-several-injured-in-peshawar-blast","https:\/\/www.samaa.tv\/news\/2018\/07\/election-on-peshawar-seat-delayed-after-suicide-blast-kills-anp-leader\/","https:\/\/tribune.com.pk\/story\/1754896\/1-anps-haroon-bilour-19-others-martyred-peshawar-blast\/","https:\/\/arynews.tv\/en\/peshawar-suicide-blast-death-toll-21\/","https:\/\/www.geo.tv\/latest\/202734-anp-candidate-haroon-bilour-among-12-martyred-in-peshawar-suicide-blast","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180710214702\/https:\/\/www.geo.tv\/latest\/202734-anp-candidate-haroon-bilour-among-12-martyred-in-peshawar-suicide-blast","https:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/print\/341075-death-toll-from-suicide-bombing-reaches-22","https:\/\/tribune.com.pk\/story\/1754896\/1-anps-haroon-bilour-19-others-martyred-peshawar-blast\/","https:\/\/en.dailypakistan.com.pk\/pakistan\/ecp-delays-election-for-pk-78-after-haroon-bilours-martyrdom\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180711091754\/https:\/\/en.dailypakistan.com.pk\/pakistan\/ecp-delays-election-for-pk-78-after-haroon-bilours-martyrdom\/","https:\/\/tribune.com.pk\/story\/1755050\/1-high-level-investigation-team-formed-probe-peshawar-blast\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180711132903\/https:\/\/tribune.com.pk\/story\/1755050\/1-high-level-investigation-team-formed-probe-peshawar-blast\/"]}
{"title":"2018 Mastung and Bannu bombings","article":"On 13 July 2018, ahead of Pakistan's general election, two bombings took place at election rallies in Bannu and Mastung.\n\nIn Bannu, a remotely exploded bomb planted in a motorcycle left 5 people dead and 37 others wounded in an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Akram Khan Durrani. Ittehad-ul-Mujahideen, an extremist organization, claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nIn Mastung, a suicide bomber blew himself up during a rally for the Balochistan Awami Party's Siraj Raisani, the brother of former Balochistan chief minister Aslam Raisani. One of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Pakistani history, it killed 149 people and wounded 186 others. Siraj was taken to hospital in critical condition and died of injuries. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the event and named the suicide bomber as Abu Bakar al-Pakistani, though authorities identified him as Hafeez Nawaz of Abbottabad.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Pre-election violence ===\nThe attacks came 12 days before general elections. In the beginning of the month, a bombing took place in Ramzak Tehsil of North Waziristan at the office of Malik Aurangjeb Khan, Pakistan Movement of Justice's candidate for NA-48 (Tribal Area-IX), leaving 10 people injured. A week before the current attack in Bannu, a bomb planted in a motorcycle was remotely exploded at an election campaign of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal's PK\u201389 candidate Shein Malik in the Takhti Khel area of the city. Two days prior to the attacks, a suicide bombing at an election rally of the Awami National Party's leader Haroon Bilour in Peshawar left 20 people, including Bilour, dead and wounded 63 others. On 12 July, the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP)'s office in Khuzdar came under gunfire before a bomb detonated injuring 2 people.\n\n=== ISIL in Pakistan ===\n\nAfter the group's defeat in Iraq and Syria, many commanders of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) fled to other countries where resistance was weak. Many fighters headed to Afghanistan where Al-Qaeda was fighting against the United States. Since ISIL's entry intervention in Pakistan, Balochistan has been a focus of its militancy. In 2016, ISIL claimed responsibility for two attacks in Quetta; one in August and the other in October. The following year, it perpetrated a suicide bombing at a shrine in Sehwan. In Mastung that year, the group carried out a suicide bombing to assassinate Deputy Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan Abdul Ghafoor Haideri.\n\n== Prior intelligence ==\nSoon after the Peshawar ambush, National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA) forwarded 12 threats to federal and provincial interior ministries, following which committee chairman Rahman Malik directed authorities to enhance security of politicians named by NACTA. In its report, NACTA named six politicians that can be targeted. The list included Durrani. The other five politicians included Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)'s chairman Imran Khan, Awami National Party leaders Asfandyar Wali and Ameer Haider Khan Hoti, Qaumi Watan Party's head Aftab Sherpao and Hafiz Saeed's son Talha Saeed. It also suggested that members of PML-N and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) were under threat.\n\n== Prime targets ==\n\n=== Mastung ===\nSiraj Raisani was a prominent member of the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) and was to contest the next elections from PB-35. The brother of former Chief Minister of Balochistan Aslam Raisani, Siraj has served as chairman of Muttahida Mahaz Balochistan (MMB), founded by his father. He merged MMB into the BAP on 3 June 2018. Earlier, in July 2011, Raisani had survived an assassination attempt after grenades were thrown at him. In the ambush, his son Hakmal Raisani was killed.\n\n=== Bannu ===\nAkram Khan Durrani has served as chief minister of KPK from 2002 to 2007 and is contesting 2018 elections from NA-35 (Bannu) against Chairman of Pakistan Movement of Justice Imran Khan. Leader of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, Durrani was appointed as Minister for Housing & Works by the President of Pakistan Mamnoon Hussain on the advice of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on 29 August 2013. The current attack follows two previous unsuccessful attempts to assassinate him, one in 2015 and another in 2007.\n\n== Attacks ==\n\n=== Mastung ===\nSiraj Raisani was about to address an election rally when a suicide bomber, carrying around 16\u201320\u00a0kg of explosive material in his vest, blew himself up among a crowd of more than 1000 people. Along with Raisani, the explosion killed 128 people. Two days after the attack, on 15 July 2018, the number of dead increased to 149, while 186 other people were injured, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in Pakistan since the APS massacre in Peshawar in 2014.\n\n=== Bannu ===\nFormer KPK chief minister and Jamiat Ulema-e Islam (F) leader, Akram Khan Durrani was coming from an election rally. Due to death threats to Durrani, his security was increased and 40 policemen were deployed in his convoy. When the convoy came near Haved Bazaar, an IED, planted in a motorcycle, exploded near the tire of his vehicle. Durrani remained unhurt. Having taken place 40 meters away from JUI (F)'s rally site, the explosion left 5 people dead and wounded 37 others. There were conflicting views about the nature of the detonation. An eyewitness reported having watched a motorcycle rider blowing himself up, while officials said that the bomb was planted in a motorcycle. RPO Bannu called it a remotely exploded bomb.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n=== Rescue services ===\nBefore arrival of rescue teams, people took the injured to hospital via cabs. The ambulances brought survivors to Quetta Civil hospital where a state of emergency was imposed by provincial government. 73 bodies were first transported to the hospital. Later Shamim Akhtar, a hospital official, stated that they were treating 110 victims brought to them. Secretary of Sindh Blood Transfusion Authority (SBTA) Zahid Ansari asked blood banks to provide 1000 blood bags for the victims of the Mastung blast. Ansari was approached by Balochistan Health Department, and urged citizens of Karachi to donate blood, following which mobile messages asking for blood donation started circulating in Karachi. On 14 July 2018, Quetta civil hospital overflowed due to the excess of patients. Beds in the hospital fell short of need and many patients were treated in the corridor of hospital.\n\n=== Investigations and security measures ===\nOn the next day of attacks, a First Information Report (FIR) was registered against the Bannu bombing at the Haved police station. The FIR included charges of terrorism. Caretaker Chief Minister of KPK, Dost Muhammad Khan, formed a seven-member Joint Investigation Team (JIT) to probe the Bannu bombing and apprehend the assailants. 86 teams of Frontier Constabulary containing 3338 security personnel were positioned across the province and another 500 officers from Azad Kashmir were summoned to be deployed in the region.\n\nEarlier, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) sought a briefing from NACTA over the Bannu bombing and also sought a report from the caretaker CM, IG and chief secretary of KPK over inadequate security of politicians. After Mastung incident, ECP ordered NACTA's coordinator to appear before it on the following day. ECP declared 17,000 polling stations across the country as sensitive. These included 5,487 from Punjab, 5,878 from Sindh, 3,874 in KPK and 1,768 in Balochistan.\n\n== Arrests ==\nOn next day of attack, security forces detained two suspects. According to security forces, the suicide bomber, who blew himself up in Mastung, came from Afghanistan two days prior to the attack and stayed in Chaghi. The apprehended duo is suspected to have sheltered the assailant inside their residence. On 19 July, IG Balochistan Mohsin Hassan Butt said the suicide bomber named Hafiz Nawaz was resident of Abbottabad. Nawaz had traveled from Abbottabad to Sindh and therein affiliated with Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ). According to Butt, efforts were underway to arrest Mufti Haider, a facilitator of Nawaz.\n\n== Media coverage ==\nOn the day of attacks, former Pakistani Prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz arrived in Lahore from Abu Dhabi. The duo's arrival was more in the crosshairs of the Pakistani media, hence it was covered in more detail than the bombings. Initially only a few news channels gave it short coverage but later when the death toll exceeded 100, media started covering it broadly. Many people took to Twitter and criticized the media for sidelining coverage of the bombings. Geo News's journalist Hamid Mir said if these attacks were carried out in Punjab, they would have received much more media coverage.\n\n== Responsibility ==\nIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the Mastung bombing. Two days later, ISIL released picture of the suicide bomber and identified him as Abu Bakar al-Pakistani. In a series of statements released on its official news agency Amaq, the organization, referring to Raisani, stated that deceased included one of the Pakistani intelligence officers who was contesting elections. A group called Ittehad-ul-Mujahideen claimed responsibility for the Bannu incident.\n\n== Domestic reactions ==\n\n=== Government ===\nCaretaker Prime minister of Pakistan Nasirul Mulk condemned the attack and directed the interior ministry to issue a notification declaring Sunday, a day of mourning. Accompanied by Chairman senate Sadiq Sanjrani and caretaker Chief Minister of Balochistan Alauddin Marri, Mulk arrived in Quetta two days after the bombing and condoled the victims in hospital. He also met with Raisani's family and expressed his grief. Interim chief minister of Punjab, Hassan Askari condemned the attack and said that no religion asks for violence against innocent people and that the entire nation was united against terrorism. Marri expressed his grief over loss of lives. Denouncing the massacre, he called it \"a conspiracy to derail elections\". He also vowed to beat terror by education. The acting government of Balochistan announced two days of mourning in the province. The national flag was raised at half-mast throughout the province. The caretaker chief minister of Sindh Fazalur Rehman condemned the attack and expressed sorrow over loss of lives. Interim chief minister of KPK Dost Muhammad Khan prayed for injures and expressed sympathies for bereaved families. Denouncing the bombings, he vowed that perpetrators'd be dealt with iron hand. KPK Governor Iqbal Zafar Jhagra denounced both the attacks and prayed for the victims. On 16 July, the senate passed a unanimous resolution condemning the Mastung bombing and expressed grief over loss of lives.\n\n=== Politicians ===\nChairman of Pakistan Peoples Party Bilawal Zardari denounced the attacks. He also said that these assaults shouldn't delay elections. Former President Asif Ali Zardari condemned both attacks and expressed his \"profound grief\" over loss of lives. Chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Imran Khan visited Quetta to express his grief. He criticized authorities for lack of implementation of National Action Plan. In a tweet he said he wondered why terrorism rises in the country whenever Nawaz Sharif is in trouble.

In one of his statements, he said that India was involved in Mastung suicide blast.

{"title":"2019 Qalat bombing","article":"On 19 September 2019, a suicide car bombing occurred outside a hospital in Qalati Ghilji, Zabul Province, Afghanistan. At least 20 people were estimated to be killed and over 90 others injured. By 20 September the death toll had risen to 39, with most of the victims being doctors and patients. More than 140 people were also injured in the attack, although the true number is believed to be higher. The Taliban later claimed that they meant to bomb the National Directorate of Security, a governmental intelligence building next door to the hospital, but were unable to park there so they ended up parking in front of the hospital instead. Governor Rahmatullah Yarmal later said that the hospital had been destroyed. The hospital was the main health facility in Zabul Province before the bombing.\n\n== References ==","urls":["https:\/\/news.sky.com\/story\/suicide-attack-on-hospital-in-afghanistan-kills-at-least-20-11813818","https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2019\/09\/killed-car-bomb-attack-afghan-province-zabul-190919042138106.html","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-49751370"]}

{"title":"2019 Quetta bombing","article":"The 2019 Quetta bombing was a suicide bomb attack on an open marketplace in Quetta, Pakistan on 12 April, killing 21 people. The bombing took place near an area where many minority Shiite Muslims live. At least ten Hazara, including nine Shiites, were among the dead. Two paramilitary soldiers were also killed in the bombing. PM Imran Khan expressed condolences for the lives lost, directed the authorities to ensure the best medical treatment for the injured, and ordered an increase in security for Shiites and Hazara people. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and ISIL later accepted responsibility for the attack, stating that \"their target were Hazara people.\"\n\n== Background ==\nHazaras have been frequently targeted by Taliban and Islamic State militants and other Sunni Muslim militant groups in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. They have been heavily targeted in Afghanistan in attacks claimed by an affiliate of the Islamic State. 509 Hazara people has been killed in terror related incidents in the last 5 years alone in Quetta. Most of them have been killed in targeted killings, mass shootings, and suicide attacks. Sunni extremist groups consider Hazara people to be kafirs, as they are predominantly Shia.\n\n== Blast ==\nA suicide attack was carried out in the late afternoon of 12 April 2019 by the Sunni militant at a potato stall in a crowded Hazarganji vegetable market. One survivor reported the blast being so powerful that the air was filled with black smoke and people were unable to hear each other. 20 people including one paramilitary soldier were killed, as well as the perpetrator. On 16 April, one more paramilitary soldier died of his injuries.\n\n== Responsibility ==\nInitially, no group claimed responsibility for the blast. After some hours, the leader of Sunni militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed responsibility for the attack and issued a warning that more attacks were planned. A spokesperson of the group, Qari Saifullah, told CNN \"We claim responsibility for the attack in Quetta, we targeted the Hazara community.\" The same group had previously carried out attacks against Hazara minorities.\n\nISIL also claimed the responsibility of this attack, releasing a photograph of the bomber along with his name. Various Sunni militant groups in Pakistan, including  Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, have been backed by ISIL for several years.\n\n== Reaction ==\nPakistan's ruling Government PTI condemned the attack and wrote on Twitter: \"We strongly condemn the terrorist attack in #Quetta that resulted in the loss of innocent lives. Prayers for the injured and for the precious lives lost in this heinous attack. Condolences to the families who lost their loved ones.\n\nQuetta, the capital of Pakistan's restive southwestern province of Balochistan, is often targeted by militants, although this was the first such attack this year. \"We will not bow before terrorists,\" Balochistan's chief minister, Jam Kamal Khan, said in a statement shortly after the bombing.\n\nPakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan echoed the condemnation. In a tweet, he wrote: \"Deeply saddened & have strongly condemned the terrorist attack in Hazarganji market area of Quetta targeting our innocent people.

Stay strong Quetta #QuettaGladiators #QuettaAttack #WeStandUnited.\"\n\nPakistan Foreign Minister condemned the attack, wrote a tweet, \"A very sad day in Pakistan as Balochistan is hit by two bomb blasts in Quetta and Chaman but our resolve to continue fighting terrorism in all its forms remains unshaken. My thoughts and prayers with those who lost their lives and loved ones in these heinous attacks.\" Turkey's foreign minister also condemned the attack, wrote on Twitter,\"Terrible news from #Pakistan.

Heartfelt condolences @SMQureshiPTI.\" \u201cWe received the news with deep sorrow that a bomb blast which took place at a marketplace today in Quetta, capital of the Balochistan province of Pakistan, resulted in many loss of lives and left many others wounded, We condemn this heinous terrorist attack and wish Allah's mercy upon those who lost their lives, a speedy recovery to the wounded, and convey our condolences to the Government and brotherly people of Pakistan,\u201d the Turkish Foreign Ministry said in the statement.\n\nIn a statement, the Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Pakistan said Saudi Arabia stood with Pakistan against all forms of violence, terrorism and extremism. \u201cSaudi Arabia also shares grief with the government and people of Pakistan and prays for early recovery of those injured in the incident,\u201d the statement added.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n=== Protests ===\nThe Hazara people protested regarding the perceived lack of security for them, claiming that \"the Hazara community was being targeted but they weren\u2019t provided effective security.\" Provincial Home Minister Zia Lango visited the site but dialogue with the Hazara community failed once again on security purposes. Hazaras demanded security from Prime Minister Imran Khan. Shortly after the bombing struck near a Shiite residential area, dozens of angry Shiite youths rallied in Quetta, demanding more security from the authorities and the arrest of those behind the attacks. They also denounced the violence by Sunni extremists who have killed hundreds in similar attacks over the past years in Balochistan province. \"It seems people from the (Shiite) Hazara community were the target,\" said senior police chief Abdur Razzaq Cheema.\n\nMembers of the Hazara community staged a sit-in at Quetta's Western Bypass for over 23 hours, demanded better security measures following the blast. Women and children are among those who staged a sit-in since shortly after the blast. The protesters demanded that the government implements an effective security plan and ensure the protection of the Hazara community. Pakistani Shiite youth from Hazara community burn tires to block the main road during a protest to condemn the attack.\n\nHazara protesters refuse to end the Quetta sit-in even after the third day, with protesters continuing to block the western bypass. Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Syed Ali Haider Zaidi arrived in the provincial capital and met the affected families on the behalf of Prime Minister Imran Khan, stating \"Federal government claimed full responsibility of protecting its citizens regardless of their caste, creed, religion or province and Government is taking strict action and seriously pursuing the investigations into the suicide attack.\" However, the protesters refused to call off their sit-in, demanded the attendance of Prime Minister Imran Khan, the capture of people behind the suicide attack and security of Hazara people. \n\nRepresenting the protesters, advocate Tahir Hazara expressed dismay over the federal government's attitude and regretted that Prime Minister Imran Khan had no time to visit Quetta after the tragic incident. However, he stated no one was safe in Quetta, saying that along with ordinary people, security personnel too had been martyred, adding that it raised questions over the capabilities of the government. He said the state must act without further delay because the people were tired of lifting the coffins of their loved ones. Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) president Sardar Akhtar Jan Mengal visited the protest camp of the Hazara community and expressed solidarity with the protestors. A large number of people also staged a protest demonstration outside the Quetta Press Club after marching on main roads, protests erupted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Punjab too.\n\nAfter 4 days, the Hazara community ends sit-in after receiving assurances from state minister, Balochistan CM. However, protesters still demanded Imran Khan to visit them, \"Prime Minister Imran Khan should come and console us,\" Muhammad Raza, another participant of the sit-in, had said. \"This time the government should go beyond words and do something practical for our protection.\" Minister of state of Interior Shehryar Khan Afridi had visited the Imam Bargah located in Hazara town to condole with the bereaved family members, speaking to the media, Afridi said \"The federal government will play its role in making sure that these heinous crimes end, I stand  with the community and I assure you that the government has been working to ensure that such crimes end. That is why this was the first such incident to occur over the span of nine months,\" \"we won't let anyone divide Pakistan\", he added.\n\nOn 16 April, both President Arif Alvi and the opposition party's leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited Quetta to offer condolences to Hazara community, President Arif Alvi showed solidarity to families and said \"The entire nation stands by the Hazara community in this hour of grief,\" acknowledged it was the responsibility of the state to protect the people and said \"Nation stands united.\"Earlier, talking to media persons in Quetta, the president had reaffirmed the government's commitment towards the implementation of the National Action Plan and  commended CM Balochistan's commitment of announcing a compensation package for the victims.\n\nMeanwhile, Opposition Leader Bilawal Zardari condemns the government and point out their duel standards, he said, \"On one hand they say the government is standing with the victims of the incident, and on the other a video exists where a federal minister is seen giving assurances to murderers and saying that no one will be able to touch them, Till when will have these dual standards, till when will this terrorism continue, victims need to be mainstreamed not terrorists.\" He showed condolence to the victims and also praised the army for eliminating the terrorists in recent years but he also provoked the emotional sentiments, stated, \u201cNo one can fight extremism alone, but we have to decide for the future. We need to fight this extremist mindset. When we ask for justice, we are called an enemy of the state. When I speak against banned organisations, I\u2019m branded an enemy of the state.\" he referred to his recent controversy where he was accused of using the Indian Sentiments against Pakistan's Government of not taking strict action against terrorist's organisations.\n\nArif Alvi also promised that Imran Khan will visit Balochistan on April 18. Khan will visit the victims in Quetta, he is scheduled to preside over an important meeting to analyse peace and security situation in Balochistan.

Action on terrorists' hideouts and against their leaders will also be boosted, the caucus affirmed.\n\n=== Security of Hazara people ===\nQadir Nayil, a Hazara community leader, asked the government for the provision of better protection.\n\"Once again our people were the target and once again we will have to bury our dear ones,\" he said. \"We demand more security from the government and all those involved in today's act of terrorism should be found and punished.\" Prime Minister Imran Khan has issued  a statement regarding the attack, told to increase the security of Hazara people.\n\n=== Operation Radd ul fasaad ===\n\nAfter the blast, Pakistan Armed forces fastened the Operation to arrest the people behind the attack, terrorists and suspects connecting to them.

{"title":"Death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi","article":"On October 26\u201327, 2019, the United States conducted Operation Kayla Mueller, a military operation named after Kayla Mueller, that resulted in the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the then-leader and self-proclaimed \"caliph\" of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terror organization. The operation took place in the outskirts of Barisha, Idlib Governorate, Syria. According to General Kenneth \"Frank\" McKenzie, the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) commander who oversaw the operation, Baghdadi killed himself along with two children when he detonated a suicide belt while seeking to evade the U.S. forces during the raid.\n\n==Background==\nThe raid was launched based on an intelligence effort to locate the leader of ISIL by CIA's Special Activities Center. The New York Times reported that, according to two U.S. officials, the CIA obtained the original intelligence on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi following the arrests of one of his wives and a courier, after which the CIA worked closely with Iraqi and Kurdish intelligence officials in Iraq and Syria. The Guardian, however, reported Iraqi officials as saying that the break came after a smuggler (who had smuggled the wives of two brothers of Baghdadi and Baghdadi's children in the past), a woman thought to be his wife, and Baghdadi's nephew provided information on the routes and destinations. Iraqi officials also stated that the arrest of Muhammad Ali Sajid al-Zobaie, Baghdadi's brother-in-law, helped them in finding a desert tunnel leading to two hideouts, filled with items, near Al-Qaim, Iraq, and thereby penetrate a smuggling ring to find Baghdadi. A U.S. official disputed the Iraqi account that Iraq had provided the exact location of Baghdadi, and stated that the operation was triggered when he appeared in a location where they already had established intelligence collection.\n\n===Location===\n\nReuters reported Iraqi intelligence officials as stating that the arrest of several Islamic State leaders was the key behind learning about Baghdadi's movements and hiding places. They said that Ismael al-Ethawi, believed to be a top aide to Baghdadi, was found and followed by informants in Syria, apprehended by Turkish authorities, and handed over to Iraqi intelligence agents to whom he provided information in February 2018. The Iraqis then gave the information to the CIA, who kept surveillance on the discovered location through a satellite and drones. They also said that in 2019 the United States, Turkish and Iraqi intelligence conducted a joint operation in which they captured several high-ranking ISIL leaders, including four Iraqis and a Syrian, who provided the locations where they met with Baghdadi inside Syria, after which they decided to coordinate with the CIA to deploy more sources inside these areas. One of the Iraqi officials remarked that \"his last moment to live\" was when Baghdadi and his family left the location that he was in for the first time. Ethawi and the other aides in an interview to The New York Times stated that they were blindfolded before being taken to meet their leader, in order to keep his whereabouts secret, they were then kept at the location for hours before being blindfolded again and driven away from the site.\n\nBaghdadi's compound was located near GPS coordinates 36.1660, 36.6274, in Syria's Idlib Governorate. Although Idlib is dominated by the Islamic State's rival jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which has connections to al-Qaeda, the Institute for the Study of War warned that Idlib is nevertheless the focus of an ISIL strategy to have it serve as an incubator for the next iteration of ISIL and al-Qaeda recruits. In July 2019, then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford explained that there were around 20,000-30,000 fighters in Idlib by that time in the ongoing Syrian Civil War, which started in 2011. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East Michael P. Mulroy said that \"Idlib is essentially the largest collection of al-Qaeda affiliates in the world.\" In regards to Baghdadi's possible rationale for choosing the location, \"We assess that he was hiding in Idlib province to avoid the intense pressure that had been put on ISIS in other areas of Syria,\" operational commander Gen. Kenneth McKenzie later stated.\n\nDocuments later obtained by Al Aan TV's Jenan Moussa reportedly revealed that, from February 1, 2019 until the day of the U.S. raid, Baghdadi's compound had internet access and that the owner of the site paid the equivalent of an $8 monthly fee in cash to the regional ISP for service. According to Moussa, the username Baghdadi used was \"mhrab.\"\n\n===Kurdish role===\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) reported that they provided direct and extensive support to the operation. Prior to the raid, the SDF, working with the U.S. government, had spent five months gathering intelligence on Baghdadi's location. A senior U.S. State Department official said that the Kurdish-led SDF \"played a key role\" in the raid on Baghdadi's compound and that the United States was in close communication with SDF commander Gen. Mazloum Abdi about every aspect of their operation, and Abdi's statements about the raid, in reference to the joint intelligence cooperation on the ground, were accurate. Gen. Mazloum Abdi said the operation had been delayed by a month due to Turkey's military build-up at the Syrian border and the Turkish incursion into northeastern Syria that followed. The New York Times reported that unnamed U.S. intelligence, military, and counter-terrorism officials said that the abrupt withdrawal of U.S. forces from northern Syria by President Donald Trump had complicated the plans for the operation against Baghdadi, but the Syrian Kurds continued to provide information to the CIA amidst the Turkish offensive. One of the officials remarked that both the Syrian and Iraqi Kurds had provided more intelligence for the raid than any single country.\n\nCENTCOM commander Frank McKenzie later confirmed the SDF had provided intelligence to American forces prior to the raid in Idlib, but denied reports that the president's prior order to withdraw forces from north Syria had any impact on the timing or execution of the mission.\n\n====Embedded informant====\nThe Washington Post reported that, according to a U.S. official, an ISIL militant-turned informant for the Kurds had provided critical intelligence about Baghdadi's location. The SDF commander Mazloum Abdi said that their informant was deep inside Baghdadi's inner circle as a security adviser and had provided a detailed layout of the complex, and was on-site during the operation, after which he left with the U.S. forces. SDF officials said that the informant had stolen Baghdadi's underwear and a sample of Baghdadi's blood, which was provided to the U.S. intelligence for DNA analysis and resulted in a positive match. U.S. and Middle East\u2013based officials stated that the informant was a Sunni Arab ISIL operative, who served as a trusted facilitator and logistics aide to Baghdadi, but defected because ISIL killed his relative, after which he was cultivated as an intelligence asset by the SDF. They said that, after the SDF leadership handed control over the informant to the U.S. intelligence, the informant was carefully vetted for several weeks by the U.S. intelligence and that the effort to exploit the intelligence asset began in the summer of 2019. The informant was subsequently extracted from the region with his family two days after the raid and will likely receive at least some of the $25 million bounty.\n\n==Prelude==\nTwo U.S. officials stated that Baghdadi had been staying at the compound in Barisha since July 2019 and that it had been under surveillance since, but U.S. forces avoided assaulting it due to the presence of al-Qaeda affiliates and the airspace being controlled by Russia and the Syrian government. Some U.S. officials claimed that the Pentagon decided to carry out the mission after President Donald Trump ordered the withdrawal of U.S. forces from northern Syria in early October, as to not lose track of Baghdadi. However, CENTCOM commander Frank McKenzie has stated that the north Syria pullout had \"absolutely\" no effect on the timing or execution of the operation. \"We chose the time based on a variety of factors: weather, certainty, lunar data ... We struck because the time was about right to do it then given the totality of the intelligence and the other factors that would affect the raid force going in and coming out,\" General McKenzie added.\n\nThe Turkish Defense Ministry said that Turkish and U.S. military authorities exchanged and coordinated information ahead of the attack in Idlib. A U.S. official stated that Turkey was informed prior to the operation to avoid an unintended clash between their forces, but was not notified about the target due to concerns that the information would become compromised and did not provide any assistance to the operation. Turkish officials also informed Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which controls much of the area where the raid took place, not to open fire on the helicopters that would be used in the operation; despite being informed, anti-aircraft fire by HTS was used, however the operators were detained by HTS commanders afterwards for not following orders.\n\nGen. McKenzie briefed Defense Department leaders on the intelligence and the plan on October 25 and received the approval of Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley for the operation. President Trump was then briefed \"on all aspects of the plan and the risks involved in its execution\" and that Russia and Turkey were contacted ahead of the mission to avoid unintended clashes. With Trump's approval, McKenzie, as operational commander, gave the order for the mission to start October 26 around 9 a.m. EST.\n\n==Raid==\n\nOn October 26, 2019, shortly after U.S. president Donald Trump and a small team of key civilian and military leaders gathered in the White House Situation Room at around 5 p.m. EST (23:00 Syria time), U.S. Joint Special Operations Command's (JSOC) 1st SFOD-D (Delta Force) operators, along with U.S. Army Rangers from the 75th Ranger Regiment, departed Al Asad Airbase in Iraq in eight U.S. military helicopters, including Boeing MH-47 Chinooks and Sikorsky MH-60L\/M Blackhawks, to conduct an air assault raid on an \"isolated compound\" 300 meters outside Barisha village\u2014located five kilometers (three miles) south of the border with Turkey in hostile rebel-held territory in Idlib Governorate of Syria\u2014to kill or capture Baghdadi; the assault force reportedly flew through Turkish-controlled and Russian-monitored airspace towards the objective and landed after 70 minutes.\n\nAccording to Gen. Frank McKenzie, who oversaw the operation, air cover for the assault included armed helicopters, multiple drones, and fighter aircraft providing close air support; they planned for multiple children\/non-militants at the compound and tried to minimize casualties. As the heli-borne assault force approached Baghdadi's compound, the helicopters reportedly came under gunfire from two locations from non-ISIL militant groups that were outside the target building but in the area of operations; according to Gen. McKenzie, they were neutralized with two airstrikes from supporting helicopters. The Delta Force operators, supported by military working dogs and military robots, landed outside the compound and surrounded it, repeatedly calling on its occupants to come out peacefully in Arabic. \"Those who came out of the building were checked for weapons and explosives and moved away,\" Gen. McKenzie said. \"U.S. forces detained and later released the noncombatants. The group was treated humanely at all times, and included 11 children.\" Five ISIL members inside the compound\u2014four women and one man\u2014\"presented a threat to the force\" and were killed when they did not respond to commands to surrender, as they were suspected of wearing suicide vests. Believing the main entrance to be booby trapped, operators breached the compound's walls with explosives.\n\n\nOnce Delta was inside the target building, Baghdadi fled into a tunnel network under the premises wearing a suicide vest and carrying two children with him; by the time he reached a dead end, an explosive ordinance disposal military robot and a dog (later identified as a male Belgian Malinois named \"Conan\") had been dispatched to subdue him. He detonated his vest, killing himself and two children, and causing the tunnel to collapse. The children killed were believed to be younger than 12 years old. U.S. soldiers dug through the debris to retrieve some of Baghdadi's remains and lab technicians successfully conducted DNA profiling and biometrics tests within 15 minutes of his death via Defense Intelligence Agency analysis, confirming Baghdadi's identity. According to the White House, \"a combination of visual evidence and DNA tests confirmed Baghdadi\u2019s identity.\" The quick DNA confirmation is attributed to special forces already possessing samples of Baghdadi's tissue, reportedly voluntarily provided by one of his daughters, according to a U.S. official. McKenzie, however, stated that they were obtained from his time in Camp Bucca.\n\nTwo adult male captives and a \"substantial\" amount of documents and electronic items were seized from the compound during the raid which, per U.S. officials, was a primary goal so they could understand the current leadership structure of ISIL. Items included 5-6 cellphones, 2-4 laptops and some USB flash drives. Just before 3:30 am Syrian time, U.S. choppers departed the area for Iraq and the compound was then destroyed by airstrikes from overhead F-15 jets and MQ-9 Reaper drones, reportedly to prevent the site from becoming a \"shrine\" for sympathizers. According to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, a wide variety of munitions, including AGM-158 JASSM cruise missiles, unspecified precision-guided bombs, and AGM-114 Hellfire guided missiles, were responsible for leveling Baghdadi's compound.\n\nGen. McKenzie, who called the operation \"exquisitely planned and executed,\" stated that the special forces who took part in the operation were based in Syria and that only U.S. personnel were involved in the raid on the compound itself. The entire operation lasted roughly two hours.\n\n==Aftermath==\nGeneral McKenzie called in and announced the mission's success to President Donald Trump's team in the White House Situation Room, saying \"Got him, 100 percent confidence, jackpot, over,\" according to National Security Advisor Robert O'brien.\n\n===Trump press conference===\n\n\nAt 9:23 p.m. EST, President Trump tweeted \"Something very big has just happened!\" with the White House subsequently announcing a planned press conference at 9 a.m. the next morning. At the presser, fourteen hours after the raid, Trump announced Baghdadi's death and went on to describe the successful operation against him in detail, reporting that U.S. forces used helicopters, jets, and drones through airspace controlled by Russia and Turkey. He also said that they had Baghdadi \"under surveillance for 'a couple of weeks' and 'two or three' raids had been canceled because of his movements\". He continued: \"The forces targeted the compound using eight helicopters, which were met with hostile fire. The commandos entered the building by blowing holes in the wall, avoiding the main door which was booby-trapped.\" Trump announced that Baghdadi died by detonating a suicide vest after he was chased by U.S. military dogs and was cornered inside a tunnel. He and other officials initially stated that the explosion killed three of his children alongside him, however Gen. Frank McKenzie later said it had been confirmed only two were killed. Trump said Baghdadi died \"like a dog and a coward\" and \"whimpering and crying and screaming\", but Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley and various Pentagon and administration officials either could not confirm, or outright denied, the \"whimpering and crying\" detail as Trump reportedly had only seen drone surveillance without live audio.\n\nReportedly, some U.S. officials said that Trump's press conference contained several pieces of information that were inaccurate, highly classified, or tactically sensitive. These allegations have yet to be proven or substantiated.\n\n===Casualties===\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark A. Milley said during a Pentagon briefing that Baghdadi's corpse disposal \"was handled appropriately\", initially adding that Washington had no plans to release images of his death, but later showed footage of the raid during a briefing on October 30. Baghdadi was buried at sea and afforded Islamic rites, three anonymous U.S. officials told Reuters and a Pentagon source told AFP. An aide of Baghdadi, who handled logistics, was the other man killed according to Iraqi officials. United States secretary of state Mike Pompeo said that two wives of al-Baghdadi were also killed in the raid.\n\n\nTrump said no U.S. soldiers were injured, but Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said two had been lightly injured during the raid. An American Special Operations Military Working Dog (SOMWD), a male Belgian Malinois named Conan, who chased Baghdadi, was treated for his injuries and returned to work on October 28. During a news conference that day, Esper and Milley declined to identify him for security reasons; Trump released a declassified photograph of him later in the day. The dog was injured due to live electrical cables that were exposed, according to McKenzie.\n\nAccording to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) war monitor, Delta Force killed nine people, including one child, two women and some high-ranking ISIL leaders. Baghdadi's suicide vest killed two more children, reportedly his own. The Americans captured two militants and rescued eleven children. General Frank McKenzie said six ISIL members, which included four women and another man asides from Baghdadi, were killed in the operation. The raid also killed about 10 to 15 members of other groups who engaged American forces.\n\nDelta also killed a local Guardians of Religion Organization commander, identified as Abu Muhammad al-Halabi, the owner of the house Baghdadi was staying at. An Iraqi intelligence official and Hisham al-Hashimi have stated to The Independent that Halabi was also a smuggler, which is why the ISIL head and his family utilized his services. The inhabitants of the village stated that he was a sheep seller, but rarely interacted with his neighbors. His other alias is believed to be Abu Mohammed Salama and his corpse was flown away by Delta Force after the raid according to Barisha's inhabitants. He, along with some other Hurras al-Din, members is also suspected to have been part of a pro-ISIL faction.\n\nBased on a receipt book of ISIL found by associates of former American intelligence official Asaad Almohammad, analysts have stated that Baghdadi was paying the members of the group in exchange for hiding him. According to the receipt book, ISIL paid at least $67,000 to them from early 2017 to mid-2018, including $7,000 in summer 2018 to prepare bases for ISIL fighters from \"al-Khair province\", hinting that they helped in smuggling ISIL members. Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi pointed to the fact that the two groups were enemies, citing a warning by Hurras al-Din to its members in February 2019 to avoid contact with ISIL and the latter issuing the similar statement about the former in July. However, Tamimi also said that some of the receipts might be fabrications, except the ones from March to July 2018 that he was shown.\n\n====Possible civilian casualties====\n\nBesides the two children killed by Baghdadi's suicide detonation, the U.S. military reported no civilian casualties during the operation.\n\nA report by NPR released on December 3, 2019 cited a local farmer, Barakat Ahmad Barakat, as saying that his right hand and forearm were blown off and his two friends were killed by U.S. helicopter fire during the operation. According to Barakat's account, Khaled Mustafa Qurmo and Khaled Abdel Majid Qurmo, two cousins, were driving him home in Barisha on October 26 when helicopters fired on their white van. All three exited the vehicle, but one fell, his legs filled with shrapnel. A follow-up strike targeted the group again, killing the two cousins and blowing off a chunk of Barakat's right arm. The cousins died of shrapnel wounds to the chest, according to autopsy reports by a Syrian doctor with the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations, an international medical group. Several relatives said the cousins operated a van service and had no connection to ISIL or any armed group; Barakat said the van carried no weapons. Relatives provided video and photos of the scene and the destroyed van to NPR.\n\nAn unidentified U.S. defense official told NPR by email that it was the first civilian casualty report they received related to the raid, and that initial reports suggested that a white van in the vicinity had fired on U.S. helicopters. \"Surveillance footage will be reviewed to determine if an investigation needs to be opened based upon this additional information,\" the official said. Former Pentagon intelligence analyst Marc Garlasco suggested the shrapnel damage at the scene resembled that caused by Hydra 70 rockets, a type used by U.S. military helicopters. Garlasco also suggested the secondary strikes on the men fleeing the van was consistent with a U.S. military practice of targeting \"squirters\"\u2014people perceived to be hostiles running away from an attack. The U.S. military has not confirmed whether it fired on the white van during the raid.\n\n==Analysis==\nA November 6, 2019 Brookings Institution analysis framed the raid's success as a reminder of the United States' \"power and resolve\" in the War on Terror, remarking on three particular aspects of the operation: intelligence collection, international cooperation, and operational capability. Brookings asserted that it was a combination of U.S. hard power and soft power that secured cooperation with Turkey, Russia, Iraq and the Kurds and noted that a synergized combination of HUMINT, SIGINT, and visual intelligence gathering was the key to translating the ISIL informant's information into actionable operational intelligence, such as how the deployment of military dogs indicated U.S. forces were expecting close-quarters obstacles thanks to intelligence reports. The analysis stated that despite Baghdadi's eight years of experience evading capture or death, the operation succeeded due to the U.S. professionally utilizing the \"Find, Fix, Finish\" intelligence cycle standard: Narrow down Baghdadi's suspected location (the Find), verify his identity and location and translate the intelligence into a feasible action plan (the Fix), and subdue the target (the Finish).\n\nA November 19, 2019 Department of Defense Inspector General report, citing Defense Intelligence Agency assessments, stated that Baghdadi's death was \"a significant blow to ISIS but would not likely end the ISIS threat\" and that his demise \"would likely have little effect on the ability of ISIS to reconstitute\" itself as a potent transnational threat, according to open-source analysis. A report from the DIA in 2020 concluded that Baghdadi's death did not have an immediate impact on ISIL's abilities to operate, as the group's command structure was fairly decentralized by the time of the raid.\n\n==Reactions==\n\nRepresentatives of several countries, including Australia, France, Israel, and the United Kingdom, congratulated the United States and said that the death of Baghdadi marked a turning point in the fight against ISIL.\n*  - Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the raid's result, if confirmed, represented a serious contribution by the United States toward combating terrorism.\n*  - Iran, on the other hand, stated that Baghdadi's death was not significant and stated that the actions of the United States are responsible for the rise of ISIL. Iran said that the killing of Baghdadi did not mean the group's end, as sectarianism and terrorism still very much exist and are being exploited by countries like the U.S.\n*  - In an interview with the French magazine Paris Match published on November 27, 2019, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad dismissed any suggestion the Syrian government had anything to do with the raid and affirmed his skepticism of the operation's success, calling it a \"fantastic play staged by the Americans\" and quipping \"...was al-Baghdadi really killed or not?\" Assad made similar remarks to Syria TV weeks prior, calling the operation \"little more than a trick\" and likening U.S. politics to Hollywood.\n* - Mohammed bin Salman commended Trump on the killing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, describing the event as a turning point in the fight against extremism. Saudi Arabia said Baghdadi had perverted the reputation of Islam and welcomed his death at the hands of US commandos. The kingdom said it is thankful to the US for its efforts to track members of this terrorist organization.\n* - Egypt said the death marked a significant achievement in the efforts to combat extremism. The country also advocated for a comprehensive approach that acknowledged the security, developmental, and theoretical dimensions in the battle against armed actors.\n* - President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said al-Baghdadi's killing was a turning point in the fight against terrorism.\n* - Afghanistan praised al-Baghdadi's killing as a significant blow and anticipated it would weaken ISIL's activities in Afghanistan.\n* - Jordan characterized al-Baghdadi's death as a major step in the battle against terrorists and their principles of hate. The country also said it will remain on the frontlines to eradicate extremism in partnership with its allies.\n* - Bahrain lauded the raid and said it was a \"fatal blow to the group.\"\n* - Japan said the death of al-Baghdadi was a crucial turning point towards serenity and stability in the Middle East. However, the country also cautioned that the war against terrorism had not ended.\n* - The Philippines said Baghdadi's death was only a temporary setback for the group because of ISIL's comprehensiveness and reach worldwide.\n* - Iraq noted its part in locating Baghdadi and said it would continue to track and prosecute the organization \n* - The prime minister of Sri Lanka, Ranil Wickremesinghe congratulated President Donald Trump after the raid. He said that IS has been fomenting horror and dismay across the globe and that the operation makes the world a more secure place.\n* - The German government took the time to reflect on the victims of IS after the raid. Government spokesman Steffen Seibert said Baghdadi can't order any more killings, but added that the fight against the organization will continue.\n* - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the death of Baghdadi was a good time to remember the casualties of terrorism. U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said that IS had perpetrated wicked human rights violations and ushered in disaster and death to thousands of men, women, and children. Lastly, he added the world has made visible progress against Daesh.\n* - The European Union said the death of Baghdadi was a major blow to the organization but warned that it still remains a major threat.\n* - NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg stated the raid was a great accomplishment in the efforts against global terrorism.\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces said the raid was the outcome of intelligence sharing between parties on the ground and thanked those involved in the operation.\n\n===ISIL response and subsequent operations===\n\n\nNews of the death of Baghdadi was ignored by official ISIL channels for days and the group did not immediately confirm his death. Many ISIL supporters refused to believe he was dead, while some others accepted it. Supporters of ISIL's rival jihadist groups like Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and al-Qaeda praised his death because of his group's noted record for cruelty. Salafi cleric Abdullah al-Muhaysini celebrated Baghdadi's demise and called on ISIL members to defect. The activity of jihadist supporters in general temporarily decreased online as well.\n\nISIL's Amaq News Agency confirmed Baghdadi's death on October 31 and announced Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi as his successor. Abu Hamza al-Qurayshi became their new spokesman after its prior spokesperson, Abul-Hasan al-Muhajir, was killed in an October 27 U.S. strike in northwest Syria following the Barisha raid. In an audio message, Hamza al-Qurayshi described U.S. President Donald Trump as \"a crazy old man\" and warned the U.S. to \"not rejoice\" and that ISIL supporters would avenge Baghdadi's death.\n\nSince Baghdadi's death several of the leaders operating under him have been killed or captured, along with some of his family members:\n\nOn November 4, Turkish communications director Fahrettin Altun stated that Rasmiya Awad, Baghdadi's lesser-known older sister, had been captured. According to Reuters, citing Turkish officials, Awad was captured in a raid on a shipping container in the Turkish-controlled Syrian border town of Azaz and that Turkish authorities were interrogating her husband and daughter-in-law who were also detained. When captured, she was also accompanied by five children. \"We hope to gather a trove of intelligence from Baghdadi\u2019s sister on the inner workings of ISIS,\" Altun stated. Little independent information is available on Baghdadi's sister and Reuters was not immediately able to verify if the captured individual was her.\n\nOn December 3, Iraqi security forces announced the capture of Baghdadi's \"deputy\" who operated under the name \"Abu Khaldoun\". According to security officials, a police unit in Hawija, Kirkuk Governorate, Iraq, tracked down Khaldoun to an apartment in the March 1 area where he was hiding; he possessed a fake I.D. under the name of Shaalan Obeid when apprehended. Khaldoun was previously ISIL's \"military prince\" of Iraq's Saladin Governorate.\n\nOn December 26, Boko Haram, the West African branch of ISIL, killed 11 captives in what the group called a \"message for Christians\" and a retaliation for the killing of Baghdadi and Abul-Hasan al-Muhajir.\n\n==See also==\n\n* Death of Osama bin Laden, similar raid that targeted al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in 2011.\n* Turkey\u2013ISIL conflict\n* Rojava\u2013Islamist conflict\n* List of United States special forces raids during the Syrian Civil War\n* Battle of Baghuz Fawqani\n* Assassination of Qasem Soleimani, targeted killing of Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani in 2020.\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n\n*  Statement from the President on the Death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, October 27, 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom left: U.S. National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, Vice President Mike Pence, President Donald Trump, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Chairman Mark Milley, and Brig.

{"title":"2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings","article":"On 21 April 2019, Easter Sunday, three churches in Sri Lanka and three luxury hotels in the commercial capital, Colombo, were targeted in a series of coordinated Islamic terrorist suicide bombings. Later that day, there were smaller explosions at a housing complex in Dematagoda and a guest house in Dehiwala. Two hundred and fifty-nine people were killed, including at least 45 foreign nationals and three police officers, and at least 500 were injured, which then resulted in the imposing of an immediate Curfew and a complete Social Media Ban by the government. The church bombings were carried out during Easter services in Negombo, Batticaloa and Colombo; the hotels that were bombed were the Shangri-La, Cinnamon Grand, Kingsbury and Tropical Inn. According to the State Intelligence Service a second wave of attacks was also planned but was stopped as a result of government raids.\n\nAccording to Sri Lankan government officials, all seven of the suicide bombers in the attacks were Sri Lankan citizens associated with National Thowheeth Jama'ath, a local militant Islamist group with suspected foreign ties, previously known for attacks against Buddhists and Sufis. State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene said in parliament on 23 April that the government believed the attack was in retaliation for the attack against Muslims in Christchurch on 15 March 2019. The direct linkage between the two attacks was questioned by New Zealand's government and by some experts. The NTJ had been stockpiling explosives at least since January 2019.\n\nOn 23 April 2019, Amaq News Agency, a propaganda outlet for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), stated that \u2033the perpetrators of the attack targeting the citizens of coalition countries and Christians in Sri Lanka were Islamic State fighters\u2033. Sri Lanka was not part of the anti-ISIL coalition, and the overwhelming majority of those killed were Sri Lankan citizens. A man believed to be long-silent ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi praised the attackers during an 18-minute video on a range of topics. The Criminal Investigation Department has however stated that there was no evidence of its direct involvement and the group was convinced by the perpetrators to take responsibility.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nHistorically, terrorism in Sri Lanka mostly involved coordinated attacks by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) against the government and army during the Sri Lankan Civil War, which began in 1983. The LTTE was defeated in 2009 in its effort to violently seize control of the northern and eastern coasts of the island from the Sinhalese ethnic majority to create an independent Tamil state. The Marxist-Leninist party Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) also held uprisings in 1971 and 1987\u201389.\n\nThe main religions in Sri Lanka are Buddhism (70.3%), Hinduism (12.6%), Islam (9.7%) and Christianity (6.1%), with 82% of the Christians being Roman Catholics. The remaining Christians are evenly split between the Anglican Church of Ceylon and other Protestant denominations.\n\nDuring the 2010s, a low but persisting number of attacks and threats were made against Christian congregations and individuals, as well as other religious minorities, by local monks, although they may or may not be actual members of the Buddhist clergy. Anglican Bishop of Colombo Dhiloraj Canagasabey called for constitutional rights on religion to be protected. In 2018, the National Christian Evangelical Alliance of Sri Lanka (NCEASL) reported a large increase in the number of attacks against Christians in the country that year. This coincided with a Supreme Court ruling against a Catholic organisation in August, which deemed that proselytism was not protected by the constitution (though individual freedom of religion remained protected).\n\nEaster Sunday is Christianity's holiest day and church attendance in Sri Lanka is very high on this day. This was the first time since 2009, the end of the Sri Lankan Civil War, that the country had experienced a major terrorist attack.\n\n=== Islamic radicalisation ===\nThe Sri Lankan government was aware of some foreigners arriving in Sri Lanka to spread what justice minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe called Islamic extremism. In November 2016 he told parliament that 32 Sri Lankan Muslims from \"well-educated and elite\" families joined the ISIL. On 25 April 2019, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe revealed that the government had known of the Sri Lankan nationals who had joined Islamic State and returned to the country \u2013 but they couldn't be arrested, because joining a foreign terrorist organisation is not against the law.\n\nIn the aftermath of the bombings investigations revealed that school textbooks for Islam published by the government also encouraged radicalisation of Muslims. The school books since the 1980s called for the death sentence for those who leave Islam.\n\n=== Prior to the attacks ===\nVice president of the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka Hilmy Ahamed had said about three years ago he warned military intelligence officials about the National Thowheeth Jama'ath, saying \"targeting the non-Muslim community is something they encourage \u2013 they say you have to kill them in the name of religion\".\n\nIndian intelligence agencies provided specific information to Sri Lankan authorities about the method and target locations for the potential terrorist attacks to Sri Lankan authorities as early as 4 April, and again on the night before, and as close as two hours, before the first attack. This included information about the threat to churches, gathered from interrogation of a suspected ISIL recruit in Indian custody.\n\nThe New York Times and AFP reported on a police chief warning security officials in an advisory ten days before the attacks of a threat to prominent churches from a radical Islamist group, National Thowheeth Jama'ath. No information in this regard had been passed to the senior politicians of the country; Minister Harin Fernando then tweeted images of an internal memo and report by the police intelligence of a terror attack planned by the founder of National Thowheeth Jama\u2019ath, Mohammed Zahran.\n\nInvestigators have said that Rilwan Hashim, brother of Zahran, had built the explosives alongside Mohammad Hasthoon. Zahran had claimed to have been appointed member of the Sri Lankan branch of Islamic State by one of its official and to be receiving orders directly from Syria, a claim investigators believe to have been fabricated. Zahran held a meeting in early April 2019 with over a dozen people in Panadura, where they decided upon the attack. Some participants however wanted to target the Buddhist festivals\n\nThe cohorts of Hashim had stayed in contact through Whatsapp and Telegram. The planning for a future attack may have begun in mid-2018, though the group hadn't selected any target. Investigators believe that the Easter attack plan came into being much later, with roles of perpetrators being decided upon only shortly before Easter. They had communicated through Threema a few weeks before the attack.\n\nIn January 2019 a stockpile of suspicious explosives were discovered near the Wilpattu National Park which contained 100 kilos of high explosives and 100 detonators. The Police confirmed that this was from a \"newly formed radical Muslim group\". On 16 April a parked motorcycle in Kattankudy carrying explosives detonated without casualties during a lightning storm.\n\n== Attacks ==\n\nChristians were attending Easter Sunday services when the bombings took place, targeting churches and hotels around Sri Lanka. The sequence and coordination of the bombings were planned to cause maximum destruction, targeting Christians during worship services across the island nation, and targeting guests during breakfast in beachfront hotels in the capital. All six of the first set of explosions targeting the churches and hotels were carried out by suicide bombers.\n\nThe first blast took place in the Shrine of St. Anthony, a historic Catholic church in the capital, where more than 50 people were killed. The second blast took place in St. Sebastian's Church in the Christian-majority suburb of Negombo, to the north of Colombo and Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte. Over 100 people were killed at St. Sebastian's Church. St. Sebastian's is also close to Sri Lanka's main airport, Bandaranaike International Airport, where security was heightened.\n\nOn the other side of the island in Batticaloa, a bomb blast 15 minutes later killed 30 people at the Protestant evangelical Zion Church.\n\nSri Lankan media reported at least 40 people killed in Colombo, between St. Anthony's and the hotels.\n\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Catholic Shrine of St. Anthony in Kotahena, Colombo, was the first to be hit, followed by the Catholic Church of St. Sebastian in Negombo. Sri Lankan news media initially reported at least 93 people killed at St. Sebastian's. In October 2019, the BBC reported that a total of 115 people had died in the St. Sebastian's bombing, including 27 children.\n\nThe Zion Church in Batticaloa, a Protestant congregation, was also bombed. Local news reported at least 30 killed in Batticaloa, with 9 of these reported by a police official to be tourists. A hospital official in the region said that more than 300 people had been admitted following the explosion. The BBC reported that the suicide bomber had attempted to enter the church under the guise of filming it, but was denied access because of the ongoing service. Instead, he detonated his bomb in the churchyard, killing many children from the attached Sunday school who were taking a break.\n\n=== Hotels ===\nThree 5-star hotels on the beachfront in central Colombo were attacked around the same time as the churches: the Shangri-La Hotel, the Cinnamon Grand Hotel and The Kingsbury.\n\nThe Shangri-La bombers struck at 08:57 hours (UTC+05:30) during breakfast in the Table One Restaurant on the hotel's third floor, which was reportedly full of foreign tourists who made up the bulk of the hotel's clientele.\n\nThe suicide bomber who struck at the Taprobane restaurant in the Cinnamon Grand hotel had checked into the hotel with a false name the night before, claiming to be on a business trip. The bomber entered the queue of the packed restaurant's breakfast buffet the next morning and detonated explosives strapped to his back as he was about to be served. One of the hotel's managers who was welcoming guests was among those killed instantly.\n\nThe reception hall of a guest house, the Tropical Inn in Dehiwala, was also attacked later in the day, with two deaths reported. Later on during investigations, It was found that the bomber's original target had being the Taj Samudra Hotel in Colombo. CCTV footage given to the media by the hotel, shows the bomber attempting to detonate his vest three times in the dining area and upon failing, leaving the premises at 8.49 a.m.\n\nThe Kingsbury hotel management resumed their operations on 24 April 2019 followed by Cinnamon Grand few days later; Shangri-La partially reopened on 12 June 2019.\n\n=== Residence ===\nA further bombing occurred later in the day when police executed a breach and clear at a suspect's house in the suburbs of Colombo; in Dematagoda killing three police officers and four others at the premises including the suicide bomber. The pregnant suicide bomber, whose three children were killed in the blast, was the wife of Ilham Ibrahim, the Shangri-La suicide bomber, and the sister-in-law of Inshaf Ahmed Ibrahim, the Cinnamon Grand suicide bomber.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe government closed facilities for security; the Defence Ministry issued a police curfew starting at 18:00 local time on the day of the attacks, and imposed a temporary social media ban, whilst the Minister of Education, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, had all schools closed for the following two days. The Colombo Stock Exchange announced that its operations will be temporarily suspended following the terror attacks, not opening as planned on 22 April 2019.\n\nAn improvised explosive device was found near the Bandaranaike International Airport in Colombo and was dismantled by the Sri Lankan Air Force.\n\nOn 22 April, the Special Task Force (STF), the elite counter-terrorism unit of the Sri Lanka Police, located a van belonging to the attackers near St. Anthony's Shrine, the site of one of the prior day's blasts. Upon inspection, the vehicle was found to have been rigged with 3 bombs. After the STF's bomb defusing unit evacuated the surrounding area, the bombs were detonated simultaneously during a defusing attempt. The same day, police reportedly found 87 items of bomb paraphernalia at the Bastian Mawatha Private Bus Station in Pettah.\n\nOn 25 April, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) released names and photos of six suspects wanted in connection over the Easter Sunday bombings, seeking public assistance. On 28 April, police confirmed two of the suspects, Mohomed Iwuhaim Saadiq Abdul Haq and Mohomed Iwuhaim Shahid Abdul Haq, who were arrested in Nawalapitiya and would be handed over to the CID.\n\nSince the attacks, any garment covering the face including the burqa and niqab, have been banned in Sri Lanka.\n\n=== Victims ===\n\n\nThe bombings killed 269 people and injured at least 500. Initially, 359 fatalities were reported; the Ministry of Health later reduced the number by 106 after cross-referencing DNA samples to body parts. The majority of the dead are Sri Lankans, with at least 45 foreigners among those killed.\n\nThe victims included:\n* Shantha Mayadunne, a Sri Lankan TV chef. Her daughter was also among the victims.\n* Three of the four children of the multi-billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, CEO of Danish clothing retailer Bestseller.\n* A maternal grandson of Bangladeshi politician Sheikh Selim.\n\nAt least 45 children, including nine who were foreigners, were killed. On 23 April, the first mass funeral was held at St. Sebastian's Church, Katuwapitiya.\n\n=== Subsequent events ===\n\nOn 26 April, the Sri Lanka Army and the STF carried out a search operation in Sainthamaruthu where three explosions and a shootout occurred when they attempted to raid a suspected hideout following a tip-off. Three suicide bombers blew themselves up, killing nine of their family members, including three women and six children, while three other terrorists were shot dead by the soldiers. One civilian was caught in the crossfire and died, according to police, while a wounded woman and child were taken to hospital.\n\nAnother search operation in Sammanthurai based on information received by the State Intelligence Service led to a house where a stock of more than 150 gelignite sticks, IS uniforms and flags, 100,000 metal balls, a drone, a van and a laptop were discovered. An indefinite curfew was imposed in the police areas of Kalmunai, Chawalakade and Sammanthurai.\n\nAs a result of the raids and arrests a second wave of planned attacks targeting several churches, opposing mosques and the Temple of the Tooth were averted\n\nOn the same day, a suspect was arrested and more than 40 swords, kris knives and several uniforms similar to those worn by the army were recovered from a mosque at Palliyaweediya on Slave Island.\n\nOn 27 April, while conducting house to house raids in the Kalmunai area, evidence recovered linked three suspects to the murders of two police officers, Dinesh Alagaratnam and Niroshan Indika, on 29 November 2018 in Vavunathivu. All three suspects have been arrested and The Daily Mirror reported that sources confirmed they were part of a \"radical Islamist\" group.\n\nOn the same day, the driver of the main suspect involved in the attacks, Mohamed Sahran, was arrested in Kattankudy. The Negombo Deputy Mayor, Mohomad Anzar, was taken into custody with a sword, a knife and 38 mobile phone batteries.\n\n== Government response ==\n\n\n=== Precautionary measures ===\n==== State of emergency ====\nFollowing President Sirisena's return to the island from Singapore on 22 April 2019, where he was on a personal visit, the Sri Lankan government declared a state of emergency from midnight of 22 April by an extraordinary gazette notification issued by the President under the Public Security Ordinance. This would give the government, police and the armed forces sweeping powers to undertake counter terrorism activities. The government also announced that it would hold a national day of mourning the following day. On 24 April, the Sri Lankan Parliament passed emergency regulations without a vote after a day-long debate. Emergency regulations give the police and armed forces powers to search, arrest and detain persons up to 24 hours without a warrant.\n\nOn 25 August 2019, the government lifted the state of emergency, following the normalising of the security situation.\n\n==== Curfews ====\n\nSince 21 April evening, the government has imposed nightly police curfews effective island-wide, with the hours reduced to 2200 to 0400 hours until 27 April. Indefinite curfews were imposed in several police divisions where incidents such as the Sainthamaruthu shootout took place.\n\nOn 12 May, a group of people congregated in the town of Chilaw allegedly following a Facebook post which claimed there was a plan to attack the town. An immediate police curfew was imposed and the situation was brought under control without further damage. Two people were later arrested over the incident.\n\nOn 13 May, sporadic isolated incidents where groups of people vandalised property in the North Western Province caused police to impose curfew across the entire country. Acting Police Chief C.D. Wickramaratne promised an overwhelming police response against any individuals breaking the law by instigating sporadic countrywide riots targeting Muslim-owned property and businesses. In a hard-hitting statement, Army Commander Mahesh Senanayake stated that the security forces had been given broad-ranging powers under emergency laws, and would respond proportionately to the threat, but that they would not hesitate to utilise the full extent of their powers to ensure that the rule of law is maintained.\n\nOn 14 May, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that all necessary powers to restore peace and stability to the country had been given to security forces and police. He further stated that creating unnecessary disturbances would hinder the ongoing investigations to apprehend terrorists.\n\n\n==== Ban on social media ====\nThe government temporarily blocked major social media networks and messaging services Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Viber, Snapchat and YouTube within hours of the attack. The blocking included VPN service providers that could be used to circumvent the blocks.\n\nSome commentators condoned the move and viewed it as evidence that social media sites had failed to stop misinformation. Others criticised the block for cutting off Sri Lankans from means of communicating with relatives during a disaster and saw it as counterproductive in reducing fake news.\n\nOn 30 April, President Sirisena ordered the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) to lift the social media ban. On 13 May the government blocked social media for the third time following the anti-Muslim riots.\n\n==== Ban on burqa ====\n\nOn 24 April 2019, a Sri Lankan MP called for both burqa and niqab to be banned from the country and proposed that a bill be passed in the Parliament during a local parliamentary session in wake of the attacks.\n\nOn 28 April 2019, President Sirisena banned any type of face covering that prevents or hinders facial identification, including the burqa or niq\u0101b under an emergency law which will go into force on 29 April 2019. This law does not prevent a Muslim woman from wearing a hijab or chador. Breaching any emergency law is punishable by a maximum penalty of death, a recently reinstated penalty which has not been used for more than four decades. In a press release, the President stated the decision was taken to \"further support the ongoing security and help the armed forces to easily identify the identity of any wanted perpetrators\". The All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulema also told all Muslim women not to wear face veils in public for security reasons.\n\n==== Surveillance ====\nOn 10 May 2019, it was mandated that copies of all sermons given inside mosques be submitted to the Ministry of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs, as part of a broader strategic plan to monitor activities inside mosques. The Ministry said mosques must not be used for radicalising congregations.\n\n==== Centralised and Integrated Population Information System ====\nOn 8 May 2019, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe announced plans for a centralised platform for the collection, monitoring and storage of intelligence. The system known as the Centralised and Integrated Population Information System will collect biometric data from iris scanning and facial identification at all ports of entry and exit. The Ministry of Internal Affairs, Provincial Councils and local governments were instructed to prepare an action plan for this system in two weeks, to obtain Cabinet approval.\n\n=== Investigations ===\n==== Security lapse Inquiry ====\nSri Lanka's Minister of Telecommunication Harin Fernando had tweeted that Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara sent an alert by his Deputy Inspector General Priyalal Dissanayake dated 11 April 2019 relaying an Indian intelligence report from 4 April that suicide bombers affiliated with NTJ planned to attack prominent churches and the Indian embassy in Colombo. The Indian intelligence service reissued the warnings two days and two hours before the attacks. Following the attacks, it disclosed that some of the information about the attacks was gleaned from an ISIL suspect arrested in Delhi, who revealed the name of a man, Zahran Hashim, the founder of the NTJ.\n\nAfter initial government denials of the alert's authenticity, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that \"information was there,\" about the attacks, and that his government must \"look into why adequate precautions were not taken.\" The State Defence Minister had earlier requested that the media not publish the names of the attackers, and said the government believes the attacks were carried out by a single group of religious extremists.\n\n;TID pre-bombing investigation \nIt was later claimed that the Police Terrorism Investigations Division (TID) has been investigating the activities of the chief suspect Zahran, with an arrest warrant issued by the Colombo Magistrate's Court in August 2018 based on a 'B' report dated 2 July 2018 which the TID had submitted. However, the investigation had stopped after the arrest of the head of the TID, DIG Nalaka de Silva in September 2018, on allegations of attempting to assassinate President Sirisena, which ignited the 2018 constitutional crisis.\n\n;Presidential Commission of Inquiry\nThis security lapse forms part of a current Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Easter Sunday bombings. The commission submitted an interim report two weeks after the attack and extension of its term until 31 May to complete the final report.\n\nBased on the interim report of the presidential commission, the Attorney General Dappula de Livera instructed the Criminal Investigation Department to carryout a criminal investigation against former Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando and IGP Pujith Jayasundera to determine if they failed to act on intelligence warnings about the attack. The final report was presented to President Sirisena by the commission on 10 June 2019.\n\n;Parliamentary Select Committee\nIn May, a Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) was appointed to probe the Easter Sunday terrorist attacks and incidents in its aftermath by the Speaker of the Parliament. The Select committee is headed by the Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri and includes seven MPs. The SLFP and the UPFA decided not to participate in the Select committee.\n\nOn 7 June 2019, President Sirisena called an emergency Cabinet meeting and protest the PSC probe. He ordered that the PSC be terminated. He was critical of the PSC for summering intelligence and police officers. He had ordered no public officer to appear for summons issued by the PSC. Following Chief of National Intelligence Sisira Mendis's statement at the PSC to the effect that President Sirisena knew about the warnings of an impending attack, Sirisena sacked Mendis within hours.\n\n==== Bombing investigation ====\nThe Sri Lankan Police launched an investigation into the incident; it has now transpired into a major transnational investigation led by the Criminal Investigation Department of the Sri Lankan Police to hunt down all the perpetrators involved in this incident. Six foreign police agencies, including Scotland Yard, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Interpol are assisting the Sri Lankan Police.\n\nThe bomber at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel was a guest who registered under the name of \"Mohamed Azzam Mohamed\" and gave a false address. The Shangri-La Hotel bomber was identified by police as Insan Seelavan, a factory owner, nine of whose employees have been arrested.\n\nOn 23 April 2019, three Sri Lankan government and military sources told Reuters that a Syrian national had been held in custody for questioning over the attacks.\n\nLater on 23 April, the Sri Lankan State Defence Minister, Ruwan Wijewardene, said that initial investigations have revealed that Islamic extremists \"carried out the attacks in retaliation for a March attack on two mosques in New Zealand\". This has been questioned by New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and by analysts, as the attacks were likely planned before the Christchurch attacks. New Zealand security expert Paul Buchanan said that \"Christchurch seems to be a convenient justification for something that was being planned before 15 March\". Shortly afterward, Amaq News Agency claimed ISIL inspired the attacks. It released a photo and a video showing eight suicide bombers pledging allegiance to ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Zahran Hashim of the NTJ was identified as their leader. Amaq's statements emphasised the attacks were against Christians who are war with the organisation. None of them referenced Christchurch.\n\nInvestigators believe the bombs were made of acetone peroxide, and are looking into training camps that had been hidden on a remote compound near Wanathavilluwa, on the west coast of the country, and possible links to overseas jihadist networks.\n\nAccording to the investigators, the perpetrators were offered military training by a person named Army Mohideen, while weapons training was provided overseas as well as in Nuwara Eliya and Wanathawilluwa in the Eastern Province. The vehicles used in the attack are believed to have been procured from a car sales centre in Kadawata.\n\nThe National Investigation Agency of India confirmed that on 28 April, four homes were raided in Kasaragod, and Palakkad, Kerala as part of the transnational investigation unfolding into the Easter Sunday bombings.\n\n== Perpetrators ==\n=== Arrests ===\nPolice arrested eight people living in the Colombo suburb of Dematagoda on the day of the attacks. Five more suspected attackers and accomplices were arrested at a house during the night. Police confirmed on the day after the bombings that 24 people were arrested. By 23 April, the number of people arrested was 40. Three police officers and two civilians were killed by bombs that exploded during the capturing. By 24 April 60 people had been arrested with possible links to the attacks, with 32 in custody. On 26 April, the Sri Lankan Police had more than 70 suspects held on charges of suspicion of terrorism, aiding and abetting terrorism, and conspiracy to commit terrorism. Four high-level suspects are being held by the Terrorism Investigation Department, and 33 are being held by the Criminal Investigation Department. Most of them are friends and family of the suspected suicide bombers. Nine suicide bombers were involved in the attacks, and police have identified all of them.\n\nA suspected mastermind named Hayathu Mohamed Ahmed Milhan and four others were deported to Sri Lanka from the Middle East. Milhan was expected to become the new leader of NTJ.\n\nOn 29 March 2020, the main suspect who was also the mastermind behind the Easter bombing in the Zion Church was arrested by police in Mount Lavinia during the curfew which was imposed indefinitely due to the coronavirus pandemic in the country. The suspect was identified as a 40 year old resident of Dehiwala\/Mount Lavinia and was accused of transporting the suicide bomber to the Zion Church in Batticaloa. The suspect is also alleged of handling the suicide bomber who attack the Kochikade St. Anthony Church.\n\n==== Bail controversy ====\nNine people arrested on 22 April 2019 and formally charged with supplying equipment used in connection with an act of terrorism appeared in Colombo Magistrates Court on 6 May 2019. They were released on bail of two sureties of LKR500,000 each (approx. $3,000), as the court found the case against them was weak. The police launched an investigation to determine whether Wellampitiya police had erred. On 9 May 2019, investigators found Wellampitiya police officers had made several errors, neglecting to put several facts before the court. A police spokesman said stern action would be taken against the officers responsible.\n\nOn 15 May, Wellampitiya Police officers hit back against the allegations of negligence and filed a complaint to the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) alleging Colombo Magistrate Court Judge Priyantha Liyanage was being biased against the police by releasing nine of the ten suspects produced in court. A legal representative appearing on behalf of the suspects stated that the magistrate nor his client needs to wait for the police to complete its investigations for the magistrate to make a decision on the matter, the allegations made by the Wellampitiya Police officers do not have a proper basis in law. A police spokesman said an investigation had been launched into the incident, and that it appears that police may have erred by not filing the case under the Prevention of Terrorism Act because the investigations were yet to be completed. He further stated that as soon as the report from the investigation is released, police will take actions against any personnel held responsible.\nOn April 14, 2020, Sri Lankan authorities arrested Hejaaz Hizbullah under \u201cPrevention Of Terrorism Act\u201d. He was amongst the suspects of 2019\u2019s Sunday Easter Bombings attack. Human Rights Watch urged the Sri Lankan government to ensure that the detained people have access to lawyer.\n\n=== National Thowheeth Jama'ath ===\n\nHealth Minister Rajitha Senaratne confirmed that all of the bombers were Sri Lankan citizens associated with National Thowheeth Jama'ath (NTJ), a local militant radical Islamist group, but foreign links are suspected. There had been no claim of responsibility before 23 April. NTJ's leadership had been condemned by several Sri Lankan Muslim organisations in 2016 for advocating extreme fundamentalist indoctrination of children and for clashes with Buddhist monks, and was linked in 2018 to vandalism of Buddhist statues following anti-Muslim riots in Sri Lanka. NTJ's leader and \"bombing mastermind\" Zahran Hashim from Sri Lanka, preached on a pro-ISIL Sri Lankan Facebook account, known as \"Al-Ghuraba\" media, and on YouTube.\n\n=== Jammiyathul Millathu Ibrahim ===\nDuring a press conference on 23 April 2019, State Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene confirmed that a second splinter group was being investigated, but declined to provide details. On 27 April 2019, President Sirisena designated Jammiyathul Millathu Ibrahim (the splinter group) and National Thowheeth Jama'ath as terrorist organisations. This enables the freezing and seizure of assets belonging to these groups.\n\n=== Willayath As Seylani ===\nWillayath As Seylani proscribed among NTJ and JMI under Emergency regulations of 75(1).\n\n=== Identities of the bombers ===\nWijewardene announced that most of the suicide bombers were \"well-educated and come from middle or upper-middle class\", and that they were \"financially quite independent\". He stated one of the bombers studied in the United Kingdom before going to Australia to complete a postgraduate degree.\n\nSri Lankan police have identified the nine suicide bombers:\n\n\n\n=== Ties to Islamic State ===\n\nThe attackers are assessed to have links with Islamic State of Iraq and Levant, at least in the digital sphere.\n\nHashim was featured in a video released by Amaq purporting to show eight of the suicide bombers. One of the bombers, Abdul Latheef, had tried to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State. It was reported that he was one of the subjects of a terrorism investigation by the Australian Joint Counter Terrorism Team in 2014 after intelligence emerged linking him to an IS operative Neil Prakash. British newspaper The Times has reported that security agencies believe he might have reached Syria where he was trained and had links with British ISIL members like Jihadi John and Junaid Hussain.\n\nAfter the Sainthamaruthu shootout, Amaq claimed those killed in the raid were men of ISIL and published a photo which showed Rilwan who had blown himself up. The other man in the image has been identified to be Zahran. Islamic State also released a video purportedly showing their leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi praising the attackers and claiming the attacks were revenge for the loss of Baghouz in Syria.\n\nBased on their early probe, the investigators have said that the attack was planned locally without any direct hand of Islamic State. Zahran once made his cohorts listen to a recording of a puproprted ISIS official making him the head of the Sri Lankan branch. But they believe he lied greatly to others about the extent of his contacts with the group. General Mahesh Senanayake said the attackers utilised the ideology of Islamic State so it could get the blame.\n\nRavi Seneviratne, the DIG who leads the Criminal Investigation Department, testified in July that they had no evidence of the group having a direct involvement. Seneviratne added that the NTJ was inspired by its ideology, but its members had convinced the group through Indonesian intermediaries to take responsibility two days after the attacks.\n\n== Impact ==\n=== Political ===\n\nThe Inspector General of Police, Pujith Jayasundara, came under heavy criticism, following the bombings, with the United People's Freedom Alliance urging that he resign for this total failure to prevent the bombings. Later, former Presidential candidate Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka claimed it was unfair to blame the IGP and claimed it was a conflict between the functioning of military intelligence and criminal investigators, and called for better intelligence mechanisms and security clearances to be streamlined.\n\nIn a speech delivered in parliament, former president and current opposition leader Mahinda Rajapaksa slammed the government for weakening the intelligence services over the years. He stated that in January 2015, he handed over a secure and peaceful country with a strong national security apparatus. He claimed the present government is squarely responsible for the 2019 Easter bombings, stating that on an important occasion such as Easter, representatives of the government usually attend Mass; on this occasion, no representatives were present in or near churches. He blamed the government for diluting the powers of the national security apparatus and claimed this terrorist attack would never have occurred under his administration. Additionally, the government was preparing to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act; he questioned what kind of position the government would have been in to respond to the incident had they been successful in having the Act repealed.\n\nOn 24 April 2019, President Sirisena promised major changes to the leadership of the security forces within the next 24 hours and pledged a \"complete restructure\" of the police and national security forces in the coming weeks. These changes come amidst allegations that a rift between the President and Prime Minister contributed to the failure to effectively respond to threats that undermine national security. The incident also caused a major setback for the government and for other political parties just before 2019 Sri Lankan presidential election\n\nCabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne initially attempted to implicate Gotabaya Rajapaksa for the bombings, claiming that Abdul Razik was a suicide bomber and the secretary of the NTJ that received funding from intelligence agencies during the Rajapaksa government. Razik however is the general secretary of the Ceylon Thowheed Jama\u2019ath (CTJ), one of the splinter groups from Sri Lanka Thawheed Jama\u2019ath (SLTJ) of which he was the former general secretary and is neither a member of the NTJ nor a suicide bomber. Razik challenged Rajitha to provide evidence for the allegations.\n\nPrime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe later apologised for failing to stop the attacks, issuing a statement on Twitter saying \"We take collective responsibility and apologise to our fellow citizens for our failure to protect victims of these tragic events. We pledge to rebuild our churches, revive our economy, and take all measures to prevent terrorism, with the support of the international community.\"\n\nPresident Maithripala Sirisena attempted to connect International drug syndicates to the bombings to justify his campaign to implement the death penalty to drug dealers but Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe discounted the president's claims.\n\n==== 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election ====\nIn November 2019, Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected President who campaigned on stronger security measures to prevent a re-occurrence of the Easter bombings.\n\n==== Resignations ====\n;Defence Secretary\nOn 23 April, President Sirisena announced plans to change the heads of the defence forces. On 25 April, Hemasiri Fernando, Secretary of the Ministry of Defence tendered his resignation to the President, after it was announced that President Sirisena had requested the Defence Secretary and the Inspector General of Police resign. Retired General Shantha Kottegoda was appointed to succeed Fernando as Secretary of the Ministry of Defence, while retired IGP N. K. Illangakoon was appointed adviser to the Ministry of Defence.\n\n;Inspector General of Police\nAlthough President Sirisena announced on 25 April that the Inspector General of Police, Pujith Jayasundara would be resigning, Jayasundara made no public comment. On 29 April, the IGP was sent on compulsory leave after no response was received to President Sirisena's request for his resignation. The President lacks jurisdiction to dismiss the IGP, as he was appointed by a decision by the Constitutional Council and can only be removed by a motion passed in Parliament pursuant to the Public Officers (Procedure) Act, which requires the precise circumstances of the charges and\/or allegations against him to be detailed and presented. The Police Commission still maintains jurisdiction to overturn the decision to send the IGP on compulsory leave. The same day, Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police C. D. Wickramaratne was appointed as the Acting Inspector General of Police and General Shantha Kottegoda was appointed Defence Secretary. On 13 May, the Constitutional Council endorsed the appointment of C. D. Wickramaratne as Acting IGP. This is considered final and conclusive for all purposes, as neither the National Police Commission or the Supreme Court have jurisdictional oversight to reverse this decision.\n\nPujith Jayasundara has since challenged his compulsory leave with a petition to the Supreme Court. On 2 July, the former police chief along with the former defence official were arrested according to the order by the President and the current Attorney General Dappula de Livera over the alleged security lapses which lead to the attacks. They were arrested while being hospitalised and are charged for the crimes against humanity.\n\n;Ministers and Provincial Governors \nFollowing calls for resignation of Minister of Industry and Commerce, Rishad Bathiudeen and Proven\u00e7al Governors Azath Salley and M. L. A. M. Hizbullah; including a fast carried-out by Member of Parliament, Venerable Athuraliye Rathana Thero, Governor of Western Province Azath Salley and Governor of Eastern Province M. L. A. M. Hizbullah tendered their resignations to President Sirisena on 3 June, who had appointed both in January 2019. This was followed the same day by an announcement by Rauff Hakeem, Leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress stating that all Muslim Ministers will resign from their portfolios \"to facilitate investigations to be conducted in a free and fair manner\". This included cabinet ministers Kabir Hashim, Rauff Hakeem, M.H.A. Haleem and Rishad Bathiudeen; state ministers Faizal Cassim, H. M. M. Harees, Ameer Ali Shihabdeen and Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana and Deputy Minister Abdullah Mahrooff. On 4 June, former Mayor of Colombo, A. J. M. Muzammil was appointed Governor of Western Province by President Sirisena succeeding Salley.\n\n;Chief of National Intelligence\nSisira Mendis, Chief of National Intelligence (CNI) resigned citing health reasons, on 8 June 2019, days after giving testimony that the Parliamentary Select Committee to inquire into the Easter bombings which had outraged President Sirisena. He was succeeded by Major General Jeewaka Ruwan Kulatunga as CNI.\n\n=== Economic ===\nTourism in Sri Lanka is the country's third largest foreign exchange earner and employs around 135,000 to 150,000 in the hotel industry. The industry had expected 3 million tourist arrivals and revenue of $5 billion in 2019. Due to the attack on tourists, The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka estimated a loss of $1.5 billion in tourism earnings for the year.\n\nThe government's plan to grant visa-on-arrival to visitors from 39 countries has been suspended due to the current security situation.\n\nIn early June, in a leaked confidential assessment of the economic damage by the Easter Sunday attacks, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka claimed that the loss of government revenue from indirect tax such as VAT was approximately Rupees 26 billion for the year. It cited major impact on the country's trade deficit of the balance of payments, which would be affected badly due to the negative impact on tourism. It stated further that many foreign direct investments have been postponed.\n\nDespite the downfall in number of foreign tourist arrivals following the Easter Sunday attacks, as of July 2019 Sri Lanka still continues to be the Lonely Planet's top destination for 2019. Consequently, Sri Lanka was promoted as the upper middle income earning country from being a lower middle income earning country according to the updated classification of the World Bank. The Sri Lankan hotel sector is in rebuilding process and on the verge of returning to normalcy with tourist arrivals started to increase in June faster than expected following the attacks.\n\n=== Social ===\nGovernment Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka called for the Batticaloa Campus and Islamic study centres in Beruwala, Maharagama, Tincomalee and Addalachchenai to be brought under the control and supervision of the University Grants Commission and the Education Ministry.\n\nOn 27 April 2019, Sri Lanka Cricket called off an under-19 tour of the country by the Pakistan cricket team, scheduled to take place in May, saying \"we didn't want to take any chances\".\n\nIn the wake of the attacks, thousands of Sri Lankans bought terrorism insurance.\n\nIslamic channel Peace TV, which is run by preacher and televangelist Zakir Naik, was officially banned in the country by the main satellite cable operators Dialog TV, PEO TV and Lanka Broadband Network following the attacks even before the governmental intervention.\n\n=== Legislative ===\nFollowing the attack, calls have been made to introduce legislation to prevent possible future occurrence of such attacks. The government called for the swift enactment of the proposed Counter Terrorism Act, replacing the existing Prevention of Terrorism Act.\n\n==== Regulation of madrasas ====\nThe Ministry for Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs has proposed the Madrasa Education Regulatory Act to establish a Board under the Ministry for \"regulation, registration, supervision, control and development of education within Madrasas in Sri Lanka\"\n\n==== Sharia law ====\nMinister of Home Affairs Vajira Abeywardena stated that legislation introduced between 2010 and 2015 has \"given effect to aspects of Sharia law or Islamic law\" with non-governmental organisations registering under these. He stated that these parliamentary acts will be reviewed.\n\n==== Public signage ====\nThe government has stated that the Ministry of Home Affairs will issue a circular calling for the removal of all signage displayed in the Arabic language. This follows a statement by the Prime Minister which stated that all street name boards in the island should only be in Sinhalese, Tamil and English.\n\n==== Minimum age of marriage ====\nThe Prime Minister has stated that the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act will be amended to include a minimum age of marriage of 18 years to the traditional Muslim law, which had been criticised for lacking a minimum age of marriage, resulting in underage marriages.\n\n=== Sports ===\n==== Association football ====\nThe 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign 2nd leg clash between Sri Lanka and Macau was unable to take part as the Macanese squad refused to travel to Sri Lanka amidst the concern after the Easter bombings. FIFA subsequently forfeited the match and awarded a 3\u20130 win to Sri Lanka, thus qualified the team to the second round.\n\n== Reactions ==\n=== Domestic responses ===\nLeaders of the country condemned the attacks: President Maithripala Sirisena said \"I have given instructions to take very stern action against the persons who are responsible for this conspiracy\"; the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said \"I strongly condemn the cowardly attacks on our people today\"; Opposition Leader and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa called the attacks \"absolutely barbaric\" and said that the nation will stand united as one against \"acts of terrorism\"; and Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera described the attacks as a \"well co-ordinated attempt to create murder, mayhem and anarchy\".\n\nThe Roman Catholic Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, said \"It\u2019s a very very sad day for all of us. I wish therefore to express my deepest sorrow and sympathy [...] I condemn to the utmost of my capacity this act that has caused so much death and suffering to the people.\" Following the attack, the Archbishop's House in Colombo cancelled all Catholic Easter services planned for the evening of Easter Sunday.\n\nOn 28 April 2019 a public litigation activist, Nagananda Kodituwakku, stated that the negligence leading to the attack is in violation of the Penal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code and has filed a Fundamental Rights petition directing the Attorney General to institute criminal action against the country's senior political, civil and security officials, including President Maithripala Sirisena and former President and MP Mahinda Rajapakse, for their alleged negligence over the Easter Sunday bombings.\n\n=== International responses ===\nNumerous world leaders expressed condolences and condemnation. President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani referred to the bombings as an act of genocide.\n\n\nAfter the bombings, numerous buildings around the world were illuminated in Sri Lanka's colours, some of which included the Flinders Street railway station in Melbourne, the Opera House in Sydney, the Victoria Bridge in Brisbane, the Finlandia Hall in Helsinki, the Northern Spire Bridge and Penshaw Monument in Sunderland, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the Emirates Palace, ADNOC Headquarters, Capital Gate and Marina Mall in Abu Dhabi, the City Hall in Tel Aviv, the Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg, and the Sky Tower in Auckland. The Eiffel Tower in Paris went dark as a memorial for the victims of the bombings.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange paused for a moment of silence before the opening bell on the day after the attacks. Real Madrid C.F. also had a moment of silence before the La Liga match on the night of the attacks. Candlelight vigils were held and flags were also flown at half-mast around the world including in Pakistan, Canada, Indonesia, New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\n=== Religious leaders ===\nRepresentatives and leaders of the main world religions responded with prayers and support for the victims.\n\nPope Francis pledged his closeness and solidarity after the attacks during his Urbi et Orbi address in St. Peter's Square. The following day, he urged the international community to help Sri Lanka, and called on them to condemn terrorist acts.\n\nThe Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, a 57-member state international body, strongly condemned the terrorist acts, and called for international solidarity in the fight against terrorism.\n\nCardinal Charles Maung Bo of Myanmar, the President of the Federation of Asian Bishops' Conference (FABC) and Cardinal Oswald Gracias of India, the President of Catholic Bishops Conference of India (CBCI) also condemned the attacks.\n\nThe World Council of Churches, an ecumenical body representing several major Christian traditions, expressed sentiments of solidarity with the Christians of Sri Lanka.\n\nCondolences for the those affected and condemnations of the attacks were variously offered by the leaders of Anglican, Latter-day Saint, Methodist, Orthodox, Evangelical, and Reformed churches, as well as Muslim and Jewish congregations.\n\nAll Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama, a council of Muslim theologians, sent condolences. Several theologians met with Malcolm Ranjith, the Archbishop of Colombo, following the attacks. The National Shoora Council, composed of eighteen Muslim organisations, also expressed condolences.\n\nOn 28 May 2019, a mosque belonging to the NTJ was intentionally destroyed by the Muslim civilians in the Kekirawa community, which included the chief of a neighbouring mosque. The structure was purportedly built using foreign funds.\n\n== See also ==\n* 1971 JVP insurrection, an armed revolt in Sri Lanka following the disbanding of the state intelligence agency.\n* List of

{"title":"7 August 2019 Kabul bombing","article":"A suicide car bomb exploded at a security checkpoint outside a police station in the Afghanistan capital, Kabul, on 7 August 2019. The explosion occurred in the early morning, in a predominantly Shia neighbourhood in western Kabul. At least 14 people were killed and 145 injured, mostly civilians. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, citing that one of their suicide bombers attacked \"a recruitment centre\". The attack occurred as ongoing negotiations between the Taliban and the United States were being conducted.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the September 11 attacks, the United States requested that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden, the leader of the terrorist group Al-Qaeda. After the Taliban refused, the US and other nations invaded Afghanistan. The Taliban still has control over 59 districts.\n\nOver the years, the US has negotiated with the Taliban to end the war, with a likely solution that involves the withdrawal of US troops before the 2020 US presidential election being proposed in July and August 2019. Despite these ongoing peace negotiations, the Taliban has targeted civilians that would participate in the 2019 Afghan presidential election  in various attacks carried out in the first half of 2019. The group has threatened to disrupt the elections on August 6, calling the elections \"worthless\" because they have no legitimacy.\n\nThis is not the first time in which a police station was targeted. In April 2019, a large attack was carried out by the Taliban in western Afghanistan in which 30 soldiers and police officers were killed. A similar event occurred on July 27, 2019, when a suicide bomb near a police headquarters in Ghazni Province killed three police officers and wounded 12. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan has stated that the month of July 2019 was the deadliest in Afghanistan since May 2017 due to a rise in civilian casualties.\n\nThe military training school that was targeted also served as a recruitment center for security forces.\n\n==Attack==\nThe bomb was detonated around 9:00 am AFT on August 7, 2019, when a vehicle targeted the gates of District 6 police headquarters. The vehicle was stopped at a security checkpoint outside the building. The police headquarters was located in Golaee Dawa Khana, a Shi\u2019ite neighborhood. The police headquarters and a military training school were the main targets. The explosion left thick smoke in the sky and formed a large crater. The police station, a nearby military training school, and all windows in a radius of a mile were destroyed.\n\nThe explosion left 14 people dead, including four police officers, and 145 wounded, mostly women and children; 92 of the wounded were civilians. Two of the attackers were killed, however one was arrested. The bomb used has been identified as a car bomb, with the Taliban claiming that a larger truck bomb was used instead. The attack occurred days before the Islamic holiday of Eid Al Adha.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfghan chief executive Abdullah Abdullah condemned the attack, stating that it was aimed at disrupting the upcoming Afghan presidential elections.

{"title":"2019 Medan suicide bombing","article":"A suicide bombing was conducted in Medan, North Sumatra, Indonesia on 13 November 2019, targeting the city's metropolitan police (Polrestabes) headquarters. No person other than the attacker was killed in the attack, though six others were injured. The single attacker was affiliated with the Jamaah Ansharut Daulah.\n\n==Bombing==\nThe attack on the Medan Police's headquarters occurred on 13 November 2019, at around 8:40 AM, shortly after the conclusion of a routine morning roll call by the police officers. The explosion occurred within the grounds of the headquarters but outside the building itself. According to reports, the attacker had blended in with a group queueing to obtain certificates of good conduct before detonating the bomb in the parking lot. Other eyewitness accounts reported the attacker wearing a jacket and backpack, and that he had attempted to rush through police examination at the building's entrance.\n\nThe attacker was initially believed to be a lone wolf, and the explosion injured four police officers and two civilians aside from killing the attacker. In the aftermath of the explosion, police recovered the attacker's body parts, nails, and parts of the explosive device.\n\n==Perpetrator==\nThough his body was blown up, the perpetrator was identified from fingerprints as a 24-year old resident of the city, Rabbial Muslim Nasution, who had recently been an online motorcycle driver. Initial investigations explored Nasution's connections with the Islamic State-affiliated Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), and several of his family members were questioned by police. His body was buried in the city, despite objections. According to his parents-in-law, Nasution had shown a significant change in behavior in the six months leading up to the suicide attack, which police officials linked to indoctrination by a cleric, who was being sought after by Polri.\n\nPolice later reported that Nasution's wife had planned another terror attack in Bali, and she was arrested. Following further investigations, the Indonesian Police (Polri) stated that the JAD was behind the attack.\n\n==Reactions==\nFollowing the attack, Polri launched several raids in parts of the country, and a week after the attack reported that 74 terror suspects had been apprehended - more than half of which were arrested outside North Sumatra. The Densus 88 shot dead two alleged bomb assemblers following an ambush in Deli Serdang Regency. Some of the suspects were known to have been attending training camps in Karo Regency, and weapons including improvised firearms, airsoft guns, traditional blades, and bows were confiscated.\n\nPresident of Indonesia Joko Widodo ordered for the perpetrators of the attack to be investigated and apprehended. Deputy Speaker of the People's Consultative Assembly Zulkifli Hasan commented that Polri had been caught off guard by the attack, as with the attack on security minister Wiranto.\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/indonesia\/indonesia-50400368","https:\/\/nasional.kompas.com\/read\/2019\/11\/13\/12054511\/kronologi-ledakan-bom-bunuh-diri-di-polrestabes-medan?page=all","https:\/\/www.thejakartapost.com\/news\/2019\/11\/13\/24-year-old-man-behind-suicide-bombing-at-medan-police-hq-police-confirm.html","https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2019\/11\/suspected-suicide-bombing-targets-police-hq-indonesia-medan-191113024852686.html","https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/news\/asia\/medan-suicide-bomb-suspect-lone-wolf-indonesia-police-12090202","https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/news\/asia\/medan-police-headquarters-suicide-bombing-6-injured-12089042","https:\/\/en.antaranews.com\/news\/136583\/six-month-brainwashing-in-run-up-to-suicide-bombing-in-medan-police","https:\/\/en.antaranews.com\/news\/136783\/medan-terror-suspects-pledge-allegiance-to-is","https:\/\/7news.com.au\/news\/bali\/wife-of-medan-police-station-suicide-bomber-was-planning-a-terrorist-attack-in-bali-c-558840","https:\/\/www.thejakartapost.com\/news\/2019\/11\/19\/is-linked-group-behind-medan-attack-plans-to-form-own-country-police-say.html","https:\/\/en.antaranews.com\/news\/136908\/74-terror-suspects-under-detention-after-medan-bombing-police-chief","https:\/\/www.thejakartapost.com\/news\/2019\/11\/17\/two-alleged-assemblers-of-bomb-in-medan-blast-shot-dead-in-deli-serdang.html","https:\/\/news.detik.com\/berita\/d-4788537\/tersangka-bom-medan-berlatih-di-karo-senjata-rakitan-sangkur-disita","https:\/\/www.cnnindonesia.com\/nasional\/20191113172623-20-448061\/jokowi-minta-jaringan-teror-bom-medan-ditangkap","https:\/\/news.detik.com\/berita\/d-4784231\/soal-bom-medan-zulkifli-hasan-kita-beberapa-kali-kecolongan"]}

{"title":"2019 Manbij bombing","article":"The Manbij bombing occurred on 16 January 2019 when a suicide bomber targeted a busy market street in Manbij known to be frequented by American soldiers. \n\n\n==Background==\nIn the Syrian Civil War, the city of Manbij was taken by the Free Syrian Army in 2012, and then by ISIS in 2014. In 2016, the city was taken by the American-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in the Manbij offensive.\n\nThe Palace of the Princes restaurant was popular with Americans, located on a crowded downtown street in Manbij. U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham and Jeanne Shaheen ate there when they visited Syria in July 2018.\n\n==The attack==\nSeveral American military personnel were inside the Palace of Princes restaurant when a suicide bomber triggered an explosion outside the restaurant around midday on Wednesday, 16 January 2019. The bomber mixed into a crowd of people visiting a nearby vegetable market and detonated his explosive vest near the restaurant entrance, igniting a fireball that left the dead and wounded scattered in the street. Rescue workers rushed the wounded to the hospital, and military helicopters landed on a nearby soccer field to take the dead and wounded Americans.\n\n==Casualties==\nThe Department of Defense released a statement on 18 January 2019, identifying their three employees: a soldier, a sailor, and an intelligence expert. Defense contractor Valiant Integrated Services identified one of their employees as the fourth American killed. The four deceased Americans were:\n* Army Chief Warrant Officer 2 Jonathan R.

{"title":"2019 Khash\u2013Zahedan suicide bombing","article":"On February 13, 2019, a suicide bombing on the Khash\u2013Zahedan road in Sistan and Baluchestan Province of Iran killed at least 27 Revolutionary Guards and wounded another 13. It was one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Iran in years. The Salafi jihadist militant organization Jaish ul-Adl (\"Army of Justice\") said it carried out the bombing.\n\n== Bombing ==\nThe bomber targeted a bus transporting military personnel on the Khash\u2013Zahedan road (Road 95) in Sistan and Baluchestan province, near the border with Pakistan. The area is a refuge for militant separatist groups and drug smugglers. The bomber detonated a car full of explosives near the bus, killing 27 Revolutionary Guards and injuring 13. The soldiers were coming back to their cities after carrying out the border mission by the bus.\n\nJaish al-Adl, a group connected to Al-Qaeda and involved in some of the recent terrorist activities in southeast Iran took responsibility for the suicide bombing. In October 2018, 11 Iranian border Guards were kidnapped by the group, only 5 of them were released.\n\nThe Senior Revolutionary Guards commander of Iran said that the suicide bomber was a Pakistani national and one other member of the militant cell that planned the attack was also Pakistani. Furthermore, he claimed that three other members of militant cells were Iranian nationals from Sistan and Baluchestan. Out of those three Iranians, two were arrested.\n\n== Reactions ==\nAli Khamenei, Supreme Leader of Iran declared that \"It is evidently certain that the perpetrators of this crime are connected to the intelligence services of some of the countries inside as well as outside the region\". Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani vowed revenge against Jaish Al-Adl.\n\nIran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with India's External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and referring to both the 2019 Khash\u2013Zahedan suicide bombing and the 2019 Pulwama attack, he stated: \"Iran and India suffered from two heinous terrorist attacks in the past few days resulted in big casualties. Today in my meeting with Sushma Swaraj the Indian FM, when she had a stopover in Tehran, we agreed on close cooperation to combat terrorism in the region. Enough is enough!\"\n\n===Against Pkistan===\nIranian Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari asked Pakistan to conduct crack down against armed group Jaish al-Adl before Tehran \"takes it revenge.\" Pakistan offered Iran cooperation in investigating the bombing, and expressed sympathy for the victims of the attack. A Pakistani delegation was due to travel to Iran.\n\nBahram Qassemi, Iran Foreign Ministry spokesman declared \"Tehran will avenge the attack\" and said it would not tolerate what it saw as Pakistan's \"inability to stop cross-border attacks in Iran\". Ali Larijani, Iran's parliament speaker blamed Pakistan for the attack, saying that the attack was \"planned and carried out from inside Pakistan\". Muhammad Beghari, the military commander of Iran, told Pakistan to \"either confront the terrorist groups or allow Iranian forces in\".\n\n== Mourning ==\nThe mourning for the victims was held one day after the attack in Isfahan, Iran. The bodies of the victims were flown to Isfahan where press representatives and the affected families were waiting. The mourning ceremony was widely covered by media in Iran and the interview with families of the victims went viral in Iranian social media.\n\n== See also ==\n*2010 Zahedan bombings\n*2009 Zahedan bombing\n*2007 Zahedan bombings\n*Ahvaz military parade attack\n*Sistan and Baluchestan insurgency\n\n== References ==","urls":["https:\/\/www.tasnimnews.com\/fa\/news\/1397\/11\/24\/1946776\/","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-middle-east-47231959","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/02\/13\/world\/middleeast\/iran-bombing.html","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/middle_east\/report-at-least-20-guard-personnel-killed-in-iran-bombing\/2019\/02\/13\/947b8336-2fa8-11e9-8781-763619f12cb4_story.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190214122554\/https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/middle_east\/report-at-least-20-guard-personnel-killed-in-iran-bombing\/2019\/02\/13\/947b8336-2fa8-11e9-8781-763619f12cb4_story.html","https:\/\/www.presstv.com\/Detail\/2019\/02\/13\/588504\/Iran-IRGC-attack-Zarif-Warsaw-summit-US","https:\/\/www.euronews.com\/2019\/02\/19\/suicide-bomber-who-killed-27-members-of-irans-guards-was-pakistani-guards-commander","https:\/\/en.radiofarda.com\/a\/iran-revolutionary-guards-commander-says-suicide-bomber-pakistani\/29778561.html","http:\/\/english.khamenei.ir\/news\/6416\/Ayatollah-Khamenei-s-message-on-martyrdom-of-a-group-of-revolution","https:\/\/www.timesofisrael.com\/rouhani-claims-israel-us-behind-deadly-suicide-bombing-in-iran\/","https:\/\/www.presstv.com\/Detail\/2019\/02\/13\/588504\/Iran-IRGC-attack-Zarif-Warsaw-summit-US","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/middle_east\/the-latest-iran-says-sunni-group-bombed-elite-forces-bus\/2019\/02\/13\/56aefe2e-2fb3-11e9-8781-763619f12cb4_story.html","https:\/\/www.indiatoday.in\/world\/story\/enough-is-enough-says-iran-s-deputy-foreign-minister-during-meet-with-sushma-swaraj-on-terrorism-1457980-2019-02-17","https:\/\/www.timesofisrael.com\/after-blaming-israel-and-gulf-iran-now-fingers-pakistan-over-deadly-bus-attack\/","https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2019\/02\/iran-warns-pakistan-crack-jaish-al-adl-190216071021469.html","https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1464488","https:\/\/www.presstv.com\/Detail\/2019\/02\/13\/588488\/Iran-IRGC-Zaheda-roadside-bombing","https:\/\/www.nayadaur.tv\/2019\/02\/either-confront-terrorist-groups-or-allow-iranian-forces-to-enter-iran-threatens-pakistan","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/middle_east\/iran-points-to-pakistan-after-deadly-attack-on-guard\/2019\/02\/17\/fd894eb4-3299-11e9-8375-e3dcf6b68558_story.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190217163757\/https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/middle_east\/iran-points-to-pakistan-after-deadly-attack-on-guard\/2019\/02\/17\/fd894eb4-3299-11e9-8375-e3dcf6b68558_story.html","https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lUtPwjam824"]}

{"title":"2019 Konduga bombings","article":"On the evening of 16 June 2019, three suicide bombers detonated their explosives in Konduga village in Borno State, Nigeria, killing 30 people and wounding over 40. The first bomber targeted football fans who were watching a game on television in the hall. He was blocked from entering the hall by the owner. A heated argument ensued, during which the bomber detonated his explosives. This attack was the most deadly suicide bombing in 2019 in Nigeria. Soon after, the other two - both of whom were female - blew themselves up nearby. \n\nKonduga had suffered previous attacks, including massacres in January 2014 and in February 2014, a triple suicide bombing in February 2018 and a suicide bombing at a mosque in July 2018. \n\nOn 27 July 2019, a group returning from a funeral in Nganzai, Borno State, were the victims of a mass shooting. At least 65 people were killed.

{"title":"17 August 2019 Kabul bombing","article":"On 17 August 2019, a suicide bombing took place during a wedding in a wedding hall in Kabul, Afghanistan. At least 92 people were killed in the attack and over 140 injured. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for the bombing, stating that the attack targeted the Shi'ites. More than 1,000 people were gathered for the wedding when the attack took place. The attack occurred a day before the 100th Afghan Independence Day, causing the government to postpone the planned celebrations taking place at the Darul Aman Palace. It was the deadliest attack in Kabul since January 2018.\n\n== Attack ==\nThe suicide bombing occurred at approximately 10:40\u00a0p.m. Afghanistan Time (UTC+04:30) in western Kabul, in an area heavily populated by the Shia Hazara minority, inside the \"Dubai City\" wedding hall. The suicide bomber detonated the explosives in the men's section of the wedding hall, near the stage where musicians were playing, at a time when hundreds were inside the building for a wedding ceremony. The bomber detonated a suicide vest packed with ball bearings.\n\nThe explosion occurred shortly before the wedding ceremony was supposed to start. According to the wedding hall's owner, more than 1,200 people had been invited to the event, with a mixed group of Shi'ites and Sunnis attending. Most of the attendees were ethnic Hazaras. Both the bride and the groom were Shi'ite, and both from modest working class families, with the groom working as a tailor. Their families had discussed how to schedule the timing of the wedding to try to minimize the risk of an attack.\n\nAt least 63 people were initially killed and 182 injured. While the bride and groom survived, both lost several family members. Many children were also among those killed. 17 more people succumbed to their injuries in the days after the attack, bringing the death toll to 80. The final death toll was put at 92.\n\n== Responsibility ==\nThe day after the attack, a local affiliate of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS, the Islamic State, or Daesh) claimed responsibility for the attack. The statement of responsibility claimed that after the suicide bombing inside the wedding hall, a car bomb was also detonated outside as emergency vehicles were arriving. The follow-up car bombing has not been confirmed by the authorities.\n\nThe Taliban denied responsibility for the attack, with a spokesman stating that the Taliban \"condemns [the bombing] in the strongest terms\".\n\n== Reactions ==\n=== Domestic ===\nPresident of Afghanistan Ashraf Ghani condemned the \"inhumane\" and \"barbaric\" attack and expressed his condolences towards the victims and the families of the dead victims, and declared a day of mourning. He also stated that the Taliban can not fully escape blame for the attack either, saying that \"The Taliban cannot absolve themselves of blame for they provide platform for terrorists.\"\n\nThe Taliban denied responsibility for the attack and condemned it. The group's spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid said in a statement that the group \"strongly condemns explosion targeting civilians inside a hotel in Kabul city,\" while also adding that \"Such barbaric deliberate attacks against civilians including women and children are forbidden and unjustifiable.\"\n\n=== International ===\n* \u2013 The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) released a statement condemning the attack, stating that \"The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) condemns last night's Kabul attack that initial reports indicate killed scores of civilians and injured many more, among them women and children.\"\n* India \u2013\u00a0The Indian Ministry of External Affairs condemned the attack in an official statement, stating that \"India strongly condemns the horrific bombing in Kabul yesterday at a wedding hall in which innocent civilians lost their lives.

The statement articulated the \"firm position\" of the Korean government that \"terrorism is an act against humanity that cannot be justified under any circumstances and must be eradicated at any cost.\"\n* Turkey \u2013\u00a0The Turkish Interior Ministry expressed \"great sorrow\" over the bombing and strongly condemned \"this inhuman terrorist attack which targeted innocent people and wish Allah's mercy upon those who lost their lives, speedy recovery to the wounded, and convey our condolences to the friendly Government and the brotherly people of Afghanistan\".\n* \u2013 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the UAE, in a statement, condemned the attack which took place in Kabul and reaffirmed its support to the Afghan Government in their fight against terrorism.\n* \u2013 U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, condemned the attack.

{"title":"December 2019 Mogadishu bombing","article":"On 28 December 2019, a suicide truck bomber killed at least 85 people at the Ex-Control Afgoye police checkpoint in Mogadishu, Somalia. More than 140 others were wounded and, as of 31 December, 12 people remained missing. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack on 30 December. The attack was the deadliest in Somalia since the 14 October 2017 Mogadishu bombings, which killed 587 people.\n\n== Attack ==\nThe attack occurred at a busy intersection on the western outskirts of Mogadishu, at a police checkpoint during local rush hour. The major intersection connects Mogadishu with the rest of southern and southwestern Somalia. The Ex-Control Afgoye checkpoint is located near a tax office, and is used by vehicles entering Mogadishu from nearby Afgooye town.\n\nThe truck bomb explosion caused massive damage to the surrounding area, and left many of the dead burned beyond recognition. At least 15 of those killed were university students returning to class at Benadir University, whose minibus was demolished in the explosion. Two Turkish engineers, who were constructing a road from the checkpoint into the city, were also killed in the bombing. Many others were wounded. Fifteen critically injured people, including an eight month old baby, were airlifted to Istanbul, Turkey for further medical treatment; thirty other critically injured people received medical treatment in Qatar and other neighboring countries.\n\nSomali Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire announced the establishment of a national response committee to help the injured and offer support to those who lost family members in the attack.\n\n== Responsibility and aftermath ==\nInitially, no group claimed responsibility for the attack. On 30 December, two days after the attack, radical Islamist group Al-Shabaab, which had carried out previous suicide attacks in Mogadishu, claimed responsibility. Through spokesman Ali Mohamud Rageh (also known as Ali Dhere), the group stated that they targeted a convoy of Turkish and Somali forces in the attack, noting that they \"inflicted heavy losses on the Turks and the apostate militias who were protecting them.\"\n\nSomalia's National Intelligence and Security Agency (NISA) stated that a foreign country helped organize the attack, issuing a statement that, \"We have submitted to the national leaders a preliminary report indicating that the massacre against the Somali people in Mogadishu on 28 December 2019 was planned by a foreign country. To complete the ongoing investigation we will seek cooperation from some of the international intelligence agencies.\" However, the statement did not name the country suspected to be involved or provide additional evidence. \n\nThe Somali government, in coordination with U.S. Africa Command, conducted three retaliatory airstrikes targeting Al-Shabaab leaders in the Lower Shabelle region after the attack. The airstrikes, in the villages of Kunyo Barrow and Aliyow Barrow, killed four militants and destroyed two vehicles.\n\n== References ==","urls":["https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/12\/28\/world\/africa\/somalia-explosion-mogadishu.html","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-somalia-blast\/al-qaeda-ally-claims-responsibility-for-somalia-blast-that-killed-90-people-idUSKBN1YY16C","https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2019\/12\/28\/africa\/somalia-unrest-bombing-intl\/index.html","https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2019-12-28\/eight-people-die-many-injured-as-car-bomb-explodes-in-mogadishu","https:\/\/www.aa.com.tr\/en\/africa\/turkey-offers-condolence-to-somalia-over-terror-attack\/1687084","http:\/\/www.xinhuanet.com\/english\/2019-12\/29\/c_138664516.htm","http:\/\/www.xinhuanet.com\/english\/2019-12\/30\/c_138667291.htm","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2019\/dec\/28\/truck-bomb-kills-scores-in-mogadishu-somalia-capital","https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2019\/12\/31\/africa\/somalia-truck-bombing-alshabaab\/index.html","https:\/\/www.voanews.com\/africa\/al-shabab-claims-responsibility-deadly-bombing-somali-capital"]}

{"title":"May 2020 Afghanistan attacks","article":"In May 2020, a series of insurgent attacks took place in Afghanistan, starting when the Taliban killed 20 Afghan soldiers and wounded 29 others in Zari, Balkh and Grishk, Helmand on 1 and 3 May, respectively. On 12 May, a hospital's maternity ward in Kabul and a funeral in Kuz Kunar (Khewa), Nangarhar were attacked, resulting in the deaths of 56 people and injuries of 148 others, including newborn babies, mothers, nurses, and mourners. ISIL\u2013KP claimed responsibility for the funeral bombing, but no insurgent group claimed responsibility for the hospital shooting.\n\nThe Afghan government blamed the Taliban as the main perpetrators behind the 12 May attacks, and immediately ordered the military to resume its offensives against the Taliban and other insurgent groups. The Taliban, however, denied involvement. The U.S. government said that ISIL\u2013KP conducted the 12 May attacks, not the Taliban, but this assertion was rejected by Afghan officials.\n\nThe Taliban announced that it would conduct revenge attacks against the Afghan government for blaming it for the 12 May attacks, and conducted suicide bombings in Gardez and Ghazni, which killed nine intelligence personnel and five civilians, and wounded 69 others. The Taliban then attempted to capture Kunduz, attacking several government posts in the city during which eight soldiers, four civilians, and one policeman were killed, and 73 others were injured. The Taliban attack on Kunduz was repelled by the Afghan security forces.\n\n== Background ==\nOn 29 February 2020, the U.S. signed a peace agreement with the Taliban in Qatar, which set the conditions for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. However, despite the agreement, attacks against Afghan security forces surged in the country. In the 45 days after the agreement (between 1 March and 15 April), the Taliban conducted more than 4,500 attacks in Afghanistan, which showed an increase of more than 70% as compared to the same period in the previous year. More than 900 Afghan security forces were killed in the period, up from about 520 in the same period a year earlier. Meanwhile, because of a significant reduction in the number of offensives and airstrikes by Afghan and U.S. forces against the Taliban due to the agreement, Taliban casualties dropped to 610 in the period down from about 1,660 in the same period a year earlier. The Pentagon spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, said that although the Taliban stopped conducting attacks against the U.S.-led coalition forces in Afghanistan, the violence was still \"unacceptably high\" and \"not conducive to a diplomatic solution.\"\n\n== Insurgent attacks before 12 May ==\nOn 1 May, the Taliban attacked Balkh Province's Zari District overnight, killing 13 members of the Afghan security forces and injuring 17 others. On 2 May, a motorbike bomb exploded outside the provincial prison in Mihtarlam, Laghman Province, killing three civilians and injuring four members of the security forces. Noor Mohammad, director of Laghman's provincial prison directorate, was among the injured.\n\nOn 3 May, seven Afghan security forces were killed and at least 12 others wounded in a suicide truck bomb attack on a military and intelligence base in Grishk District, Helmand Province. A Mazda mini truck was exploded in front of the gate by the suicide attacker, partially damaging the base. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. In a separate attack on 3 May, the Taliban threw a hand grenade into a mosque in Khairkot District, Paktika Province, injuring 20 worshipers who were offering the night prayer after having broken their Ramadan fast.\n\nOn 4 May, four employees of the state-owned power company, Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS), were wounded in a bomb explosion in northern Kabul when they were returning to Kabul after repairing a transmission tower destroyed by gunmen earlier. Two of the four were in critical condition. On the same day, a policewoman was assassinated in the center of Kandahar, making her the fifth policewoman to be killed during the previous two months in Kandahar. No group claimed responsibility for the killing of the policewoman. On 7 May, a roadside bomb explosion in Nadir Shah Kot District, Khost Province killed Gen. Sayed Ahmad Babazai, the Police Chief of Khost Province, his secretary, and one bodyguard, and also wounded another person. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nJust before the two 12 May attacks, there was a devastating attack in the night of 10 May, during which the Taliban attacked a convoy and security post in Alishing District, Laghman Province, northeast of Kabul. 27 Afghan soldiers were killed and several military vehicles were destroyed, while nine soldiers remained missing after the attack.\n\n== 12 May attacks ==\nAt 10 AM on 12 May 2020, three gunmen wearing police uniforms carried out a mass shooting in the maternity ward of a hospital in Kabul. The hospital is located in the predominately Shi'ite Hazara neighborhood of Dashte Barchi and is assisted by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors Without Borders) personnel. The attackers killed 24 people and injured another 16. The deaths included two newborn babies, one midwife, and 16 mothers, who were either pregnant giving birth or were with their newborns. Three of the mothers were shot and killed in the delivery room along with their unborn babies.\n\nThe gunmen had walked straight past other wards closer to the hospital's entrance, and attacked only the maternity ward. More than 80 women, infants, and staff, including three foreign nationals, were safely evacuated from the hospital, and all of the attackers were killed by the Afghan security forces and their mentoring Norwegian special forces.\n\nAccording to Frederic Bonnot, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res' head of programs in Afghanistan: \"I went back the day after the attack and what I saw in the maternity (ward) demonstrates it was a systematic shooting of the mothers. They went through the rooms in the maternity (ward), shooting women in their beds. It was methodical. Walls sprayed with bullets, blood on the floors in the rooms, vehicles burnt out and windows shot through.\" Bonnot added: \"It\u2019s shocking. We know this area has suffered attacks in the past, but no one could believe they would attack a maternity. They came to kill the mothers.\"\n\nAbout an hour after the Kabul attack, a suicide bombing took place in Kuz Kunar District (also known as Khewa District), Nangarhar Province at the funeral of Shaikh Akram, a former commander of the district's police force, who had died of a heart attack a day earlier. The blast killed 32 people and injured 133 others, some severely. Abdullah Malikzai, a member of Nangarhar's provincial council, was killed in the attack, while his father, Malik Qais Noor Agha, a lawmaker, was wounded.\n\n===Responsibility for the 12 May attacks===\nThe Afghan government blamed the Taliban for the attacks on 12 May, and immediately ordered the military to resume its offensives against the Taliban and other insurgent groups. Amrullah Saleh, the Vice President of Afghanistan, said that there was an evidence that the Taliban plotted the attacks and that the Taliban were in \"celebratory mood\" after the attacks. Saleh added: \"They double celebrate the naivete of some for accepting their lies and accusing the fictional IS-K.\" The acting interior minister, Masoud Andarabi, said: \u201cThis indicates close cooperation between the Haqqani network and the Daesh group [ISIL], and also the attack is a war crime. This shows that the Taliban do not have any commitment to the agreement they signed.\u201d\n\nThe Taliban, however, denied responsibility for the 12 May attacks. Suhail Shaheen, spokesman of the Taliban office in Qatar, claimed: \"These are extreme barbaric acts and only ISIS terrorists could show such brutality. Unfortunately, such elements are working under the cover of Afghan intelligence agencies and are carrying out false flag operations. The sole aim of such attacks is to destroy the peace agreement that was signed in Doha on February 29, 2020.\"\n\nIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant \u2013 Khorasan Province (ISIL\u2013KP) claimed responsibility for the Kuz Kunar funeral bombing in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. However, no armed group claimed responsibility for the Kabul hospital shooting.\n\nOn 15 May, the United States government said that it had assessed that ISIL\u2013KP was responsible for the 12 May attacks, rather than the Taliban. However, Afghan officials rejected this assertion, and reiterated that the Taliban and the affiliated Haqqani network were behind the attacks.\n\nThe Taliban, however, claimed responsibility for more than a dozen other deadly attacks in Afghanistan in May 2020.\n\n=== Reaction to the 12 May attacks ===\nThe Taliban denied responsibility for the 12 May attacks and called them \"heinous\". Suhail Shaheen, spokesman of the Taliban office in Qatar, claimed: \"The Taliban could not even think of attacking a maternity hospital and funeral prayers.\"\n\nInterior ministry spokesman Tariq Aryan described the Kabul hospital attack as an \"act against humanity and a war crime.\"\n\nThe UN Secretary General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, strongly condemned the 12 May attacks. While the 15-member Security Council issued a statement reaffirming \"that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.\"  The Council also emphasized that the \"heinous and cowardly terrorist attacks\" took place during Ramadan and that ISIL\u2013KP had claimed responsibility for the blast in Nangarhar.\n\nThe chief of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom, said he was \"shocked and appalled\" by the Kabul attack and said that hospitals \"should never be a target.\"\n\nDeborah Lyons, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, denounced the hospital attack, saying: \u201cWho attacks newborn babies and new mothers? Who does this? The most innocent of innocents, a baby! Why?\u201d\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned the \"horrific terrorist attacks\" and said that \u201cany attack on innocents is unforgivable, but to attack infants and women in labor in the sanctuary of a hospital is an act of sheer evil.\u201d\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Twitter that he was \"horrified by the appalling terrorist attacks in Afghanistan today - including on a maternity hospital. Targeting mothers, their newborns and medical staff is despicable.\"\n\nThe External Affairs Ministry of India released a statement condemning the 12 May attacks and calling them \"barbaric\". It added that \"Such reprehensible attacks, including on mothers, newly born children, nurses and mourning families are appalling and constitute crimes against humanity.\" and urged for the responsible to be brought to swift justice.\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International tweeted \"The unconscionable war crimes in Afghanistan today, targeting a maternity hospital and a funeral, must awaken the world to the horrors civilians continue to face\". Human Rights Watch also demanded to bring the perpetrators to justice for this \"war crime\".\n\n== Insurgent attacks after 12 May until the ceasefire ==\nOn 14 May, the Taliban carried out a retaliation attack near a court in Gardez, Paktia Province: a suicide truck bomber tried to explode himself outside a military compound, but exploded before its destination. The attack resulted in five civilians killed and at least 29 others injured. The Taliban claimed this as a revenge attack, after President Ashraf Ghani blamed the group for the attack at the maternity hospital; the Taliban denied responsibility for the hospital attack. On the same day, the Taliban also attacked a checkpoint in Firozkoh (also known as Chaghcharan), Ghor Province, killing three soldiers and taking 11 others captive. On 16 May, in an overnight attack on a security checkpoint in Paktia Province's Ahmad Aba District, the Taliban killed eight soldiers and wounded nine others. The soldiers had been providing security for a multi-purpose dam. In addition, the Taliban also abducted 12 civilians in the province's Tsamkani District, charging them for \"collaborating with the government\". Also on 16 May, a roadside bomb targeting healthcare workers in Khost exploded, injuring six civilians, including the assistant to the Khost Public Health commissioner and three doctors. All the injured were carried to Khost Civil Hospital for emergency treatment.\n\nOn 17 May, the Taliban attacked a security checkpoint near the Mes Aynak mine, the country's largest copper mine, in Mohammad Agha District, Logar Province, southeast of Kabul. Eight security guards were killed and five others wounded.\n\nOn 18 May, a suicide Humvee bomber affiliated with the Taliban killed nine intelligence personnel and injured 40 others at the National Directorate of Security (NDS) unit in Ghazni, Afghanistan, also damaging the nearby Islamic Cultural Centre. On the same day in Jaghat\u016b District, Ghazni Province, insurgents killed two police officers and three civilians on a road and set their bodies on fire. Late on 18 May, a roadside IED planted by militants in Mezana District, Zabul Province killed four civilians and injured nine others.\n\nOn 19 May, the Taliban killed one policeman and one civilian and injured 18 others in a motorbike bomb in Kunduz, Afghanistan. On the same day, the Taliban attempted to capture Kunduz, attacking several government posts but were repelled by the Afghan security forces. The Taliban were forced to flee the city, leaving ten dead bodies behind. Eight Afghan soldiers and three civilians were killed and 55 others were wounded during the Taliban attack. A clinic in the nearby Chardara District of Kunduz Province, where Taliban militants were also being treated, was partially damaged in an airstrike. \n\nAlso on 19 May, gunmen opened fire in a mosque in Charikar, Parwan Province, killing 11 worshippers and injuring 16 others when they were offering the evening prayer after breaking their Ramadan fast. The Taliban denied their involvement in the attack. At the same time, gunmen also killed three brothers and injured a child in Sabari District, Khost Province when they were returning to their home from a nearby mosque. The Taliban also denied their role in this attack. Later in the day, insurgents launched attacks on checkpoints in Khwaja Bahauddin District, Takhar Province, killing nine pro-government militiamen and wounding six others. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the latter attack.\n\n== Insurgent attacks after the ceasefire ==\nAfter the end of the three-day Eid ceasefire announced by the Taliban, which lasted from 24 to 26 May, the Taliban attacked a checkpoint in Ghorband District (also known as Syagird District), Parwan Province late in the night of 27 May. This was the first deadly attack by the Taliban after the ceasefire. They set fire to the checkpoint, which killed five Afghan troops, and shot dead two others. One other soldier was injured in the attack and two others were held captive, while one Taliban attacker was also killed. On 28 May, the Taliban killed seven policemen in Farah in an attack on a police post during which eight Taliban militants were also killed. In the early hours of 29 May, the Taliban stormed border security forces check posts in Paktia Province's Dand Aw Patan District, which lies on the border with the Kurram District of Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. 14 Afghan security personnel were killed in the attack and three others were injured. Two members of the Taliban were also killed during the attack.\n\nOn 30 May, a private bus carrying 15 employees of the Khurshid TV news station was hit by a road bomb in Kabul, killing an economic reporter, Mir Wahed Shah, a technician, Shafiq Amiri, and wounding seven other people. ISIL claimed responsibility hours after the attack, describing Khurshid TV as being \"loyal to the Afghan apostate government.\" This was the second deadly attack against the channel in less than a year. The United States, the European Union, and NATO condemned the attack.\n\nFurther attacks occurred the following month.\n\n==See also==\n*Drowning of Afghan refugees in the Hari River \u2013 by Iran's

{"title":"2020 Afrin bombing","article":"On the afternoon of 28 April 2020, a truck bombing occurred a few meters away from the governor\u2019s residence in Raju street in Afrin, Aleppo Governorate, Syria. A bomb in a tank truck was detonated at an open-air market in Souk Ali in the city centre. The attack killed at least 53 civilians (including 11 children) and 12 Turkish-backed fighters, as well as injuring over 50 others.\n\n== Responsibility ==\nThe Turkish government blamed the People's Protection Units (YPG). The Syrian Democratic Council and the commander-in-chief of the Syrian Democratic Forces, Mazloum Abdi, condemned the bombing and blamed Turkish policy, pointing out that \"gangs armed by Turkey\" had been involved in similar attacks.\n\nAccording to the German Marxist newspaper Junge Welt, the nature of the attack and recent tensions suggests a jihadist group. Clashes between jihadist militias of the Syrian National Army are regular occurrences in the Afrin and Idlib regions. Significant tensions have recently re-emerged between Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the main rebel jihadist force in Idlib, and the Turkish government. HTS has accused Ankara of treason since the Russian-Turkish ceasefire agreed in early March 2020. The week prior to the Afrin bombing, the militiamen destroyed a Turkish tank while the Turkish Air Force allegedly destroyed a HTS base by drone.\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.syriahr.com\/en\/?p=162123","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-middle-east-52454134","https:\/\/www.straitstimes.com\/world\/middle-east\/bomb-blast-kills-40-people-in-syrias-afrin","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-middle-east-52454134","https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2020\/04\/fuel-truck-bomb-blast-kills-dozens-syria-afrin-turkey-200428170837725.html","https:\/\/www.syriahr.com\/","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2020\/04\/28\/world\/middleeast\/ap-ml-syria.html","https:\/\/www.syriahr.com\/","https:\/\/mezopotamyaajansi.com\/tum-haberler\/content\/view\/94954","https:\/\/www.rudaw.net\/english\/middleeast\/syria\/29042020","https:\/\/www.jungewelt.de\/artikel\/377440.t","https:\/\/news.un.org\/en\/story\/2020\/09\/1072752"]}

{"title":"2020 Afgooye bombing","article":"On January 18, 2020, a suicide car bombing killed four and injured at least 20 others in Afgooye, approximately  from the Somali capital, Mogadishu. Most of the casualties were police officers protecting Turkish contractors building a road. The al-Qaeda-linked extremist group, al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\n== Background ==\nAl-Shabaab began as the armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), which later splintered into several smaller factions after its defeat in 2006 by Somalia's Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and the TFG's Ethiopian military allies.  \n\nThe group often carries out attacks in Somalia, especially in and around Mogadishu. It less frequently attacks other African countries which support Somalia, especially neighbouring Kenya. Al-Shabaab carries out attacks to try to undermine Somalia's central government, which is backed by the United Nations and African Union peacekeeping troops, (AMISOM). On 14 October 2017, the worst attack by the organization killed more than 500 people with two bomb explosions that targeted Somalia's capital city Mogadishu.\n\n== Turkish involvement in Somalia ==\n\nTurkey is a large donor of humanitarian aid and reconstruction to Somalia. Turkey maintained an embassy in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, until the outbreak of the Somali Civil War in 1991. During the drought of 2011, Turkey contributed over $201 million to the humanitarian relief efforts in the impacted parts of Somalia. Turkey assisted in the building of several hospitals, and helped renovate and rehabilitate the Aden Adde International Airport and the National Assembly building, among other initiatives.\n\n== Attack ==\nAl-Shabaab militants detonated a car bomb near Afgooye, which is in Lower Shabelle and is approximately  from Mogadishu. A Somali Police commander said the intended target was Turkish construction workers. The suicide bomber sped into an area where the engineers and police were having lunch. Local witnesses described  a \"massive explosion\" and \"clouds of smoke\".  The casualties were mostly police officers providing security. Following the attack, al-Shabab issued a statement, \"We are behind the martyrdom of the suicide car bomb in Afgoye\".\n\n== Reactions ==\nThe Turkish defense ministry wrote on Twitter: \"We curse and condemn in the strongest terms the bomb terror attack which targeted innocent civilians in Somalia\".\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2020\/01\/somalia-turkish-workers-wounded-deadly-al-shabab-car-bombing-200118134453840.html","https:\/\/apnews.com\/5208f57020e77221070eae371cdb2696","https:\/\/www.forces.net\/africa\/al-shabab-claims-responsibility-suicide-car-bombing-somalia","https:\/\/www.hrw.org\/report\/2008\/12\/08\/so-much-fear\/war-crimes-and-devastation-somalia","http:\/\/www.isn.ethz.ch\/pubs\/ph\/details.cfm?v21=107785&lng=en&ord61=alphanavi&ord60=publicationdate&id=55851","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-somalia-blast-toll\/death-toll-from-somalia-truck-bomb-in-october-now-at-512-probe-committee-idUSKBN1DU2IC","https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2019\/12\/al-shabaab-claims-deadly-attack-somalia-mogadishu-191231002343929.html","http:\/\/www.somaliembassytr.org\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20130820030347\/http:\/\/www.somaliembassytr.org\/","http:\/\/www.hurriyetdailynews.com\/n.php?n=turkey-raises-201-million-for-somalia-2011-08-26","http:\/\/www.nation.co.ke\/oped\/Opinion\/Why-Turkish-aid-model-is-proving-to-be-a-success-\/-\/440808\/1378016\/-\/item\/0\/-\/7rmpkt\/-\/index.html","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-somalia-blast\/car-bomb-attack-wounds-turkish-contractors-police-near-somali-capital-idUSKBN1ZH08F"]}
