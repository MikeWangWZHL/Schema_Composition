{"title":"Centennial Olympic Park bombing","article":"The Centennial Olympic Park bombing was a domestic terrorist pipe bombing attack on Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta, Georgia, on July 27 during the 1996 Summer Olympics. The blast directly killed one person and injured 111 others; another person later died of a heart attack. It was the first of four bombings committed by Eric Rudolph. Security guard Richard Jewell discovered the bomb before detonation and began clearing spectators out of the park. \n\nAfter the bombings, Jewell was initially investigated as a suspect by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and news media aggressively focused on him as the presumed culprit when he was actually innocent.  In October 1996, the FBI declared Jewell was no longer a person of interest. Following three more bombings in 1997, Rudolph was identified by the FBI as the suspect. In 2003, Rudolph was arrested, and in 2005 he agreed to plead guilty to avoid a potential death sentence. Rudolph was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for his crimes.\n\n== Bombing ==\nCentennial Olympic Park was designed as the \"town square\" of the Olympics, and thousands of spectators had gathered for a late concert by the band Jack Mack and the Heart Attack. Sometime after midnight, Rudolph planted a green U.S. military ALICE pack (field pack) containing three pipe bombs surrounded by  masonry nails, which caused most of the human injuries, underneath a bench near the base of a concert sound tower. He then left the area. \n\nThe pack had a directed charge and could have done more damage but it was slightly moved at some point. It used a steel plate as a directional device. Investigators later tied the Sandy Springs and Otherside bombs together with this first device because all were propelled by nitroglycerin dynamite, used an alarm clock and Rubbermaid containers, and contained steel plates.\n\nFBI Agent David (Woody) Johnson received notice that a call to 911 was placed about 18 minutes before the bomb detonated warning that a bomb would go off at the park within 30 minutes by \"a white male with an indistinguishable American accent\".\n\nSecurity guard Richard Jewell discovered the bag underneath a bench and alerted Georgia Bureau of Investigation officers. Tom Davis, of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, called in a bomb squad, including members of the ATF and FBI to investigate the suspicious bag, which was leaning against the 40-ft NBC sound tower. Jewell and other security guards began clearing the immediate area so that the bomb squad could investigate the suspicious package.  The bomb detonated two to three minutes into the evacuation, before all spectators could leave the area.\n\nVideo of the explosion from a short distance away was captured by Robert Gee, a tourist from California, and later aired by CNN. The sound of the explosion was also recorded by a news crew from the German public television network ARD, who were interviewing American swimmer Janet Evans at a nearby hotel.\n\n=== Victims ===\nAlice Hawthorne, 44, of Albany, Georgia, was killed in the explosion when a nail from the bomb penetrated her skull.  A Turkish cameraman of Turkish Radio and Television Corporation, Melih Uzunyol, 40, had a fatal heart attack while running to the scene.  The bomb wounded 111 others.\n\n== Reaction ==\n\nPresident Bill Clinton denounced the explosion as an \"evil act of terror\" and vowed to do everything possible to track down and punish those responsible.\n\nDespite the event, officials and athletes agreed that the games should continue as planned.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n=== Richard Jewell falsely implicated ===\n\nThough Richard Jewell was hailed as a hero for his role in discovering the bomb and moving spectators to safety, news organizations later reported that Jewell was considered a potential suspect in the bombing, four days afterward, and shortly after a brief, mistaken detainment of two juvenile persons of interest at the Kensington MARTA station. Jewell, at the time, was unknown to authorities, and a lone wolf profile made sense to FBI investigators after they were contacted by his former employer at Piedmont College.\n\nJewell was named as a person of interest, although he was never arrested. Jewell's home was searched, his background exhaustively investigated, and he became the subject of intense media interest and surveillance, including a media siege of his home. \n\nAfter Jewell was exonerated, he initiated defamation lawsuits against NBC News, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and other media entities, and insisted on a formal apology from them. Jewell's lawsuit accused Piedmont College President Raymond Cleere of falsely describing Jewell as a \"badge-wearing zealot\" who \"would write epic police reports for minor infractions\". The cases were later settled after 15 years of litigation with the Georgia Court of Appeals decision in July 2012, that the newspapers accurately reported that Jewell was the key suspect in the bombing, and emphasized he was only a suspect and the potential issues in the law enforcement case against him. Richard Jewell himself died on August 29, 2007, at the age of 44 from serious medical problems related to diabetes.\n\nRichard Jewell, a biographical drama film, was released in the United States on December 13, 2019. The film was directed and produced by Clint Eastwood. It was written by Billy Ray, based on the 1997 article \"American Nightmare,\" and the book The Suspect: An Olympic Bombing, the FBI, the Media, and Richard Jewell, the Man Caught in the Middle (2019) by Kent Alexander and Kevin Salwen. Jewell is played by Paul Walter Hauser.\n\n=== Conviction of Eric Robert Rudolph ===\n\n\nAfter Jewell was cleared, the FBI admitted it had no other suspects, and the investigation made little progress until early 1997, when two more bombings took place, at an abortion clinic and a lesbian nightclub, both in the Atlanta area. Similarities in the bomb design allowed investigators to conclude that this was the work of the same perpetrator. One more bombing of an abortion clinic, this time in Birmingham, Alabama, which killed a policeman working as a security guard and seriously injured nurse Emily Lyons, gave the FBI crucial clues including a partial license plate.\n\nThe plate and other clues led the FBI to identify Eric Robert Rudolph, a carpenter and handyman, as a suspect. Rudolph eluded capture and became a fugitive; officials believed he had disappeared into the rugged southern Appalachian Mountains, familiar from his youth.  On May 5, 1998, the FBI named him as one of its ten most wanted fugitives and offered a $1 million reward for information leading directly to his arrest.  On October 14, 1998, the Department of Justice formally named Rudolph as its suspect in all four bombings.\n\nAfter more than five years on the run, Rudolph was arrested on May 31, 2003, in Murphy, North Carolina, by a rookie police officer, Jeffrey Scott Postell of the Murphy Police Department behind a Save-A-Lot store at about 4 a.m.; Postell, on routine patrol, had originally suspected a burglary in progress.\n\nOn April 8, 2005, the government announced Rudolph would plead guilty to all four bombings, including the Centennial Olympic Park attack.\n\nRudolph is serving four life terms without the possibility of parole at ADX Florence supermax prison in Florence, Colorado.\n\nRudolph's justification for the bombings according to his April 13, 2005 statement, was political:\n\n:In the summer of 1996, the world converged upon Atlanta for the Olympic Games. Under the protection and auspices of the regime in Washington, millions of people came to celebrate the ideals of global socialism. Multinational corporations spent billions of dollars, and Washington organized an army of security to protect these best of all games. Even though the conception and purpose of the so-called Olympic movement is to promote the values of global socialism, as perfectly expressed in the song Imagine by John Lennon, which was the theme of the 1996 Games even though the purpose of the Olympics is to promote these ideals, the purpose of the attack on July 27 was to confound, anger and embarrass the Washington government in the eyes of the world for its abominable sanctioning of abortion on demand.\n\n:The plan was to force the cancellation of the Games, or at least create a state of insecurity to empty the streets around the venues and thereby eat into the vast amounts of money invested.\n\nOn August 22, 2005, Rudolph, who had previously received a life sentence for the Alabama bombing, was sentenced to three concurrent terms of life imprisonment without parole for the Georgia incidents. Rudolph read a statement at his sentencing in which he apologized to the victims and families only of the Centennial Park bombing, reiterating that he was angry at the government and hoped the Olympics would be canceled. At his sentencing, fourteen other victims or relatives gave statements, including the widower of Alice Hawthorne.\n\nRudolph's former sister-in-law, Deborah Rudolph, talked about the irony of Rudolph's plea deal putting him in custody of a government he hates. \"Knowing that he's living under government control for the rest of his life, I think that's worse to him than death,\" she told the San Diego Union Tribune in 2005.\n\nAs reported in an April 8, 2013 Alabama blog post, in February 2013, LuLu.com published Rudolph's book, Between the Lines of Drift: The Memoirs of a Militant, and in April 2013 the U.S. Attorney General seized his $200 royalty to help pay off the $1 million that Rudolph owes in restitution to the State of Alabama.\n\n== See also ==\n\n*Munich massacre\n*Domestic terrorism in the United States\n*Boston Marathon bombing, another bombing at an American sporting event\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n* FBI Centennial Park Bombing page via the Wayback Machine, from December 2, 1998.\n**\" FBI Sets Up Toll-Free Information Hot-line After Atlanta Blast.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the park reopened following the bombing.\nThe suspect, Eric Rudolph shown in a photo released by the FBI.","urls":["http:\/\/legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com\/news\/nation\/20050414-0149-ericrudolph.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180902211443\/http:\/\/legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com\/news\/nation\/20050414-0149-ericrudolph.html","https:\/\/www.myajc.com\/news\/opinion\/years-later-still-lose-sleep-over-the-centennial-olympic-park-bombing-here-why\/ev1xfMrlsHtRU08v3qut6K\/","http:\/\/www.vanityfair.com\/magazine\/archive\/1997\/02\/brenner199702","http:\/\/transcripts.cnn.com\/TRANSCRIPTS\/0206\/15\/cp.00.html","http:\/\/www.orlandoweekly.com\/util\/printready.asp?id=10931","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20131212162859\/http:\/\/www2.orlandoweekly.com\/util\/printready.asp?id=10931","http:\/\/time.com\/4417773\/atlanta-olympic-bombing-1996\/","https:\/\/politics.myajc.com\/news\/local-govt--politics\/olympic-park-bombing-brought-terror-close-home\/nY5aRea9uxPKr4vOo1dy5K\/","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-srv\/national\/longterm\/bombing\/stories\/shales.htm","http:\/\/www.deseretnews.com\/article\/504589\/ONLINE-DOCUMENT--JANET-EVANS-NEARBY-DURING-CENTENNIAL-PARK-EXPLOSION.html","http:\/\/www.insidethegames.biz\/articles\/1039651\/janet-evans-to-return-to-atlanta-as-part-of-20th-anniversary-celebrations-for-1996-olympics","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1996\/07\/28\/us\/bomb-at-the-olympics-heart-ailment-kills-war-survivor-in-altanta.html","http:\/\/articles.courant.com\/1996-07-28\/news\/9607280085_1_alice-s-hawthorne-explosion-centennial-olympic-park","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/US\/9607\/27\/blast.clinton\/","http:\/\/www.highbeam.com\/doc\/1P2-712062.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20121020165009\/http:\/\/www.highbeam.com\/doc\/1P2-712062.html","https:\/\/www.ajc.com\/news\/local\/court-upholds-ruling-jewell-suit\/7T3NVagEyDY2zBM3TuV41I\/","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2007\/08\/30\/us\/30jewell.html?n=Top\/Reference\/Times%20Topics\/Subjects\/O\/Olympic%20Games","https:\/\/deadline.com\/2019\/10\/clint-eastwood-richard-jewell-world-premiere-afi-fest-1202755658\/","https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2019\/12\/12\/785587180\/sneer-campaign-richard-jewell","https:\/\/archive.vanityfair.com\/article\/share\/1fd2d7ae-10d8-474b-9bf1-d1558af697be\/","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=aYRsDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22The+Suspect:+An+Olympic+Bombing,+the+FBI,+the+Media,+and+Richard+Jewell%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjWn-m55LTmAhXFHc0KHeJCDw0Q6AEwAHoECAYQAg","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/film\/2019\/dec\/13\/richard-jewell-kathy-scruggs-olivia-wilde-irresponsible","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/12\/12\/business\/media\/richard-jewell-kathy-scruggs.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share","https:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=4600480","http:\/\/blog.al.com\/spotnews\/2013\/04\/birmingham_abortion_clinic_bom.html"]}
{"title":"2004 Madrid train bombings","article":"The 2004 Madrid train bombings (also known in Spain as 11-M) were nearly simultaneous, coordinated bombings against the Cercan\u00edas commuter train system of Madrid, Spain, on the morning of 11 March 2004 \u2013 three days before Spain's general elections. The explosions killed 193 people and injured around 2,000. The bombings constituted the deadliest terrorist attack carried out in the history of Spain and the deadliest in Europe since the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The official investigation by the Spanish judiciary found that the attacks were directed by an al-Qaeda terrorist cell, although no direct al-Qaeda participation has been established. Although they had no role in the planning or implementation, the Spanish miners who sold the explosives to the terrorists were also arrested.\n\nControversy regarding the handling and representation of the bombings by the government arose, with Spain's two main political parties\u2014Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and Partido Popular (PP)\u2014accusing each other of concealing or distorting evidence for electoral reasons. The bombings occurred three days before general elections in which incumbent Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar's PP was defeated. Immediately after the bombing, leaders of the PP claimed evidence indicating the Basque separatist organization ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna) was responsible for the bombings. Islamic extremists' responsibility would have had the opposite political effect, as it would have been seen as a consequence of the PP government taking Spain into the Iraq War, a policy extremely unpopular among Spaniards.\n\nFollowing the attacks, there were nationwide demonstrations and protests demanding that the government \"tell the truth\". The prevailing opinion of political analysts is that the Aznar administration lost the general elections as a result of the handling and representation of the terrorist attacks, rather than because of the bombings per se. Results published in The Review of Economics and Statistics by economist Jose G. Montalvo seem to suggest that indeed the bombings had important electoral impact  (turning the electoral outcome against the incumbent People's Party and handing government over to the Socialist Party, PSOE).\n\nAfter 21 months of investigation, judge Juan del Olmo tried Moroccan national Jamal Zougam, among several others, for his participation carrying out the attack. The September 2007 sentence established no known mastermind nor direct al-Qaeda link.\n\n==Description==\n\n\nDuring the peak of Madrid rush hour on the morning of Thursday, 11 March 2004, ten explosions occurred aboard four commuter trains (cercan\u00edas). The date led to the popular abbreviation of the incident as \"11-M\". All the affected trains were traveling on the same line and in the same direction between Alcal\u00e1 de Henares and the Atocha station in Madrid. It was later reported that thirteen improvised explosive devices (IEDs) had been placed on the trains. Bomb disposal teams (TEDAX) arriving at the scenes of the explosions detonated two of the remaining three IEDs in controlled explosions, but the third was not found until later in the evening, having been stored inadvertently with luggage taken from one of the trains. The following time-line of events comes from the judicial investigation.\n\nAll four trains had departed the Alcal\u00e1 de Henares station between 07:01 and 07:14. The explosions took place between 07:37 and 07:40, as described below (all timings given are in local time CET, UTC +1):\n* Atocha Station (train number 21431) \u2013 Three bombs exploded. Based on the video recording from the station security system, the first bomb exploded at 07:37, and two others exploded within 4\u00a0seconds of each other at 07:38.\n* El Pozo del T\u00edo Raimundo Station (train number 21435) \u2013 At approximately 07:38, just as the train was starting to leave the station, two bombs exploded in different carriages.\n* Santa Eugenia Station (train number 21713) \u2013 One bomb exploded at approximately 07:38.\n* Calle T\u00e9llez (train number 17305), approximately 800\u00a0meters from Atocha Station \u2013 Four bombs exploded in different carriages of the train at approximately 07:39.\n\nAt 08:00, emergency relief workers began arriving at the scenes of the bombings. The police reported numerous victims and spoke of 50 wounded and several dead. By 08:30 the emergency ambulance service, SAMUR (Servicio de Asistencia Municipal de Urgencia y Rescate), had set up a field hospital at the Daoiz y Velarde sports facility. Bystanders and local residents helped relief workers, as hospitals were told to expect the arrival of many casualties. At 08:43, firefighters reported 15 dead at El Pozo. By 09:00, the police had confirmed the death of at least 30 people \u2013 20 at El Pozo and about 10 in Santa Eugenia and Atocha. People combed the city's major hospitals in search of family members who they thought were aboard the trains. There were 193 confirmed dead victims.\n\n\n\nThe total number of victims was higher than in any other terrorist attack in Spain, far surpassing the 21 killed and 40 wounded from a 1987 bombing at a Hipercor chain supermarket in Barcelona. On that occasion, responsibility was claimed by ETA. It was Europe's worst terror attack since the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988.\n\n==Further bombings spur investigation==\n\n\nA device composed of 12 kilograms of Goma-2 ECO with a detonator and 136\u00a0meters of wire (connected to nothing) was found on the track of a high-speed railway line (AVE) on 2 April. The Spanish judiciary chose not to investigate that incident and the perpetrators remain unknown. The device used in the AVE incident was unable to explode because it lacked an initiation system.\n\nShortly after the AVE incident, police identified an apartment in Legan\u00e9s, south of Madrid, as the base of operations for the individuals suspected of being the perpetrators of the Madrid and AVE attacks. The suspected militants, headed by Jamal Zougam, Sarhane Abdelmaji \"the Tunisian\" and Jamal Ahmidan \"the Chinese\", were trapped inside the apartment by a police raid on the evening of Saturday 3 April. At 9:03\u00a0pm, when the police started to assault the premises, the militants committed suicide by setting off explosives, killing themselves and one of the police officers.\nInvestigators subsequently found that the explosives used in the Legan\u00e9s explosion were of the same type as those used in the 11 March attacks (though it had not been possible to identify a brand of dynamite from samples taken from the trains) and in the thwarted bombing of the AVE line.\n\nBased on the assumption that the militants killed at Legan\u00e9s were indeed the individuals responsible for the train bombings, the ensuing investigation focused on how they obtained their estimated 200\u00a0kg of explosives. The investigation revealed that they had been bought from a retired miner who still had access to blasting equipment.\n\n\nFive to eight suspects believed to be involved in the 11 March attacks managed to escape.\n\nIn December 2006, the newspaper ABC reported that ETA reminded Spanish Prime Minister Zapatero about 11 March 2004 as an example of what could happen unless the government considered their petitions (in reference to the 2004 electoral swing), although the source also makes it clear that ETA 'had nothing to do' with the attack itself.\n\n===Aftermath===\n\n\n\nIn France, the Vigipirate plan was upgraded to orange level. In Italy, the government declared a state of high alert.\n\nIn December 2004, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero claimed that the PP government erased all of the computer files related to the Madrid bombings, leaving only the documents on paper.\n\nOn 25 March 2005, prosecutor Olga S\u00e1nchez asserted that the bombings happened 911 days after the 11 September attacks due to the \"highly symbolic and qabbalistic charge for local Al-Qaida groups\" of choosing that day. Because 2004 was a leap year, 912 days had elapsed between 11 September 2001 and 11 March 2004.\n\nOn 27 May 2005, the Pr\u00fcm Convention, implementing inter alia the principle of availability which began to be discussed after the Madrid bombings, was signed by Germany, Spain, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium.\n\nOn 4 January 2007, El Pa\u00eds reported that Algerian Ouhnane Daoud, who is considered to be the mastermind of the 11-M bombings, has been searching for ways to return to Spain to prepare further attacks, though this has not been confirmed.\n\nOn 17 March 2008, Basel Ghalyoun, Mohamed Almallah Dabas, Abdelillah El-Fadual El-Akil and Ra\u00fal Gonz\u00e1lez Pe\u00f1a, having been previously found guilty by the Audiencia Nacional, were released after a Higher Court ruling. This court also verified the release of the Egyptian Rabei Osman al-Sayed.\n\n==Responsibility==\n\n\nOn 14 March 2004, Abu Dujana al-Afghani, a purported spokesman for al-Qaeda in Europe, appeared in a videotape claiming responsibility for the attacks.\n\nThe Spanish judiciary stated that a loose group of Moroccan, Syrian, and Algerian Muslims and two Guardia Civil and Spanish police informants were suspected of having carried out the attacks. On 11 April 2006, Judge Juan del Olmo charged 29 suspects for their involvement in the train bombings.\n\nNo evidence has been found of al-Qaeda involvement, although an al-Qaeda claim was made the day of the attacks by the Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades. U.S. officials note that this group is \"notoriously unreliable\". In August 2007, al-Qaeda claimed to be \"proud\" about the Madrid 2004 bombings.\n\nThe Independent reported that \"Those who invented the new kind of rucksack bomb used in the attacks are said to have been taught in training camps in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, under instruction from members of Morocco's radical Islamist Combat Group.\"\n\nMohamed Darif, a professor of political science at Hassan II University in Mohammedia, stated in 2004 that the history of the Moroccan Combat Group is directly tied to the rise of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. According to Darif, \"Since its inception at the end of the 1990s and until 2001, the role of the organisation was restricted to giving logistic support to al-Qaeda in Morocco, finding its members places to live, providing them with false papers, with the opportunity of marrying Moroccans and with false identities to allow them to travel to Europe. Since 11 September, however, which brought the Kingdom of Morocco in on the side of the fight against terrorism, the organisation switched strategies and opted for terrorist attacks within Morocco itself.\"\n\nScholar Rogelio Alonso said in 2007, \"the investigation had uncovered a link between the Madrid suspects and the wider world of al-Qaida\". Scott Atran said \"There isn't the slightest bit of evidence of any relationship with al-Qaida. We've been looking at it closely for years and we've been briefed by everybody under the sun... and nothing connects them.\" He provides a detailed timeline that lends credence to this view.\n\nAccording to the European Strategic Intelligence and Security Center, this is the only extremist terrorist act in the history of Europe where international Islamic extremists collaborated with non-Muslims.\n\nFormer Spanish Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar said in 2011 that Abdelhakim Belhadj, leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group and current head of the Tripoli Military Council, was suspected of complicity in the bombings.\n\n===Allegations of ETA involvement===\n \n\nImmediate reactions to the attacks in Madrid were the several press conferences held by the Spanish prime minister Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar involving ETA. The Spanish government maintained this theory for two days. Because the bombs were detonated three days before the general elections in Spain, the situation had many political interpretations. The United States also initially believed ETA was responsible, then questioning if Islamic extremists were responsible. Spain's third-largest newspaper, ABC, immediately labelled the attacks as \"ETA's bloodiest attack.\"\n\nDue to the government theory, statements issued shortly after the Madrid attacks, including from lehendakari Juan Jos\u00e9 Ibarretxe identified ETA as the prime suspect, but the group, which usually claims responsibility for its actions, denied any involvement. Later evidence strongly pointed to the involvement of extremist Islamist groups, with the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group named as a focus of investigations.\n\nAlthough ETA has a history of mounting bomb attacks in Madrid, the 11 March attacks exceeded any attack previously attempted by a European organisation. This led some experts to point out that the tactics used were more typical of militant Islamic extremist groups, perhaps with a certain link to al-Qaeda, or maybe to a new generation of ETA activists using al-Qaeda as a role model. Observers also noted that ETA customarily, but not always, issues warnings before its mass bombings and that there had been no warning for this attack. Europol director J\u00fcrgen Storbeck commented that the bombings \"could have been ETA... But we're dealing with an attack that doesn't correspond to the modus operandi they have adopted up to now\".\n\nPolitical analysts believe ETA's guilt would have strengthened the PP's chances of being re-elected, as this would have been regarded as the death throes of a terrorist organisation reduced to desperate measures by the strong anti-terrorist policy of the Aznar administration. On the other hand, an Islamic extremist attack would have been perceived as the direct result of Spain's involvement in Iraq, an unpopular war that had not been approved by the Spanish Parliament.\n\n===Investigation===\nAll of the devices are thought to have been hidden inside backpacks. The police investigated reports of three people in ski masks getting on and off the trains several times at Alcal\u00e1 de Henares between 7:00 and 7:10. A Renault Kangoo van was found parked outside the station at Alcal\u00e1 de Henares containing detonators, audio tapes with Qur'anic verses, and cell phones.\n\nThe provincial chief of TEDAX (the bomb disposal experts of the Spanish police) declared on 12 July 2004 that damage in the trains could not be caused by dynamite, but by some type of military explosive, like C3 or C4. An unnamed source from the Aznar administration claimed that the explosive used in the attacks had been Titadine (used by ETA, and intercepted on its way to Madrid 11 days before).\n\nIn March 2007, the TEDAX chief claimed that they knew that the unexploded explosive found in the Kangoo van was Goma-2 ECO the very day of the bombings. He also asserted that \"it is impossible to know\" the components of the explosives that went off in the trains \u2013 though he later asserted that it was dynamite. The Judge Javier G\u00f3mez Berm\u00fadez replied \"I cannot understand\" to these assertions.\n\n===Examination of unexploded devices===\nA radio report mentioned a plastic explosive called \"Special C\". However, the government said that the explosive found in an unexploded device, discovered among bags thought to be victims' lost luggage, was the Spanish made Goma-2 ECO. The unexploded device contained  of explosive with  of nails and screws packed around it as shrapnel. In the aftermath of the attacks, however, the chief coroner alleged that no shrapnel was found in any of the victims.\n\nGoma-2 ECO was never before used by al-Qaeda, but the explosive and the modus operandi were described by The Independent as ETA trademarks, although the Daily Telegraph came to the opposite conclusion.\n\nTwo bombs, one in Atocha and another in El Pozo stations, numbers 11 and 12, were detonated accidentally by the TEDAX. According to the provincial chief of the TEDAX, deactivated rucksacks contained some other type of explosive. The 13th bomb, which was transferred to a police station, contained dynamite, although it did not explode because it was missing two wires connecting the explosives to the detonator. That bomb used a mobile phone (Mitsubishi Trium) as a timer, requiring a SIM card to activate the alarm and thereby detonate. The analysis of the SIM card allowed the police to arrest an alleged perpetrator. On Saturday, 13 March, when three Moroccans and two Pakistani Muslims were arrested for the attacks, it was confirmed that the attacks came from an Islamic group. Only one of the five persons (the Moroccan Jamal Zougam) detained that day was finally prosecuted.\n\nThe Guardia Civil developed an extensive action plan to monitor records corresponding with the use of weapons and explosives. There were 166,000 inspections conducted throughout the country between March 2004 and November 2004. About 2,500 violations were discovered and over 3 tons of explosives, 11 kilometers of detonating cord, and over 15,000 detonators were seized.\n\n===Suicide of suspects===\n\n\nOn 3 April 2004, in Legan\u00e9s, south Madrid, four terrorists died in an apparent suicide explosion, killing one Grupo Especial de Operaciones (GEO) (Spanish special police assault unit) police officer and wounding eleven policemen. According to witnesses and media, between five and eight suspects escaped that day.\n\nSecurity forces carried out a controlled explosion of a suspicious package found near the Atocha station and subsequently deactivated the two undetonated devices on the T\u00e9llez train. A third unexploded device was later brought from the station at El Pozo to a police station in Vallecas, and became a central piece of evidence for the investigation. It appears that the El Pozo bomb failed to detonate because a cell-phone alarm used to trigger the bomb was set 12 hours late.\n\n===Conspiracy theories===\nSectors of the People's Party (PP), and certain media, such as El Mundo newspaper and the COPE radio station, continue to support theories relating the attack to a vast conspiracy to remove the governing party from power. Support for the conspiracy was also given by the Asociaci\u00f3n de V\u00edctimas del Terrorismo (AVT), Spain's largest association of victims of terrorism.\n\nThese theories speculate that ETA and members of the security forces and national and foreign (Morocco) secret services were involved in the bombings. Defenders of the claims that ETA participated in some form in the 11 March attacks have affirmed that there is circumstantial evidence linking the Islamic extremists with two ETA members who were detained while driving the outskirts of Madrid in a van containing 500\u00a0kg of explosives 11 days before the train bombings. The Madrid judge Coro Cill\u00e1n is continuing to hear conspiracy theory cases, including one accusing government officials of ordering the scrapping of the bombed train cars in order to destroy evidence.\n\n===Invasion of Iraq policy===\nThe public seemed convinced that the Madrid Bombings were a result of the Aznar government's alignment with the U.S. and its invasion of Iraq. The terrorists behind the 11-M attack were somewhat successful because of the election outcome. Before the attack, the incumbent Popular Party led the polls by 5 percent. It is believed that the Popular Party would have won the election if it had not been for the terrorist attack. The Socialist Party, led by Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, ended up winning the election by 5%. The Socialist Party had called for the removal of Spanish troops from Iraq during its campaigning. Zapatero promised to remove Spanish troops by 30 June 2004, and the troops were withdrawn a month earlier than expected. Twenty-eight percent of voters said that the bombings influenced their opinions and vote. An estimated 1 million voters switched their vote to the Socialist Party after the Madrid bombings. These voters who switched their votes were no longer willing to support the Popular Party's stance on war policy. The bombings also influenced 1,700,000 citizens to vote who did not plan on originally voting. On the other hand, the terrorist attacks discouraged 300,000 people from voting. Overall, there was a net 4 percent increase in voter turnout.\n\n===Trial===\nJudge Juan del Olmo found \"local cells of Islamic extremists inspired through the Internet\" guilty for the 11 March attacks, not Armed Islamic Group or Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group. These local cells consist of hashish traffickers of Moroccan origin, remotely linked to an al-Qaeda cell that had been already captured. These groups bought the explosives (dynamite Goma-2 ECO) from low-level thieves, police and Guardia Civil informers in Asturias using money from the small-scale drug trafficking.\n\nAccording to El Mundo, \"the notes found on the Moroccan informer 'Cartagena' prove that the Police had the leaders of the cell responsible for the 11 March attacks under surveillance.\" However, none of the notes refer to the preparation of any terrorist attack.\n\nThe trial of 29 defendants began on 15 February 2007. According to El Pa\u00eds, \"the Court dismantled one by one all conspiracy theories\" and demonstrated that any link with or involvement in the bombings by ETA was either misleading or groundless. During the trial the defendants retracted their previous statements and denied any involvement. According to El Mundo the questions of \"by whom, why, when and where the Madrid train attacks were planned\" are still \"unanswered\", because the alleged masterminds of the attacks were acquitted. El Mundo also claimed -among other misgivings- that the Spanish judiciary reached \"scientifically unsound\" conclusions about the kind of explosives used in the trains, and that no direct al-Qaeda link was found, thus \"debunking the key argument of the official version\". Anthropologist Scott Atran described the Madrid trial as \"a complete farce\" pointing out the fact that \"There isn't the slightest bit of evidence of any operational relationship with al-Qaida\". Instead, \"The overwhelming majority of [terrorist cells] in Europe have nothing to do with al-Qaida other than a vague relationship of ideology.\"\n\nThough the trial proceeded smoothly in its opening months, 14 of the 29 defendants began a hunger strike in May, protesting against the allegedly \"unfair\" role of political parties and media in the legal proceedings. Judge Javier G\u00f3mez Berm\u00fadez refused to suspend the trial despite the strike, and the hunger strikers ended their fast on 21 May.\n\nThe last hearing of the trial was held on 2 July 2007.\nTranscripts and videos of the hearings can be seen on datadiar.tv.\n\nOn 31 October 2007, the Audiencia Nacional of Spain handed down its judgements. Of the 28 defendants in the trial, 21 were found guilty on a range of charges from forgery to murder. Two of the defendants were sentenced each to more than 40,000 years in prison.\n\n==Police surveillance and informants==\nIn the investigations carried out to find out what went wrong in the security services, many individual negligences and miscoordinations between different branches of the police were found. The group dealing with Islamist extremists was very small and in spite of having carried out some surveillances, they were unable to stop the bombings. Also, some of the criminals involved in the \"Little Mafia\" who provided the explosives were police informants and had leaked to their case officers some tips that were not followed up on.\n\nSome of the alleged perpetrators of the bombing were reportedly under surveillance by the Spanish police since 2001.\n\nAt the time of the Madrid bombings, Spain was well equipped with internal security structures that were, for the most part, effective in the fight against terrorism. It became evident that there were coordination issues between police forces as well as within each of them. The Interior Ministry focused on correcting these weaknesses. It was Spain's goal to strengthen its police intelligence in order to deal with the risks and threats of international terrorism. This decision for the National Police and the Guardia Civil to strengthen their counter-terrorism services, led to an increase in jobs aimed at preventing and fighting global terrorism. Counter-terrorism services increased its employment by nearly 35% during the legislature. Human resources in external information services, dealing with international terrorism, grew by 72% in the National Police force and 22% in the Guardia Civil.\n\n==Controversies==\n\nThe authorship of the bombings remains a controversial issue in Spain. Sectors of the Partido Popular (PP) and some of the PP-friendly media outlets (primarily El Mundo and the Libertad Digital radio station) claim that there are inconsistencies and contradictions in the Spanish judicial investigation.\n\nAs Spanish and international investigations continue to claim the unlikeliness of ETA's active implication, these claims have shifted from direct accusations involving the Basque separatist organisation to less specific insinuations and general scepticism.\nAdditionally, there is controversy over the events that took place between the bombings and the general elections held three days later.\n\n==Reactions==\n\n\nIn the aftermath of the bombings, there were massive street demonstrations across Spain to protest against the train bombings. The international reaction was also notable, as the scale of the attack became clearer.\n\n==Memorial service for victims==\nA memorial service for the victims of this incident was held on 15 March 2004, 3 days after the incident. It was attended by King Juan Carlos I, Queen Sofia, victims' families, and about 5,000 official guests, included world leaders.\n\n==See also==\n\n\n===Specifically about the 2004 Madrid bombings===\n* Atocha station memorial\n* Brandon Mayfield, wrongfully identified via fingerprints\n* Casualties of the 2004 Madrid bombings\n* Controversies about the 2004 Madrid train bombings\n* Forest of Remembrance\n* Reactions to the 2004 Madrid train bombings\n* Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero\n* 2004 Madrid train bombings suspects\n* Rabei Osman\n\n===Other===\n* List of terrorist incidents involving railway systems\n* 2000 Madrid bombing\n* 2006 Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport bombing\n* 11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings\n* 7 July 2005 London bombings\n* 2006 German train bombing attempts\n* 2006 Ontario terrorism plot\n* November 2015 Paris attacks\n\n==References==\n\n\n\n==External links==\n\n*  BBC News In Depth\n* U.N.

{"title":"Rangoon bombing","article":"The Rangoon bombing of 9 October 1983, was an assassination attempt against Chun Doo-hwan, the fifth president of South Korea, in Rangoon, Burma (present-day Yangon, Myanmar). The attempt was orchestrated by North Korea. Although Chun survived, 21 people died in the attack and 46 were injured. Two of the three suspected bombers were captured, one of whom confessed to being a North Korean military officer.\n\n==Bombing==\nOn 9 October 1983, President Chun Doo-hwan flew to Rangoon on an official visit to capital of Burma. During the visit he planned to lay a wreath at the Martyrs' Mausoleum to commemorate Aung San, one of the founders of independent Burma who was assassinated in 1947.  As some of the president's staff began assembling at the mausoleum, one of three bombs concealed in the roof exploded.  The huge blast ripped through the crowd below, killing 21 people and wounding 46 others. Four senior South Korean politicians were killed: foreign minister Lee Beom-seok; minister of power resource, Suh Sang-chul; economic planning minister and deputy prime minister, Suh Suk Joon; and minister for commerce and industry, Kim Dong Whie. Fourteen South Korean presidential advisers, journalists, and security officials were killed; four Burmese nationals, including three journalists, were also among the dead. President Chun was saved because his car had been delayed in traffic and was only minutes from arriving at the memorial. The bomb was reportedly detonated early because the presidential bugle which signalled Chun's arrival mistakenly rang out a few minutes ahead of schedule.\n\n==Perpetrators==\nBurmese police identified three suspects, a Korean People's Army major and two captains. A police investigation revealed that they had slipped off a ship docked in Rangoon port, and had received explosives in a North Korean diplomatic mission. Suspect Kang Min-chul and another attacker attempted to commit suicide by blowing themselves up with a hand grenade that same day, but survived and were arrested, although Kang lost an arm. A third suspect, Zin Bo, went missing, but was hunted down by the Burmese Army. Zin managed to kill three soldiers before being shot dead. Kang Min-chul confessed his mission and links to North Korea, an action by which he was able to avoid a death sentence and instead received life imprisonment.  His colleague was executed by hanging. North Korea denied any links to Kang, who was sent to Insein Prison, north of Rangoon.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe United States quietly provided military and logistics support to ensure that the surviving delegates and bodies of the deceased were safely returned to Korea. According to Victor Cha, an academic and former Director for Asian Affairs in the White House's National Security Council, a South Korean official recounted to him the sentiment that \"this is what only a true ally like the United States was capable of doing, in ways that would never become public but would be remembered.\"\n\nAs a result of the bombing, Burma suspended diplomatic relations with North Korea. China, which had passed on a diplomatic note requesting trilateral talks between North and South Korea and the US on North Korea's behalf just prior to the bombing, reprimanded North Korea in the state media. Chinese officials refused to meet or talk with North Korean officials for months afterward. \n\nIn 1994, the representative of South Korea to the United Nations General Assembly linked this incident with the downing of Korean Air Flight 858, which he alleged was sponsored by the same government acting with impunity. As a result, North Korea was listed as a state sponsor of terrorism except between 2008 and November 2017.\n\n==Kang's fate==\nKang was Myanmar's longest-serving prisoner. He learned to speak the Burmese language fluently according to one of his fellow prisoners. Yangon's moves towards resuming relations with North Korea led to speculation about what would happen to Kang.  Because North Korea denied that he was a North Korean citizen, he may have been considered a stateless person. Kang reportedly did not want to go to North Korea, which he believed considered him a traitor (because of his having revealed its criminal operations); or to South Korea, which might have tried him for his role in the assassination attempt.\n\nIn 2006, Chung Hyung-Keun, a member of South Korea's Grand National Party and a former employee of South Korean intelligence, sponsored a bill to bring Kang to South Korea. Kang died of liver cancer on 18 May 2008 while being transferred to the hospital from Insein Prison of Yangon.\n\n==List of victims==\n\n* Suh Seok-jun (\uc11c\uc11d\uc900, 1938 ~ 1983), Deputy Prime Minister\n* Lee Beom-seok (\uc774\ubc94\uc11d, 1925 ~ 1983), Minister of Foreign Affairs\n* Kim Dong-hwi (\uae40\ub3d9\ud718), Minister of Commerce\n* Suh Sang-Chul (\uc11c\uc0c1\ucca0), Minister of Power Resources\n* Ham Byeong-chun (\ud568\ubcd1\ucd98), Chief Presidential Secretary\n* Lee Gye-cheol (\uc774\uacc4\ucca0), Ambassador to Burma\n* Kim Jae-ik (\uae40\uc7ac\uc775, 1938 ~ 1983), Senior Presidential Secretary for Economic Affairs\n* Ha Dong-seon (\ud558\ub3d9\uc120), Planning Director of International Cooperation Committee\n* Lee Gi-uk (\uc774\uae30\uc6b1), Vice Minister of Finance\n* Gang In-hui (\uac15\uc778\ud76c), Vice Minister of Agriculture, Forest, Fishery\n* Kim Yong-hwan (\uae40\uc6a9\ud658), Vice Minister of Science and Technology\n* Sim Sang-u (\uc2ec\uc0c1\uc6b0, 1938 ~ 1983), a member of the National Assembly\n* Min Byeong-seok (\ubbfc\ubcd1\uc11d), physician in attendance on the President\n* Lee Jae-gwan (\uc774\uc7ac\uad00), presidential press secretary\n* Han Gyeong-hui (\ud55c\uacbd\ud76c), a presidential guard\n* Jeong Tae-jin (\uc815\ud0dc\uc9c4), a presidential guard\n* Lee Jung-hyeon (\uc774\uc911\ud604), reporter of The Dong-a Ilbo\n\n==See also==\n\n* North Korea's illicit activities\n* Blue House Raid\n* Sejong Institute\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n*  Video footage of bombing on YouTube\n*  Brief summary from Onwar.com","urls":["http:\/\/www.irrawaddy.org\/aviewer.asp?a=6977&z=163","http:\/\/english.yna.co.kr\/Engnews\/20060223\/480100000020060223092719E9.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20071018052258\/http:\/\/english.yna.co.kr\/Engnews\/20060223\/480100000020060223092719E9.html","http:\/\/www.multinationalmonitor.org\/hyper\/issues\/1983\/11\/shorrock.html","http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/magazine\/article\/0,9171,952196,00.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20081222000819\/http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/magazine\/article\/0,9171,952196,00.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/11\/20\/us\/politics\/north-korea-trump-terror.html","http:\/\/www.hani.co.kr\/arti\/society\/society_general\/288703.html","http:\/\/100.nate.com\/dicsearch\/pentry.html?i=240562"]}
{"title":"1996 Manchester bombing","article":"The 1996 Manchester bombing was an attack carried out by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) on Saturday 15 June 1996. The IRA detonated a  lorry bomb on Corporation Street in the centre of Manchester, England. It was the biggest bomb detonated in Great Britain since the Second World War, it targeted the city's infrastructure and economy and caused significant damage, estimated by insurers at \u00a3700\u00a0million (equivalent to \u00a3 in ) \u2013 only surpassed by the 2001 September 11 attacks and the 1993 Bishopsgate bombing in terms of financial cost.\n\nThe IRA had sent telephoned warnings about 90 minutes before the bomb detonated. At least 75,000 people were evacuated from the area, but the bomb squad were unable to defuse the bomb in time. More than 200 people were injured but there were no fatalities despite the strength of the bomb, which has been largely credited to the fast response of emergency services in evacuating the city centre before the bomb could explode. At the time, England was hosting the Euro '96 football championships and a Russia vs. Germany match was scheduled to take place in Manchester the following day.\n\nAlthough Manchester had been targeted by the IRA before, it had not been subjected to an attack on this scale. In February 1996, the IRA had ended its seventeen-month ceasefire with a large truck bomb attack on London's Canary Wharf financial district, though the 3,300-pound bomb of Manchester was three times the size of the Canary Wharf bomb. The Manchester bombing was condemned by the British and Irish governments and U.S. President Bill Clinton. Five days after the blast, the IRA issued a statement from Dublin in which it claimed responsibility, but regretted causing injury to civilians.\n\nSeveral buildings near the explosion were damaged beyond repair and had to be demolished, while many more were closed for months for structural repairs. Most of the rebuilding work was completed by the end of 1999, at a cost of \u00a31.2\u00a0billion, although redevelopment continued until 2005. The perpetrators of the attack have not been caught, and Greater Manchester Police have conceded it is unlikely that anyone will be charged in connection with the bombing. The bombing has however been viewed by some as a 'catalyst' for starting the city's mass regeneration and turning Manchester into a modern British \"powerhouse\" city with above national average economic growth in the 20 years following the bombing.\n\n==Background==\nFrom 1970, the Provisional Irish Republican Army was carrying out an armed campaign with the ultimate objective of bringing about a united Ireland. As well as attacking military and political targets, it also bombed infrastructure and commercial targets in Northern Ireland and England. It believed that by damaging the economy and causing severe disruption, it could pressurise the British government to negotiate a withdrawal from Northern Ireland. Manchester had been the target of earlier IRA bombs. Firebombs damaged city centre businesses in 1973 and 1974, for which a man was later imprisoned. In April 1974, a bomb exploded at Manchester Magistrates' Court, injuring twelve. In 1975, IRA bomb factories were found in Greater Manchester and five men were imprisoned for planning attacks in North West England. On 4 December 1992, the IRA detonated two small bombs in Manchester city centre, forcing police to evacuate thousands of shoppers. More than 60 were hurt by shattered glass and the blasts cost an estimated \u00a310\u00a0million in damage and business losses.\n\nThe Downing Street Declaration of 1993 allowed Sinn F\u00e9in, a political party associated with the IRA, to participate in all-party peace negotiations on condition that the IRA called a ceasefire. The IRA called a ceasefire on 31 August 1994. John Major's government, dependent on Ulster Unionist Party votes, then began insisting that the IRA must fully disarm before there could be any all-party negotiations. The IRA saw this as a demand for total surrender and believed the British were unwilling to hold negotiations. It ended its ceasefire on 9 February 1996 when it detonated a powerful truck bomb in Canary Wharf, one of the two financial districts of London. The blast killed two people and caused an estimated \u00a3150\u00a0million worth of damage. The IRA then planted five other devices in London within the space of 10\u00a0weeks.\n\nThe IRA planned to carry out a similar bombing in Manchester. The city may have been chosen because it was one of the host cities of the Euro '96 football tournament, attended by visitors and media organisations from all over Europe, guaranteeing the IRA what Margaret Thatcher called the \"oxygen of publicity\". A Russia vs Germany match was to take place at Old Trafford in Manchester a day after the bombing. The year before, Manchester had also won its bid to host the 2002 Commonwealth Games, at the time the biggest multi-sport event ever to be staged in Britain.\n\nOn 10 June 1996, multi-party negotiations began in Belfast. Sinn F\u00e9in had been elected to take part but were barred because the IRA had not resumed its ceasefire or agreed to disarm.\n\n==Details of the bombing==\nThe IRA's South Armagh Brigade was tasked with planning and carrying out the attack. It had also been responsible for the Canary Wharf bombing in February, and the Bishopsgate bombing in 1993. Its members mixed the explosives in Ireland and shipped them by freight from Dublin to England. In London, the bomb was assembled and loaded into the back of a red and white Ford Cargo van. On 14 June it was driven north towards Manchester, accompanied by a Ford Granada which served as a \"scout car\".\n\n===Discovery===\n\n\nAt about 9:20\u00a0am on Saturday 15 June 1996, the Ford van was parked on Corporation Street, outside the Marks & Spencer store, near the Arndale Centre. After setting the bomb's timer, two men \u2013 wearing hooded jackets, baseball caps and sunglasses \u2013 left the vehicle and walked to Cathedral Street, where a third man picked them up in the Ford Granada. The truck had been parked on double yellow lines with its hazard lights flashing. Within three minutes a traffic warden had issued the vehicle with a parking ticket and called for its removal. At about 9:40\u00a0am, Granada Studios on Quay Street received a telephone call claiming that there was a bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode in one hour. The caller had an Irish accent and gave an IRA codeword so that police would know the threat was genuine. Four other telephoned warnings were sent to television\/radio stations, newspapers and a hospital.\n\nThe first policeman to arrive on the scene noticed wires running from the van's dashboard through a hole into the back and reported that he had found the bomb. Forensic experts later estimated that the bomb weighed 1,500\u20131,600\u00a0kg (3,300\u20133,500\u00a0lb) and was a mixture of semtex, a military-grade plastic explosive, and ammonium nitrate fertiliser, a cheap and easily obtainable explosive used extensively by the IRA. Components of what may have been a tremble trigger were also found later, designed to detonate the bomb if it was tampered with.\n\n===Evacuation===\nAt 10:00\u00a0am, there were an estimated 75,000\u201380,000 people shopping and working in the vicinity. An evacuation of the area was undertaken by police officers from Bootle Street police station, supplemented by officers drafted into Manchester to control the football crowds. The police were helped by security guards from local shops.\n\nOne group worked to move people away from the bomb while another, assisted by firefighters and security guards, established a continuously expanding cordon around the area to prevent entry. By 11:10\u00a0am the cordon was at the greatest extent that available manpower would permit, about a quarter of a mile (400\u00a0m) from the truck and  in circumference.\n\n===Explosion===\nThe bomb squad arrived from their Liverpool base at 10:46\u00a0am and attempted to defuse the bomb using a remote-controlled device, but they were unable to conduct positive EOD action, resulting in the timer expiring and functioning the device. The bomb exploded at 11:17\u00a0am, causing an estimated \u00a3700\u00a0million (\u00a3 as of 2018) of damage and affecting a third of the city centre's retail space. Marks & Spencer, the sky bridge connecting it with the Arndale Centre, and neighbouring buildings were destroyed. It was the largest peacetime bomb ever detonated in Great Britain, and the blast created a mushroom cloud which rose 300 metres (1,000 feet) from the ground. The explosion could be heard up to 15 miles away and left a crater 15 metres wide. Glass and masonry were thrown into the air, and behind the police cordon\u00a0\u2013 up to  away, people were showered by falling debris. There were no fatalities, but 212\u00a0people were injured. A search of the area for casualties was confused by mannequins blasted from shop windows, which were sometimes mistaken for bodies. Hospitals across Greater Manchester were made ready to receive those injured in the blast. The police commandeered a Metrolink tram to take 50 of the casualties to North Manchester General Hospital, which treated 79 in total; a further 80 were cared for at the Manchester Royal Infirmary, and many others were treated in the streets by ambulance crews assisted by doctors and nurses who happened to be in the city centre that morning.\n\n\n==Reaction==\nThe bombing was condemned by British Prime Minister John Major and his government, by the opposition, and by individual members of parliament (MPs) as a \"sickening\", \"callous\" and \"barbaric\" terrorist attack. Early on, Major stated that, \"This explosion looks like the work of the IRA. It is the work of a few fanatics and\u00a0... causes absolute revulsion in Ireland as it does here\". Sinn F\u00e9in was criticised by Taoiseach John Bruton for being \"struck mute\" on the attack in the immediate aftermath. Bruton described the bombing as \"a slap in the face to people who've been trying, against perhaps their better instincts, to give Sinn F\u00e9in a chance to show that they could persuade the IRA to reinstate the ceasefire\". The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, stated he was \"deeply outraged by the bomb explosion\" and joined Bruton and Major in \"utterly condemning this brutal and cowardly act of terrorism\". Sinn F\u00e9in President, Gerry Adams, stated that he was \"shocked and saddened\" by the bombing. He insisted that his party was committed to achieving a peace settlement and argued \"it is sheer folly to return to the old agenda of excluding Sinn F\u00e9in and seeking to isolate republicans\". On 20 June 1996, the IRA claimed responsibility for the bombing, and stated that it \"sincerely regretted\" causing injury to civilians. The IRA statement continued:\n\n\nThe bombing came five days after the beginning of the peace talks in Belfast, and represented the IRA's opposition to talks which excluded republicans. The attack was part of a political strategy by the IRA to be included in negotiations on the IRA's own terms. According to historian Richard English: \"What they were doing with their return to bombings like the Manchester bomb was saying, 'We can still return to war if we want to. We can still put off a huge bomb in your cities and devastate them and therefore you have to deal with us'\".\n\nIn an effort to allay fears that Manchester's considerable Irish community might be subjected to reprisal attacks, Councillors Richard Leese and Martin Pagel\u00a0\u2013 leader and deputy leader of Manchester City Council respectively\u00a0\u2013 made a public visit to the Irish World Heritage Centre in Cheetham Hill. In the event there were only a few incidents, the most serious of which occurred on the evening of the bombing, when a gang of ten men rampaged through an Irish-themed bar in the centre of Middleton, shouting the Ulster loyalist slogan \"No surrender\" and smashing furniture and windows. Seven days after the bombing, Manchester Council held a 'family fun day' in front of the Town Hall in Albert Square to encourage shoppers and visitors back into the city centre, the first of a \"series of events and entertainments\". The Euro '96 football match between Russia and Germany at Old Trafford went ahead as planned the day following the bombing, after the stadium had been heavily guarded overnight and carefully searched; the game, which Germany won 3\u20130, was watched by a capacity crowd of 50,700.\n\n==Investigation==\n\n\nIn an effort to trace the route of the Ford van, police examined CCTV footage from every major road and motorway taken in England within two days of the bombing. Footage revealed that the van was driven south along the M1 motorway into London on the Friday afternoon before the attack. It was seen again heading north along the motorway at 7:40\u00a0pm, accompanied by the Ford Granada. Detectives surmised that the van had been loaded with explosives in London and that the Granada was intended to be the getaway vehicle. The truck was last recorded travelling east along the M62 motorway towards Manchester at 8:31\u00a0am on the morning of the explosion.\n\nPolice in Manchester were aware that their Metropolitan Police colleagues in London were investigating a suspected IRA unit based in the capital, and wondered whether the London unit was responsible for the Manchester bombing. On 15 July, Metropolitan police arrested six men suspected of IRA membership: Donal Gannon, John Crawley, Gerard Hanratty, Robert Morrow, Patrick Martin, and Francis Rafferty. Each was tried and convicted of \"conspiracy to cause explosions at National Grid electricity stations\", and sentenced to 35\u00a0years in jail. Police in Manchester meanwhile worked to establish if the men were also responsible for the Manchester bomb.\n\nTheir investigation was led by Detective Chief Inspector Gordon Mutch of the Greater Manchester Police (GMP), \"astonishingly\u00a0... the only person ever charged with a criminal offence in connection with the Manchester bomb\". The van's last registered owner told police that he had sold it to a dealer in Peterborough, who had in turn sold the van on to a man calling himself Tom Fox, two weeks before the bombing. After the purchase price was delivered in cash by a taxi driver, the dealer was instructed to take the van to a nearby lorry park, and leave it there with the keys and documents hidden inside.\n\nOn checking records of telephone calls made to the dealer, the police found that some had been made from a mobile phone registered in Ireland, and on further checking the records of that phone it appeared that the calls were made from locations consistent with the known whereabouts of the Ford truck. One call was to a known IRA member. The phone was last used at 9:23\u00a0am on the morning of the bombing, just three minutes after the bombers had parked their truck in Corporation Street. On 27 June, the phone's registered owner reported that it had been stolen 17\u00a0days earlier, but the police felt they had gathered enough evidence to bring a prosecution against the six IRA men held in London.\n\nAt a meeting attended by the commander of Special Branch in Manchester, a GMP assistant chief constable and a \"senior officer\" from the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), it was decided, for reasons never made public, not to present the findings of the investigation to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the body responsible for undertaking criminal prosecutions in England. The three may have felt that as the IRA suspects were already in police custody they were no longer a threat, or that to pursue the case against them may have jeopardised ongoing undercover operations. It was not until 1998 that the police finally sent their file to the CPS, who decided not to prosecute.\n\n==Leak==\nEarly in 1999, Steve Panter, chief crime reporter for the Manchester Evening News, leaked classified Special Branch documents naming those suspected of the bombing. The documents also revealed that the man suspected of organising the attack had visited Manchester shortly after the bombing and been under covert police surveillance as he toured the devastated city centre before returning to his home in South Armagh. Suspicion fell on Mutch as the source of the leaked documents after an analysis of mobile phone records placed both him and Panter at the same hotel in Skipton, North Yorkshire, about  from Manchester on the same evening.\n\nOn 21 April 1999, the Manchester Evening News named a man it described as \"a prime suspect in the 1996 Manchester bomb plot\". The newspaper reported that the file sent by Greater Manchester Police to the Crown Prosecution Service contained the sentence: \"It is the opinion of the investigating officers of GMP that there is sufficient evidence to charge [him] with being a party in a conspiracy to cause explosions in the United Kingdom.\" The man denied any involvement. The Attorney General wrote in a letter to a local MP that the advice given to the CPS by an independent lawyer was that \"there was not a case to answer on the evidence available\u00a0... a judge would stop the case\": the Attorney General further wrote that the decision not to prosecute was not influenced by the government. The newspaper also identified the six men arrested in London on 15 July as having planned the attack. By July 2000, all six had been released under the terms of the 1998 Belfast Agreement.\n\nAs of 2019, Panter and Mutch are the only people to have been arrested in connection with the bombing. Mutch was tried for \"misconduct in a public office\" during an 11-day trial held in January 2002 but was acquitted. During the trial, Panter was found in contempt of court for refusing to reveal his source, an offence punishable by a term of imprisonment without the right of appeal. Greater Manchester Police announced in 2006 that there was no realistic chance of convicting those responsible for the bombing.\n\n==Reconstruction==\nAbout twelve buildings in the immediate vicinity of the explosion were severely damaged. Overall,  of retail space and  of office space were put out of use. Insurers paid out \u00a3411\u00a0million (\u00a3 as of 2018) in damages for what was at the time one of the most expensive man-made disasters ever, and there was considerable under-insurance.\nVictims of the bombing received a total of \u00a31,145,971 in compensation from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority; one individual received \u00a3146,524, the largest amount awarded as a result of this incident.\n\n\n\nAccording to Home Office statistics, an estimated 400\u00a0businesses within half a mile (0.8\u00a0km) of the blast were affected, 40% of which did not recover. The heaviest damage was sustained by the three buildings nearest the bomb: Michael House, comprising a Marks & Spencer store and a six-storey office block; Longridge House, offices for Royal and Sun Alliance, an insurance company; and the Arndale Centre, a shopping mall. Michael House was deemed beyond economic repair and demolished. Marks & Spencer took the opportunity to acquire and demolish the adjacent Longridge House, using the enlarged site for the world's biggest branch of the store. The company's fortunes changed during construction, and Selfridges subsequently co-occupied the building; Marks & Spencer leased part of the Lewis's store in the interim. The frontage of the Arndale was badly damaged and was remodelled when this area of the city centre was redeveloped.\n\n\nThe glass domes of the Corn Exchange and the Royal Exchange were blown in. The landlord of the Corn Exchange invoked a force majeure condition in the lease to evict all tenants, and the building was converted into a shopping centre.  The dome of the Royal Exchange shifted in the blast; its reconstruction took two and a half years and cost \u00a332\u00a0million, paid for by the National Lottery.\n\nThe possibility of rebuilding parts of the city centre was raised within days of the bomb. On 26 June 1996, Michael Heseltine, the Deputy Prime Minister, announced an international competition for designs of the redevelopment of the bomb-affected area. Bids were received from 27\u00a0entrants, five of whom were invited to submit designs in a second round.  It was announced on 5 November 1996 that the winning design was by a consortium headed by EDAW.\n\n\n==Redevelopment==\n\nMuch of the 1960s redevelopment of Manchester's city centre was unpopular with residents. Market Street, near the explosion and at that time the second-busiest shopping street in the UK, was considered by some commentators a \"fearful\" place, to be \"avoided like the plague\". Until Margaret Thatcher's third consecutive election victory in 1987, the staunchly Labour-controlled Manchester Council believed that Manchester's regeneration should be funded solely by public money, despite the government's insistence on only funding schemes with a significant element of private investment. Graham Stringer, leader of Manchester City Council, later admitted that after the 1987 General Election result \"there was no get out of jail card. We had gambled on Labour winning the General Election and we lost.\" Thatcher's victory effectively put paid to Manchester's \"socialist experiment\", and Stringer shortly afterwards wrote a letter of capitulation to Nicholas Ridley, then Secretary of State for the Environment, saying, \"in a nutshell; OK, you win, we'd like to work together with you\".\n\nEfforts at improvement before the bombing had in some respects made matters worse, cutting off the area north of the Arndale Centre\u00a0\u2013 the exterior of which was widely unloved\u00a0\u2013 from the rest of the city centre. A large building nearby, now redeveloped as The Printworks and formerly occupied by the Daily Mirror newspaper, had been unoccupied since 1987. Many locals therefore considered that \"the bomb was the best thing that ever happened to Manchester\", as it cleared the way for redevelopment of the dysfunctional city centre, a view also expressed in 2007 by Terry Rooney, MP for Bradford North. The leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition on Manchester City Council, Simon Ashley, responded that \"I take exception to his [Rooney's] comments about the IRA bomb. No one who was in the city on that day, who lost their jobs or was scared witless or injured by the blast, would say the bomb was the best thing to happen to Manchester\". Sir Gerald Kaufman, MP for Manchester Gorton, stated that the bomb provided the opportunity for redeveloping Manchester city centre, although it was not fully exploited. \"The bomb was obviously bad but from a redevelopment point of view, it was a lost opportunity. While the area around St Ann's Square and Deansgate is not disagreeable, if you compare it with Birmingham and its exciting development, we've got nothing to touch that in Manchester\". Howard Bernstein, chief executive of Manchester City Council, has been quoted as saying \"people say the bomb turned out to be a great thing for Manchester. That's rubbish.\" There was already substantial regeneration and redevelopment taking place in the city centre before the bombing, in support of the Manchester bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics, its second Olympic bid. Tom Bloxham, chairman of property development group Urban Splash and of the Arts Council England (North West), agreed with Bernstein that the bomb attack was not the trigger for the large-scale redevelopment that has taken place in Manchester since the early 1990s:\n\n\n\n==Memorials==\nA pillar box that survived the blast, despite being yards from the explosion, now carries a small brass plaque recording the bombing. It was removed during construction and redevelopment work, and returned to its original spot when Corporation Street reopened. The plaque reads:\n\n\n\nA Thanksgiving service for the \"Miracle of Manchester\" was held at Manchester Cathedral on 24 July 2002, to coincide with the arrival of the Commonwealth Games baton, attended by Queen Elizabeth II and The Duke of Edinburgh. At 11:17\u00a0am on 15 June 2006, a candle was lit at a memorial held at Manchester Cathedral to mark the tenth anniversary of the bombing.\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\"One Man's Fool\", the closing track on Genesis' 1997 album Calling All Stations, was inspired by the bombing. Tony Banks stated in a SongFacts interview: \"I remember I wrote the song \"One Man's Fool,\" which was on the Calling All Stations album [1997]. If anybody hears it now, they would assume that that lyric was referring to the bombing of the Twin Towers, but it wasn't. It was written four years before, and yet it sounds like we were recalling that. I was actually writing about a bomb attack in Manchester, in England, which was done by the IRA at the time, and the idea that people carry out these attacks and did they really believe that, all the destruction, that it really is worth it? But, it still works, unfortunately, because we have this kind of terrorism still out there.\"\n\n==See also==\n*Baltic Exchange bombing\n*Manchester Arena bombing\n*Oklahoma City bombing\n*Timeline of Provisional IRA actions (1990s)\n*Timeline of the Northern Ireland Troubles\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n\n==Further reading==\n* \n\n==External links==\n\n*  BBC report of the bombing\n*  BBC image gallery related to the bombing\n*  Flickr image gallery related to the bombing\n*  Manchester Evening News image gallery related to the bombing\n*  The Manchester Bombing A further report of the bombing.\n*  Rebuilding Manchester \u2013 Comprehensive online resource with over 1,000 photographs illustrating the rebuilding of Manchester City Centre Prepared by Planning Consultant Euan Kellie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStills taken from India 99, a Greater Manchester Police helicopter, showing the Ford van moments before the blast, the explosion taking place, and the resulting mushroom cloud over the city, dwarfing the adjacent 23-storey high-rise, Arndale House.\nA damaged traffic light that stood on the corner of the junction between Cross Street and Market Street at the time of the explosion, now in the Museum of Science and Industry.\nClose to the location of the blast, 2009.\nNew security safeguards were included in the redevelopment of the city centre including retractable bollards and pedestrianised streets.\nA pillar box that withstood the bomb blast.

{"title":"Death of Brian Wells","article":"Brian Douglas Wells (November 15, 1956\u00a0\u2013 August 28, 2003) was an American pizza delivery man who was murdered during a complex plot involving a bank robbery, scavenger hunt, and homemade explosive device near his hometown of Erie, Pennsylvania. Wells, who was surrounded by police, was murdered when an explosive collar locked to his neck detonated. It is known as the \"collar bomb\" or \"pizza bomber\" case. The incident was shown live on television.\n\nWells' involvement in the plot is a matter of controversy. Investigators concluded and a federal prosecutor's indictment alleged Wells was a knowing participant in the bank robbery but was told the bomb was fake and did not know his co-conspirators intended for him to die. Wells' family said he was not a willing participant in the incident.\n\nThe multiple aspects of the crime meant the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) led an investigative task force in conjunction with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) and the Pennsylvania State Police (PSP).  It is the only crime of its kind; CNN described it as \"one of the most complicated and bizarre crimes in the annals of the FBI\". The incident has gained extensive coverage in mass media, including the Netflix series Evil Genius.\n\nA federal grand jury indicted Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong and Kenneth Barnes on charges of bank robbery, conspiracy, and weapons charges. Fellow co-conspirator William \"Bill\" Rothstein had died and his roommate Floyd Stockton was given immunity from prosecution so he could testify against Diehl-Armstrong. In 2008, U.S. District Judge Sean J. McLaughlin sentenced Barnes to 45 years in federal prison. Two years later, Diehl-Armstrong was sentenced to life in prison.\n\n== Biography ==\nBrian Wells was born in Warren, Pennsylvania to Rose and Korean war veteran Harold Wells. In 1973, when Wells was a 16-year-old sophomore, he dropped out of Erie's East High School and went to work as a mechanic.\n\n== Conspirators ==\nAt Kenneth Barnes' home, he, Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong, and William Rothstein discussed ways they could make money. Diehl-Armstrong suggested Barnes kill her father, Harold Diehl, so she would receive an inheritance. Barnes told her he was willing to do this for $200,000.  The collar bomb-bank robbery plot was hatched to obtain enough money to pay Barnes to kill Diehl-Armstrong's father. In return for a reduced sentence, Barnes later told investigators Diehl-Armstrong was the mastermind of the crime and that she wanted the money to pay Barnes to kill her father, whom she believed was wasting her inheritance.\n\nDiehl-Armstrong, Barnes, and Rothstein seem to have had issues with compulsive hoarding.\n\nMarjorie Diehl-Armstrong (February 26, 1949 \u2013 April 4, 2017) had a history of suffering from multiple mental illnesses including bipolar disorder, since her early teens,  and seems to have been a serial killer. Before her mental health deteriorated in her twenties, Diehl-Armstrong was an \"exemplary student\" in high school and earned a master's degree from Gannon College. In 1984, she shot her boyfriend Robert Thomas six times as he lay on the couch but was acquitted on claims of self-defense.  Her husband and several other partners also died under suspicious circumstances. Diehl-Armstrong died from breast cancer in prison on April 4, 2017, at the age of 68. \n\nKenneth Barnes (1954 \u2013 June 20, 2019) was a retired television repairman, crack dealer, and Diehl-Armstrong's \"fishing buddy\". He suffered from diabetes and died in prison on June 20, 2019, at the age of 64-65. \n\nWilliam Ansel \"Bill\" Rothstein (January 17, 1944  \u2013 July 30, 2004) was born to Matthias Rothstein and B. Virginia Bryner. His father ran the Rola Bottling Company from 1945 to 1978. Rothstein dated Diehl-Armstrong in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He was implicated in a 1977 murder after he gave a handgun to a friend who used it to murder a romantic rival; he later attempted to destroy the weapon but was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony. Rothstein was  tall and regularly wore overalls. He was a handyman and part-time shop teacher, and also was part of a group called the \"fractured intellectuals\"; intelligent people who were not well-adjusted. He spoke French and Hebrew fluently. Rothstein was admitted to the Millcreek Community Hospital on July 23, 2004, having previously been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma showing diffuse, large-cell type myeloproliferative lymphoma, and died on July 30 that year at the age of 60.\n\nFloyd Arthur \"Jay\" Stockton Jr. (born 1947), who lived as a fugitive at Rothstein's house, is a convicted rapist of a disabled teenager. He was granted immunity for his testimony against Diehl-Armstrong, but was never called to testify in court due to illness.\n\n=== Conspirators' connection to Wells ===\nImmediately after his death, investigators searched Wells' house and found a list of people he knew including two prostitutes unknown to other members of his family. One of the prostitutes he frequented, Jessica Hoopsick, knew Kenneth Barnes, who dealt crack and whose house was used by prostitutes.\n\n=== Wells as conspirator ===\nAccording to law enforcement reports, Wells participated in the planning of the bank robbery the day before and was aware of the complex plot although he believed the bomb would be fake and would serve as an alibi if he was caught. According to an FBI affidavit, two witnesses confirmed that Wells talked about the robbery about a month before it occurred. Wells was seen leaving Rothstein's house the day before the incident, and investigators believe he participated in a rehearsal. It was believed Wells was killed to reduce the number of witnesses. \n\nFamily and friends of Wells dispute his involvement in the bank robbery and his own death; according to them, Wells was accosted at gunpoint and forced to wear the bomb.\n\n==The crime==\n=== Collar bomb ===\n\nThe bomb used in the killing consisted of a hinged collar that worked like a large handcuff to go around the neck, four keyholes that went under the chin, and a rectangular section that contained two pipe bombs and two kitchen timers. One electronic timer hung down over the chest. The device had several decoys, such as unconnected wires, a toy cell phone, and stickers bearing deceptive warnings.\n\n===Pizza delivery===\nWells worked as a pizza delivery driver at the Mama Mia's Pizzeria in Erie for ten years before his death. Just after 1:30 p.m. on August 28, 2003, the pizzeria received a call from a payphone at a nearby gas station. The owner could not understand the customer and passed the phone to Wells, who received a call to deliver two pizzas to 8631 Peach Street, an address a few miles from the pizzeria. The address was the location of the transmitting tower of  WSEE-TV at the end of a dirt road. \n\nAccording to law enforcement, upon arriving at the television tower, Wells found the plot had changed and learned the bomb was real. Wells' family disputes this account of the events at the television tower; according to them, Wells was accosted at gunpoint by strangers and forced to participate. The details of events at the tower that led to the bomb being attached to Wells' neck have never been firmly established but evidence suggests there was a struggle and that Barnes, Diehl-Armstrong, Rothstein, and Stockton were all present at that time.\n\n\nIn interviews by law enforcement, Stockton claimed to be the one to put the bomb around Wells' neck. When Wells discovered that the bomb was real, Barnes said a pistol was fired in order to force Wells' compliance, and witnesses confirmed hearing a gunshot. After the bomb was applied, Wells was given a sophisticated home-made shotgun, which had the appearance of an unusually shaped cane. \n\nWells was instructed to claim that three black men had forced the bomb on him and were holding him as a hostage.\n\n=== Treasure hunt ===\nWells' corpse was found with nine pages of lengthy, hand-written instructions addressed to \"Bomb Hostage\" telling him to rob the bank. The instructions also included a Treasure hunt, listing a series of strictly timed tasks of collecting keys that would delay detonation and eventually defuse the bomb. It also warned that Wells would be under constant surveillance and any attempts to contact authorities would result in the bomb's detonation. \"ACT NOW, THINK LATER OR YOU WILL DIE!\" was scrawled at the bottom of the instructions.\n\n===Robbery===\nWells was instructed to \"quietly\" enter the PNC Bank at Summit Towne Center on Peach Street and give the teller an affixed note demanding $250,000, and to use his shotgun to threaten anyone who did not cooperate or attempted to flee. Upon entering the bank around 2:30 p.m., Wells slid the note to a teller. The note stated the bomb would explode in fifteen minutes and that the full amount must be handed over within that time. The teller was unable to access the vault that quickly and gave Wells a bag containing $8,702, with which he exited the bank. \n\nAt 2:38, a witness called 9-1-1 from the bank and reported a male leaving the bank with \"a bomb or something wrapped around his neck\". This is the first-known emergency call for the incident. According to witnesses at the bank and surveillance footage, after entering the bank, Wells waited in line. When he reached the counter, he began sucking a lollipop. He appeared confident as he left the bank, swinging his cane gun and the bag of money \"like Charlie Chaplin\" according to one witness.\n\n===Arrest and death===\n\nAround fifteen minutes after Wells left the bank, he had completed the first task of the scavenger hunt. He was proceeding with the second task when police saw him standing outside his automobile and promptly arrested him, handcuffed him and left him sitting on the ground in the parking lot. Wells said three unnamed black people had placed a bomb around his neck, provided him with the shotgun, and told him they would kill him unless he committed the robbery and complete several other tasks.\n\nThe responding police officers did not attempt to disarm the device, instead focusing on clearing the immediate area of pedestrians and ensuring Wells could not detonate the device. The bomb squad was first called at 3:04 p.m., at least thirty minutes after the first 9-1-1 call from the bank and about ten minutes after Wells was arrested. At 3:18, three minutes before the bomb squad arrived, the bomb detonated and blasted a fist-sized hole in Wells's chest, killing him in minutes. Traffic congestion in the area delayed the bomb squad's arrival but personnel from the ATF still considered their response appropriately quick.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nWJET-TV, an Erie ABC affiliate, broadcast the event live on the air but did not show the moment of the detonation live due to a technical problem. The station provided the footage to FBI investigators, ABC's head office, and sister station in Buffalo, New York. The footage was subsequently leaked to a shock jock on DC101, a radio station in Washington, D.C. who posted it on his website in September 2003. Although he subsequently removed the video at WJET-TV's request, by then it had been posted to numerous video-sharing websites.\n\nThough the note claimed Wells would gain extra time by each key found, police later traveled the note's route and could not complete it in the allotted time, implying Wells would not have had enough time to get the bomb defused. The collar of the bomb was still intact and Wells's body was decapitated so it could be retained. \n\n=== Death of Robert Pinetti ===\nThe case also involved two further deaths linked to the conspirators. On August 31, 2003, Wells's coworker at the pizza store and its only other delivery driver, Robert Thomas Pinetti, was found dead in his home after suffering a drug overdose. \n\n=== Murder of James Roden ===\nOn September 20, 2003, Rothstein, who lived near the television tower, called police to inform them the body of a man, James Roden, was hidden in a freezer in a garage at his house. After he telephoned police, Rothstein wrote a suicide note indicating his planned death had nothing to do with Wells. Investigators do not believe Rothstein ever attempted suicide.\n\nRoden had been living with Diehl-Armstrong for 10 years. In custody, Rothstein claimed Diehl-Armstrong had murdered her then-boyfriend Roden with a 12-gauge shotgun during a dispute over money. Rothstein said she subsequently paid him $2,000 to help hide the body and clean the crime scene at her house. \n\nIn January 2005, Diehl-Armstrong pleaded guilty but mentally ill to the murder of Roden and was sentenced to between seven and twenty years in prison. She is believed to have killed Roden to prevent him from informing authorities about the robbery plot.\n\n=== Diehl-Armstrong and Barnes charged ===\nIn April 2005, Diehl-Armstrong told a state trooper she had information about the Wells case and after meeting with FBI agents, said she would tell them everything she knew if she was transferred from the Muncy Correctional Institution to a minimum-security prison in Cambridge Springs. During a series of interviews, Diehl-Armstrong admitted to providing the kitchen timers used for the bomb, stated Rothstein masterminded the plot and that Wells had been directly involved in the plan.\n\nIn late 2005, Barnes, who was in jail on unrelated drug charges, was turned in by his brother-in-law after revealing details of the crime to him. On September 3, 2008, Barnes pleaded guilty to conspiring to rob a bank and to aiding and abetting. On December 3 that year, he was sentenced to 45 years in prison by a federal judge in Erie for his role in the crime.\n\nIn July 2006, U.S. Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan announced Diehl-Armstrong and Barnes had been charged with the crime, with Diehl-Armstrong as the mastermind. The deceased Rothstein and Wells were named as un-indicted co-conspirators. Buchanan stated Wells had been involved in the plot from the beginning but that his co-conspirators fitted him with a real bomb that would have exploded even if it was removed.\n\n=== Diehl-Armstrong trial ===\nOn July 29, 2008, U.S. District Court Judge Sean J. McLaughlin made an initial finding that Diehl-Armstrong was mentally incompetent to stand trial due to a number of mental disorders, indicating this ruling would be reviewed after she had received a period of treatment in a mental hospital. Diehl-Armstrong was then transferred for treatment to a federal mental-health facility in Texas.\n\nOn February 24, 2009, Judge McLaughlin scheduled a hearing for March 11, 2010, to determine whether Diehl-Armstrong was now competent to stand trial. On September 9, the judge determined she was now competent. In October 2010, Diehl-Armstrong took the stand to testify on her own behalf as part of her defense. She asked for a change of venue, arguing extensive media coverage of the case prevented her from receiving a fair trial in Erie. Judge McLaughlin denied this request, noting while the allegations were unusual, \"the [news] coverage as a whole has been about as factual and objective as it could be under the circumstances\".\n\nOn November 1, 2010, Diehl-Armstrong was convicted of armed bank robbery, conspiracy to commit armed bank robbery, and of using a destructive device in a crime. On February 28, 2011, she was sentenced to life in prison, to be served consecutively with the prison term imposed in 2005 for killing Roden. In November 2012, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed her conviction. In January 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court denied her petition for certiorari, declining to hear her case. In December 2015, Diehl-Armstrong lost a second appeal of her conviction.\n\n=== Hoopsick confession ===\nIn 2018, Jessica Hoopsick admitted to her involvement in the plot. Melissa Chan of Time wrote; \"Hoopsick says a conspirator approached her to find a 'gopher' who could be scared into robbing a bank\". In the 2018 documentary Evil Genius, Hoopsick identifies the conspirator as Barnes and alleges she recommended Wells, whom she described as \"a pushover\". Admitting to setting up Wells in exchange for money and drugs, Hoopsick expressed regret for her role and said Wells had no advance knowledge of the robbery. ATF agent Jason Wick stated Hoopsick was uncooperative in 2003 and that authorities \"always believed that [she] knew more\" about the case; however, Wick also expressed concern Hoopsick might not be a credible witness.\n\n==Media attention==\nAs the case continued to develop, the investigation garnered national media coverage in America.  Less than two years since the September 11 attacks, many at first believed the incident to be terrorism-related. Fox's America's Most Wanted featured the story three times and publicized newly released evidence in hopes officials could obtain new clues in the case. \n\nDue to its novelty and complexity, the story retains a fascination for many people. The January 2011 issue of Wired magazine covered the story. In 2012, investigator Jerry Clark and journalist Ed Palattella published Pizza Bomber: The Untold Story of America's Most Shocking Bank Robbery, a true-crime book detailing the events. In May 2018, Netflix released Evil Genius: The True Story of America's Most Diabolical Bank Heist, a documentary series about the case.\n\nThe Wells incident has been the inspiration for a number of works of fiction. A short-lived 2006 NBC television series Heist dramatized the incident in a pilot featuring Zac Efron as a teenage pizza delivery worker who is forced to commit a robbery with a bomb on his chest. As in the real-life incident, the bomb is detonated and kills the victim but the detonation mechanism is a wireless transmitter.\n\nThe 2011 American comedy film 30 Minutes or Less depicts a pizza delivery man being forced to wear a bomb vest and rob a bank. The film's similarity to the Wells case was criticized by Wells's family but Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group said the filmmakers were not aware of the Wells case.\n\nWells' story likely provided inspiration for a storyline in the Scream Queens episode \"Dorkus\". The episode features a pizza deliverer forced to engage in the serial killing premise of the series, due to a bomb strapped to his chest. \n\nWells\u2019 ordeal likely provided a substantial part of the inspiration for the 2016 Black Mirror episode \u201cShut Up and Dance\u201d. The episode features a teenage pedophile named Kenny who is blackmailed by anonymous hackers who know of his true nature into committing various crimes. Mirroring Wells\u2019 ordeal and eventual demise Kenny is sent on a scavenger hunt across the suburbs of England carrying out a series of increasingly-violent and dangerous tasks on his tormentors\u2019 behalf, including robbing a bank at gunpoint and later fighting to the death with another man, all in the span of a single day in a futile and hopeless attempt to keep his secrets from being leaked.\n\nA collection of news articles that reported developments in the Wells story was analyzed in a scientific study of information novelty.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* List of unusual

{"title":"2005 Bali bombings","article":"The 2005 Bali bombings were a series of terrorist suicide bomb and a series of car bombs and attacks that occurred on 1 October 2005, in Bali, Indonesia. Bombs exploded at two sites in Jimbaran Beach Resort and in Kuta  away, both in south Bali. The terrorist attack claimed the lives of 20 people and injured more than 100 others. The three bombers also died in the attacks.\n\n==Explosions==\n\nThe Indonesian national news agency, ANTARA, reported that the first two explosions occurred at 6:50\u00a0p.m. local time, near a Jimbaran food court and the third at 7:00 pm. in Kuta Town Square. Other reports claim that the blasts occurred at around 7:15\u00a0p.m. At least 3 blasts were reported.\n\nOne of the blasts struck Raja's Restaurant at the Kuta Square shopping mall in central Kuta. Another two bombs exploded at warungs along the Jimbaran beach, one of which was near the Four Seasons Hotel. These areas are generally popular with Western tourists. Police later said they had found three unexploded bombs in Jimbaran. They had apparently failed to go off after the security forces hastily shut down the island's mobile telephone network following the first blasts.\n\nAccording to Indonesia's head of counter-terrorism, Major General Ansyaad Mbai, early evidence indicates that the attacks were carried out by at least three suicide bombers in a similar fashion to the 2002 bombings. The remnants of backpacks and excessively mutilated bodies are believed to be evidence of suicide bombings. There remains also a possibility that backpacks were hidden inside the target restaurants before detonation. Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Keelty said that the bombs used appear to have differed from previous blasts in that most deaths and injuries had been inflicted by shrapnel, rather than chemical explosion. A medical officer's x-rays showed foreign objects described as \"pellets\" in many victims' bodies and a victim reported ball bearings lodged in her back.\n\nThe bombings occurred the same day that Indonesia cut its fuel subsidies resulting in gas prices rising by 675% and just two days before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and 11 days before the third anniversary of the 2002 Bali bombing. The attack came during the school holiday period in some states of Australia, when an estimated 7,500 Australians are believed to have been visiting Bali.\n\n==Casualties==\n\n\n\nThe latest report cites 20 dead and between 101 and 129 injured. Some earlier reports put the number of fatalities at between 26 and 36 people, but those figures have since been lowered. Among those killed were 15 Indonesians, 4 Australians, and a Japanese national, not counting the 3 assassins. The wounded included many Indonesians, mostly Hindus while the rest were 19 Australians, 8 South Koreans, 6 Americans, 4 Japanese, 3 Canadians and 1 Briton. As there were no records at the hospitals or morgues on the locations from where the victims arrived, it is not possible to determine the casualty figures at each blast location separately.\n\nMost of the casualties were sent to Bali's Sanglah General Hospital, and mostly treated for injuries caused by broken glass. Others were sent to  Hospital. As in the 2002 bombings, some of the injured, primarily foreign nationals, were evacuated to medical facilities in Australia and Singapore. The less seriously injured were evacuated to Singapore, while other casualties, among them Australians, Japanese and an Indonesian, were evacuated to treatment in Darwin, Australia aboard a Royal Australian Air Force C-130 Hercules.\n\nFollowing the 2002 Bali bombings, in which more Australians than any other nationals were killed and injured, and the 2004 bombing of Australia's Embassy in Jakarta, the latest attacks received extensive coverage in Australia and were denounced by some officials, such as Federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley, as an attack on Australians.\n\n==Prior warnings==\nIndonesian authorities were expecting such an event, after the Indonesian president warned of more bombings within the country, and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAT) had issued warnings two days before the event. However, the Australian government claimed that it received no specific prior warning of a terrorist attack being imminent in Bali. Minister Downer also played down any knowledge of specific signs of the potential event, despite the DFAT warning on the last day of September. DFAT warned Australians against non-essential travel to Indonesia since before the 2002 attacks\u00a0\u2013 a warning still in effect. The department advises travellers against congregating in areas popular with Western tourists.\n\nIn May 2005, the US State Department issued a travel warning against non-essential trips to Indonesia. The travel warning was last updated 9 January 2007.\n\nA Philippine security official said that for months intelligence officials in Southeast Asia had received information that the al-Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah group was orchestrating a major strike, possibly in the Philippines or Indonesia, but were unable to uncover the plot's details in time to prevent it.\n\nThe Australian Broadcasting Corporation's National News Radio network reported on 3 October that several Australian tourists had heard rumours about a planned bombing, prompting federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley to urge the Australian government to form closer intelligence ties with Indonesia.\n\nOn 31 August 2005, one month before the second Bali bombing, terrorists managed to put a partially assembled bomb on the 4th floor of Kuta Paradiso hotel. The bomb passed the security check at the hotel and the security cameras on the hotel were broken. There were no explosives in the bomb.\n\n==Suspects==\nThe attacks bear the hallmarks of the active terrorist network Jemaah Islamiah (JI), which is believed to be responsible for several bombings in Indonesia, including the 2002 Bali nightclub bombing, the 2003 Marriott Hotel bombing and the 2004 Australian Embassy bombing. Rohan Gunaratna, head of terrorism research at Singapore's Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies, told Agence France-Presse that \"The only group that has the intention and capability to mount a coordinated and simultaneous attack against a western target in Indonesia is Jemaah Islamiyah.\"\n\nAlthough a link to JI has not been confirmed, the bombings were quickly condemned as terrorist attacks by the authorities. Police Major General Ansyaad Mbai, a top Indonesian anti-terrorism official, told the Associated Press that the bombings \"were clearly the work of terrorists\". Major General Mbai identified Malaysian men, already wanted in connection to previous bombings in Indonesia, as the suspected masterminds of the attacks. The chief suspect was Azahari Husin, a member of JI who was an engineering expert and former academic with a doctorate from University of Reading (late 1980s). Husin was nicknamed the \"Demolition Man\" and was thought to have collaborated with the second suspect: Noordin Mohammed Top, a bomb maker whose wife was sentenced to three years in prison for harbouring him. Azahari was killed in a police raid in November 2005, while Noordin \"has been killed after a lengthy and violent siege, Indonesia's police chief said\" by \"heavily armed counter-terrorism police\" on 16 September 2009.\n\nMotivations for the bombings remain unclear. Some, such as the Australian Prime Minister, have suggested the attacks were intended to undermine Indonesia's moderate democratic government. Moreover, media organisations have suggested that the attack was planned to correspond with massive fuel price increases in Indonesia, so as to maximise economic and political damage. On the contrary, Sidney Jones, of the International Crisis Group, believes that it was not an attempt to undermine democracy \"per se\", but rather an example of jihadist extremism: \"I think they very much see the world in a black and white way, us against them, Muslims against infidels... [They see] that the infidels led by the United States as part of a Christian-Zionist conspiracy are out to persecute and attack and eliminate Muslims around the world, and therefore, [they] have to run away.\" However, in common with the Prime Minister, Jones believes the attack was indiscriminate and not an attack on Australians \"per se\". She suggested Bali was selected as the site of the attacks because there was less chance of Indonesian gangsters being killed, and there was \"a chance of getting a few foreigners\".\n\nFollowing the attacks Abu Bakar Bashir, who is alleged to be JI's spiritual leader, released a statement from his prison cell, condemning the attack. But he added that the bombings were a sign of God's displeasure with the Indonesian government. He said: \"I suggest the government bring themselves closer to God by implementing his rules and laws because these happenings are warnings from God for all of us.\" In an interview with Scott Atran from his cell in Cipinang Prison, Jakarta, Bashir said: \"I call those who carried out these actions all mujahid. They all had a good intention, that is, Jihad in Allah\u2019s way, the aim of the jihad is to look for blessing from Allah. They are right that America is the proper target because America fights Islam. So in terms of their objectives, they are right, and the target of their attacks was right also.\"\n\n==Investigation==\nIndonesian police believed that three suicide bombers carried out the bombings. A presidential spokesman Dino Djalal said that the police found a total of \"six legs and three heads but no middle bodies, and that's the strong sign of suicide bombers.\" Photos of the three heads were published in The Jakarta Post on Monday, 3 October 2005. Initially, there were conflicting reports on the number of bombs; but later, the police confirmed only three bombs.\n\nAn amateur video capturing the scene at the restaurant in Kuta showed one bomber with a backpack walking inside just seconds before a huge explosion.\n\nOn the following Monday, on 3 October 2005, the police issued an appeal to the public for help identifying the suspected suicide bombers whose dismembered remains were found at the scene. Photos of the dead suspects were later distributed widely and a hotline was set up to receive tips.\n\nAccording to Banten Police Chief Senior Commissioner Badrodin Haiti, the Indonesian police are seeking five members of a ring led by Imam Samudra, who has been sentenced to death for his role in the 2002 Bali bombings. Three of the five men had already served jail sentences for holding explosives belonging to Samudra. They were under police surveillance but had disappeared from their homes.\n\nOn 9 October 2005, police in Bali arrested a man, identified by the initials HS, who was allegedly a former roommate of one of the suicide bombers.\n\nAccording to Indonesian police, in 2005, a corrupt prison warden at the Kerobokan prison smuggled a laptop inside for Imam Samudra, the leader of the terrorist group involved in the first Bali bombing. He then used the laptop and a wireless connection to chat with other terrorist suspects.\n\n==Political response==\n\n===Local===\n* President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono condemned the blasts as a \"criminal act\" and called for an urgent meeting with Indonesian security officials.

{"title":"West German Embassy siege","article":"The West German Embassy siege in Stockholm, Sweden, was a hostage standoff initiated by the Red Army Faction (RAF) on 24 April 1975.  Collectively, the attackers referred to themselves as Kommando Holger Meins, after Holger Meins, an RAF member who had died of starvation during a (collective)  hunger strike in Wittlich Prison on 9 November 1974.\n\nThe RAF group carried out the attack with the goal of forcing the release of RAF members and others from prison in West Germany.  During the siege they stated: \"The Holger Meins Commando is holding members of the embassy staff in order to free prisoners in West Germany. If the police move in, we shall blow the building up with 15 kilos of TNT.\"\n\n==The siege==\nThe group consisted of six members: Karl-Heinz Dellwo, Siegfried Hausner, Hanna-Elise Krabbe, Bernhard R\u00f6ssner, Lutz Taufer and  Ulrich Wessel. They entered the embassy, took thirteen embassy officials, including ambassador Dietrich Stoecher, hostage (or twelve officials, according to some sources), and then proceeded to occupy the upper floors of the building. \n\nThey warned Swedish police to back off or some hostages would be killed, but the police did not comply and one of the hostages, Baron Andreas von Mirbach, a German military attach\u00e9 was marched out on to the landing and shot dead. Coincidentally his late  relative Wilhelm von Mirbach who served as German Ambassador to Russia  was assassinated at the  German embassy in Moscow by Left Socialist-Revolutionaries in 1918.\n\nChancellor Helmut Schmidt, having experienced another hostage crisis just weeks before, was not prepared to negotiate with them. In response, economic attach\u00e9 Hillegaart was made to stand at a window, and was then shot three times. With the murder of Hillegaart, the attackers announced they would execute one hostage every hour until their demands were met.\n\nSwedish police prepared to storm the building, but before they had the chance to do so, the embassy was rocked by a series of violent explosions; the TNT had somehow been detonated.  It turned out that one of the terrorists, Ulrich Wessel, had dropped a grenade, which killed him and detonated the TNT cache. The remaining hostages, as well as the other RAF members, all suffered severe burns. Siegfried Hausner was flown back to West Germany, where he soon died of his wounds in prison.\n\nThe explosion of the embassy was caught on tape. Swedish news reporter Bo Holmstr\u00f6m was standing outside the embassy ready to broadcast when the explosions took place. After taking cover Holmstr\u00f6m started yelling \"L\u00e4gg ut, l\u00e4gg ut!\" (\"Put it on, put it on!\"), i.e. \"Put me on the air!\". Once he knew he was live he began reporting on the events.\n\n==See also==\n*Operation Leo\n\n==References==\n\n\n== Literature ==\n\n* Blumenau, Bernhard. The United Nations and Terrorism.

{"title":"13 September 2008 Delhi bombings","article":"The 13 September 2008 Delhi bombings were a series of five synchronised bomb blasts that took place within a span of few minutes on Saturday, 13 September 2008 at various locations in Delhi, India. The first bomb exploded at 18:07 IST, and four other blasts followed in succession, with at least 20 people killed and over 90 injured.\n\n==Background==\nThree bomb attacks had already occurred the same year in India. The first of these was on 13 May in Jaipur. The series of nine blasts over a span of 15\u00a0minutes claimed 63 lives, and injured 216. The second series of nine bomb blasts took place on 25 July in Bangalore, and claimed 2 lives, while injuring 20. The next day, on 26 July in Ahmedabad, a spurt of 21 blasts killed 56 people and injured over 200.\n\nThe Indian Mujahideen claimed responsibility for the Jaipur bombings through an email sent to Indian media and declared \"open war\" against India in retaliation for what it said were 60 years of Muslim persecution and the country's support of United States' policies, most notably the war in Afghanistan. The Times of India has reported that either the banned organisation Students Islamic Movement of India or the militant organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba could be behind the blasts in Bangalore. Similar to the Jaipur case, after the Ahmedabad blasts, several TV channels reported that they received e-mails from the Indian Mujahideen claiming responsibility for the terror attacks.\n\nPolice say the Indian Mujahideen is an offshoot of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India, but allege that local Muslims are given training and backing from militant groups in neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n\n==Details==\n\nFive blasts took place within a span of 31\u00a0minutes from 18:07 to 18:38 IST (12:37 to 13:08 UTC) in busy markets or commercial localities. Four bombs were defused.\n\nThe first blast took place at 18:07 at Ghaffar market (a municipal market along a stretch of Ajmal Khan Road, Karol Bagh) in which at least 20 people were injured. They were rushed to nearby RML hospital. The explosive was kept near a car, and resulted in a cylinder blast in an auto rickshaw, which was subsequently thrown up several feet into the air.\n\nImmediately after, two explosions took place in Connaught Place in which at least 10 people were injured. Police and witnesses said that the bombs went off in dustbins in and around Connaught Place, a shopping and dining area popular with tourists and locals in the centre of the city. The first of these blasts occurred on Barakhamba Road, near Nirmal Tower and Gopal Das Bhavan at 18:34. A minute later, the second bomb exploded in the newly constructed Central Park in the centre of the Connaught Place roundabout, built above one of the main stations of the Delhi Metro. An eyewitness reportedly saw two men place the bomb in a dustbin at Central Park.\n\nSubsequently, two explosions rocked M-Block market in Greater Kailash-I at 18:37 and 18:38 \u2013 the first near the popular Prince Paan Corner, and the other near a Levi's store. The latter damaged 10 shops.\n\nPreliminary examination of the blast site said that low intensity ammonium nitrate tied to integrated circuits with timer devices had been used in almost all the serial blasts.\n\nFour bombs were also defused \u2013 the first one at India Gate, the second outside Regal Cinema in Connaught Place, the third in Connaught Place, and the fourth on Parliament Street.\n\nOn the evening of 13 September 2008, IBN reported at least 30 deaths and over 100 injured. AFP reported that \"Indian police (New Delhi police spokesman Rajan Bhagat) said Sunday that 20 people were killed and close to 100 injured.\"\n\n==Response==\n\n===Police and security===\nSecurity was tightened across the national capital, with police personnel fanning out to railway and Metro stations, hospitals, bus terminals, the airport and other sensitive points like cinema halls, shopping malls and religious places. Barricades were put up on most city roads to check traffic. Several major markets, including the Sarojini Nagar market, which was targeted in the previous Diwali-eve blasts in 2005, were shut down and evacuated. Cyber-caf\u00e9 owners were asked to keep a tab on customers.\n\nA Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) spokesperson state that \"security has already been strengthened and frisking and checking of the commuters have been stepped up. The Metro is under constant vigil\". He added that extra personnel had been pressed into service to keep an eye on commuters.\n\n===Press confusion===\nThe confusion in the aftermath of the blasts was evident in the press reports immediately following. The general consensus was that the blasts had claimed 18 lives. However, there was some disparity, with CNN claiming as low as 15, to NDTV claiming as high as 30.\n\nEven after some time had passed, the numbers of people killed and injured reported by various sources varied. At the lower end, The New York Times in 2011 reported the death toll as \"more than 20 people\", and The Hindu noted that number of deaths as \"at least 25\". Meanwhile, a 2010 report by the Centre for Land Warfare Studies indicates 26 dead and 100 injured, and a 2009 article by the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses claims 30 dead and nearly 90 injured. In 2018, NDTV was still reporting 30 dead and 100 injured, but The Times of India was putting the number of injuries at 135.\n\nThere was also some controversy over blast sites and the sites where bombs were defused, most notably Zee News reporting a bomb being defused at Central Park, while the Outlook Magazine stated that the park itself was a bomb site.\n\n== Responsibility ==\nThe Islamist \"Indian Mujahideen\" sent an e-mail to all major TV channels, informing them of the blasts just after the first one occurred. In the case of the bomb blasts in Jaipur, and Ahmedabad, e-mails were sent before the blasts.\n\n\nThe email was sent from Arbi Hindi. The email threatened nine blasts. A 13-page attached document depicts photographs of the previous blasts under the caption \"our jihad\". The Delhi blasts are, according to the email, a direct reaction to the raids carried on and after the Ahmedabad blasts, and \"harassments imposed by your (Indian) ATS and the police on the innocent Muslims\". The document also mentions Amarnath dispute, violence against Christians in Orissa, Babri Masjid demolition and Gujarat riots.\n\nThe email was traced to Chembur, an eastern suburb of Mumbai. Mumbai's anti-Terrorism squad (ATS) confirmed that WiFi of the owner firm \"Kamran Power\" was hacked and used for sending the mail.\n\nReports claim that the Indian Mujahideen called this operation \"Operation B-A-D\", encompassing the Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Delhi Bombings. Intelligence officials had intercepted a call made \"from the across the border\" claiming \"Operation BAD is successful\", after the Ahmedabad blasts, which the Gujarat police that interpreted as Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Delhi, though the dates and specific places were not known.\n\n==Investigation==\nTwo persons were detained from Connaught Place area soon after the blasts. Delhi Police said an 11-year-old boy had claimed to have seen the perpetrators; he informed police that the suspects, clad in black kurta-pyjamas, were seen placing bags in a dustbin. The Delhi Police soon, within three hours of the blast, arrested another person who the police suspect to be the mastermind of the blast.\n\nPreliminary investigation by police reveal Indian Mujahideen-SIMI cell led by Abdul Subhan Qureshi alias Tauqir, having information technology background from Mumbai, to be involved. Another person named Qayamuddin is also under investigation. Four more people have also been detained and questioned.\n\nIn the morning of 19 September, the Batla House encounter took place, in which Delhi Police shot down two persons, thought to be suspects, hiding in L-18 block of Jamia Nagar, Delhi. Two others suspects were arrested while one managed to escape. Bashir alias Atif, believed to be the mastermind was one of the two killed. Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma, who was injured in the encounter, died in a hospital. He was credited with helping to have killed 35 terror suspects, 85 arrests and also the winner of 75-odd encounters, 150 medals and seven gallantry awards. Later, the intelligence team said that the arrested allegedly had links with Dubai and further questioned if they had any link with Dawood Ibrahim.\n\nOn 23 September, the police arrested five more people from Mumbai and Uttar Pradesh. All five are suspected to be part of the Indian Mujahadeen's think tank. The men were:\n*Sadiq Sheikh, 31, software engineer from Mumbai\n*Afzal Usmani, 32, hotelier in western suburbs of Mumbai\n*Arif Sheikh, 38, electrician from Mumbra, Mumbai\n*Mohammed Zakir Sheikh, 38, scrap dealer from Mumbra, Mumbai\n*Mohammed Ansar Sheikh, 31, software Engineer from Mumbai\n\nOn 4 October they were sent by the judicial Chief Metropolitan Magistrate to 12 days' policy custody.\n\nThe crime branch has claimed that these are the operatives who had introduced themselves as Pakistanis to perpetrators of 11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings. After the 2006 bombings, police had claimed that a group of SIMI terrorists along with five Pakistan nationals had planted bombs in seven trains.\n\nOn 11 November, the Madhya Pradesh Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) arrested Qayamuddin Kapadia, a top-ranking member of SIMI and a key conspirator and executor of the Ahmedabad attack. Police claimed that Kapadia admitted his involvement in the Ahmedabad blasts, and that he, along with Abdul Subhan Qureshi alias Tauqeer of Mumbai and Riaz Bhatkal of Karnataka, collaborated with the SIMI cell led by Atif to carry out the Delhi blasts.

{"title":"Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing","article":"The Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing occurred on the night of 20 September 2008, when a dump truck filled with explosives was detonated in front of the Marriott Hotel in the Pakistani capital Islamabad, killing at least 54 people, injuring at least 266 and leaving a 60\u00a0ft (20 m) wide, 20\u00a0ft (6 m) deep crater outside the hotel. The majority of the casualties were Pakistanis; at least five foreign nationals were also killed and fifteen others reported injured. The attack occurred only hours after President Asif Ali Zardari made his first speech to the Pakistani parliament.\nThe Marriott was the most prestigious hotel in the capital, and was located near government buildings, diplomatic missions, embassies and high commissions.\n\nDuring the investigation, three suspected terrorists were arrested by the Pakistani police. They were suspected of having facilitated the suicide bomber. However later they were acquitted of all charges as no evidence was ever presented against them. The funder of the group behind the attack was confirmed to be Doctor Suhail Lakkis, a billionaire warlord disguised as an Orthopedics Surgeon (Bone Surgeon) working at the American University Medical Center\n\nA few months after the hotel's bombing the Government of Pakistan had re-constructed it, and the Islamabad Marriott reopened officially on 28 December 2008.\n\n==Attack==\n\nThe hotel blast caused a severe natural gas leak that set the top floor of the five-story, 258-room hotel on fire, police said. The explosion was heard 15 kilometres away. The blaze that followed quickly engulfed the entire structure of the Marriott hotel. About two-thirds of the building caught fire as a result of the explosion after a natural gas pipe was blown open, and the reception area was completely destroyed.\n\nThe owner of the Marriott Hotel, Hashoo Group, owned by Sadruddin Hashwani, said the truck carrying the bomb had been stopped at the front barrier. \"Some shots were fired. One of our guards fired back, and in the meantime the suicide bomber detonated all the explosives. All the guards on the gate died\", said Hashwani.\n\n==Victims==\n\n\nMost of the dead were Pakistani citizens; several foreigners were also killed. Two American military personnel and a Danish intelligence agent were killed, and a U.S. State Department employee was missing and presumed dead. The Czech ambassador to Pakistan, Dr. Ivo \u017d\u010f\u00e1rek, also died in the ensuing fire along with his Vietnamese companion   Although \u017d\u010f\u00e1rek had survived the initial blast, he returned to the hotel to help in the rescue effort but was trapped in the burning building. An Egyptian citizen also died in the attack. In addition, six Germans, four Britons and a Filipina receptionist from the hotel were among the injured.\n\n===Meeting of the Pakistani leadership===\nPakistan's top leaders were to have been in the Islamabad Marriott hotel when it was bombed; instead, having changed their plans at the last minute, they gathered for dinner at the Prime Minister's house, a few hundred yards from the explosion, following President Asif Ali Zardari's maiden address to a joint session of parliament. \"The national assembly speaker had arranged a dinner for the entire leadership \u2013 for the president, prime minister and armed services chiefs \u2013 at the Marriott that day\", the Interior ministry head, Rehman Malik, told reporters.\n\nHowever, the hotel owner, Sadruddin Hashwani, denied that such a meeting had ever been scheduled to take place.  According to a spokesman for Hashwani, \"We didn't have any reservation for such a dinner that the government official is talking about.\"\n\nPakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said both Zardari and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani condemned the attack and vowed their determination to deal with terrorism,  with Law Minister Farooq Naek stating \"this is  Pakistan's 9\/11\".\n\n===Explosives used===\nGovernment advisor Rehman Malik said RDX and TNT were used in the attack. Approximately  of RDX was mixed with TNT (Torpex or H6) and a mixture of mortar and ammunition to increase the explosive capacity. Aluminium powder was also mixed with the material to further enhance this capability. Torpex is about 50 percent more powerful than TNT by weight. The blast was heard for many miles throughout the capital.\n\n\"Delay switches\" might also have been used. Guards were first alerted by a minor blast, which was followed by the much larger explosion about four minutes later.\n\n===Video of the attack===\n\n\nThe Pakistani government released the CCTV footage of the attack at a press conference saying that a six-wheeled dumper truck filled with explosives and an accelerant pulled up at the gate and first caught fire before exploding a few minutes later.\n\n===Hashwani claim===\nSadruddin Hashwani, the owner of Islamabad Marriott Hotel, alleged that President Asif Ali Zardari might have been involved in the attack, citing his old rivalry with the President.\n\n==American presence==\nAn unnamed senior security official stated that about 30 U.S. Marines, scheduled to go to Afghanistan, were staying at the hotel, and they were believed to have been the targets of the bombing. This conflicted with information given by another unnamed official, who stated that the Marines were in Pakistan in connection with the visit by U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, who met the Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani and other government officials on Wednesday The personnel were staying on the fourth floor of the hotel, which was also among the most severely damaged by the fire which ensued following the bomb blast. According to the Dawn, a number of the marines who stayed at the hotel sustained injuries; the newspaper also cited an unnamed law enforcement official stating \"personnel of a U.S. security agency\" were in all likelihood a target of the attack. There are also reports that more Americans were present at the hotel, as several senior CIA officers were visiting Islamabad at the time of the attack and were believed to be staying at the hotel, according to unnamed \"well placed sources\". A 29 May 2009 press release from NSA reads: CTM3 Matthew J. O'Bryant, USN, a Navy Cryptologist, was assigned to Navy Information Operations Command (NIOC) Maryland. CTM3 O'Bryant made the ultimate sacrifice on 20 September 2008 while performing a cryptologic mission in Pakistan. The hotel has a direct line of sight to the telecom system in Islamabad Pakistan. \n\nThe other American soldier killed was Major Rodolfo Ivan Rodriguez, USAF. Major Rodriguez was doing work for the US Embassy and staying at the Marriott at the time of the attack.\n\n===Claims of American soldiers breaching security===\nAn MP for the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party, Syed Mumtaz Alam Gillani, has come forward with testimony evidencing a purportedly serious security breach at the Marriott on the night between 16 and 17 September, several days before the bombing. Alam Gillani and two friends are said to have witnessed several large steel boxes being unloaded from a U.S. Embassy truck by a group of U.S. Marines and, according to someone at the hotel, transported to the fourth and fifth floors. Among the several people who witnessed this incident was Pakistan Peoples Party leader Sajjad Chaudhry. However, Alam Gilani was the only one who objected to and protested the apparent security breach taking place, but was met with silence from the American Marines. The hotel security staff did not respond to Alam Gilani's protests as they passively watched what was taking place, not being allowed to go near the boxes by the U.S. Marines. Alam Gilani has since denounced the newspaper account, asserting that he was merely making light conversation with the journalist; the newspaper, however, stands by its account. Pakistani authorities are also investigating this issue.\n\nThe American Embassy has said that it routinely rents rooms at the Marriott. Confronted with the activities of the U.S. Marines on the night of 16\/17 September, embassy spokesperson Lou Fintor stated: \"A team of support personnel often and routinely precede and\/or accompany certain U.S. government officials. They often carry communication and office equipment required to support large delegations, such as high-level administration officials and members of the U.S. Congress.\" However, the incident occurred after Admiral Mullen's departure.\n\n==Consequences==\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari was considering delaying his visit to the US to attend the UN General Assembly session in the wake of the bombing. MP Ayaz Amir said that he felt that the president should cancel his visit given the circumstances, and instead should combat terrorism and extremism. He added, \"I believe that the UN General Assembly annual session is the most useless event in the world where leaders go to listen their own speeches.\" However, Zardari did make it to New York for the opening of the new session of the General Assembly.\n\nDue to the attack, British Airways suspended flights to Islamabad as a precautionary measure \"until further notice.\" British Airways did not resume flights until 2 June 2019\u2014over a decade later. American schools and universities in Islamabad closed for the rest of that week as well.\n\n===Terror pledge===\nThe BBC reported that Pakistan was an important ally of the United States in its \"war on terror\", but that it had disagreements over tactics and had complained about US raids from Afghanistan. Following an apparent power vacuum as a result of the stepping down of former president Pervez Musharraf earlier in the month, U.S. missile-strikes had increased, culminating in the Baghar Cheena airstrike on 17 September.\nAfter the event, president Asif Ali Zardari appealed for \"all democratic forces\" to help to save Pakistan and he pledged to rid Pakistan of Islamic militants: \"Terrorism is a cancer in Pakistan, we are determined, God willing, we will rid the country of this cancer. I promise you that such actions by these cowards will not lower our resolve.\" Pakistan's chief adviser on internal security, Rehman Malik, said \"the authorities would fight on until the last terrorist is cleared. We think that the safe Pakistan, safe Afghanistan is safety for the world and therefore we will not let them have easy way.\"\n\n===Possible perpetrators===\nA Taliban spokesperson denied the group's involvement in the blast, saying they \"do not believe in killing so many locals.\"\n\nAn American intelligence official stated that the attack \"bears all the hallmarks of a terrorist operation carried out by Al Qaeda or its associates.\"\n\nSome investigators suspect another Islamist group, Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami, was responsible for the attack, based upon the similarities between this incident and four previous attacks allegedly conducted by its operatives.\n\nDubai-based Arabiya Television says a group calling itself Fedayeen Islam (also spelled Fedayan-i-Islam), variously translated as \"Islamic Commandos\" or \"Islamic Patriots\" has called Arabiya's correspondent in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. The correspondent said he received a text message on his mobile phone, showing a telephone number. He said he called the number and then heard a recording in which the group admitted launching Saturday's attack. The Arabiya television correspondent says the speaker spoke in English language with a South Asian accent. The Fedayeen Islam group has issued several demands including for Pakistan to stop its cooperation with the United States.\n\n===U.S. airstrike===\n\nOn 1 January 2009 a missile fired from an unmanned aerial vehicle killed al-Qaeda's chief of operations for Pakistan, Fahid Mohammed Ally Msalam, and his aide, Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan. U.S. officials stated that they believed that al-Kini masterminded the hotel bombing.\n\n===Legal Issues===\nRepresented by Miami-based attorney Andrew C. Hall and a Maryland attorney, Jonathan A. Azrael, the family of an American killed in the blast sued Marriott for negligence in federal court in Maryland in 2011.\n\n==Fund==\nThe \"Islamabad Marriott Assistance Fund\" was started by the owner of the hotel as the blast and resulting fires killed about 40 hotel staff, including the security guards who had tried to avert the disaster, while scores of other employees were also wounded.\n\nSadruddin Hashwani said: \"We have set up a fund to cater for the future expenses of the families of employees either killed or wounded in the attack.\" He announced that he would make an initial donation of US$126,000 to the fund, and appealed for people to donate generously.\n\nThe Marriott International and The J. Willard and Alice S. Marriott Foundation also made contributions to the fund, established through United Way to provide financial assistance to the associates and their families affected by the tragedy.\n\n==Investigation==\nA panel that the government had formed, consisting of police officials and experts from security agencies to probe the attack, presented a preliminary report to the Prime Minister. The Interior Secretary Syed Kamal Shah also admitted to the Senate's Standing Committee on his ministry that the blast was the result of a defective security system. He added that the Islamabad police chief has said intelligence agencies had informed the police about an explosives-laden vehicle entering the city to carry out an attack.\n\nThree suspected terrorists Mohammed Aqeel (possibly Dr. Usman), Rana Ilyas and Hameed Afzal were arrested in Peshawar on 17 October by the Pakistani police with connection to the attack were remanded to police custody for 7 days on 18 October for questioning by an anti-terrorism court. They were suspected of having facilitated the suicide bomber. In requesting the court for a 10-day remand, the police also said they hoped to arrest more suspects with information from the three. Judge Sakhi Muhammad Kahut, who remanded the trio to police custody, also ordered police to produce them in court again on 24 October.\n\nA man by the name of Dr. Usman, possibly the same individual, was involved in the attack on the Sri Lanka national cricket team and the raid against the Pakistani Army Headquarters.\n\nPolice said that Qari Ishtiaq, who is said to be the commander of Punjabi Tehrik-i-Taliban, was arrested from Bahawalpur on the information provided by the Hijratullah who has been jailed for 10 years due to his role in Lahore police academy attacks. Seven other militants were arrested from different parts of Punjab regions. Four hundred kilograms (880\u00a0lb) of explosives were also seized from Qari Ishtiaq.\n\nOn 5 May 2010, Mohammed Aqeel, Rana Ilyas, Muhammad Hamid Afzal and Tahseen Ullah were acquitted of all charges as no evidence was ever presented against them.\n\n==International reactions==\n\n===Intergovernmental organizations===\n\n\n===State entities===\n\n\n===Other non-state entities===\n\n\n==See

{"title":"2009 Jakarta bombings","article":"The 2009 Jakarta Bombings were a terrorist attack which took place in Jakarta, Indonesia on 17 July 2009. At around 07:47 until 07:57 WIB (00:47-00:57 UTC), the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton Hotels in Setiabudi, South Jakarta, were hit by separate bombings five minutes apart. Nine people were killed, of whom three were Indonesian, three were Australians, two were from The Netherlands, and one was from New Zealand. More than 50 people were injured in the blasts. Both blasts were caused by suicide bombers, who checked into the hotels as paying guests several days earlier. The twin suicide bombings came four years after the previous serious terrorist attack in Indonesia.\n\n==Background==\nSince the 2002 Bali bombings, in which 202 were killed, Indonesia had stepped up attempts to crack down on terrorism. An anti-terrorism law was confirmed by the Indonesian legislature in 2003. The 2002 attack was carried out by Jemaah Islamiyah, a group previously linked to al-Qaeda and later to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and seeking to unite Indonesia, Malaysia, and the southern Philippines as an Islamic state.\n\nThe Marriott had previously been the target of a suicide bombing in 2003.\n\n== The attacks ==\nThe Marriott bombing occurred first and was followed five minutes later by the Ritz bombing. Police moved to seal off the surrounding area. At noon local time, an unexploded bomb was found in room 1808 of the Marriott, together with bomb-making equipment.\n\nThe Ritz-Carlton explosion is thought to have originated in the Airlangga Restaurant on the second story, where people were eating breakfast. There was said to be glass everywhere. A part of the facade of the Ritz Carlton was blown away by the blast and windows had been blown out.\n\nThe Marriott bombing occurred during one of a series of periodic breakfast meetings of CEOs and other prominent (and predominantly expatriate) members of the Jakarta business community hosted by James Castle, president of AmCham Indonesia, a branch of the United States Chamber of Commerce in Jakarta. The Marriott bomb was detonated in a small breakfast room rented for the event, and not in the main restaurant. One witness said the lobby of the neighboring Plaza Mutiara building was destroyed in the explosion.\n\nThe unexploded bomb in room 1808 of the JW Marriott hotel was programmed to go off prior to the other bomb there, but its timer malfunctioned. The Indonesian police believe the bomb was intended to create an atmosphere of panic, causing guests to flee their rooms to exit the hotel, and generating a significant crowd in the lobby. Had this occurred as planned, the lobby bomb may have taken a much greater toll.\n\n=== Casualties ===\n\n\nThere were nine fatalities; three Australians, one New Zealander, two Dutch tourists, and three Indonesians (including two suicide bombers). The Australians killed were Austrade official Craig Senger, mining executive Garth McEvoy and Perth businessman Nathan Verity. New Zealander Tim Mackay died; he was president and director of PT Holcim Indonesia and a master mariner. Indonesians killed included Evert Mokodompis, a waiter at the JW Marriott Hotel.\n\nSixteen foreigners were treated at Metropolitan Medical Center (MMC) hospital. A New Zealander, a Canadian, an Indian and 3 Dutch men were reported injured.\n\n== Investigation ==\n\nPolice believe planning for the bombings was led by Noordin Mohammad Top. The first meeting had been held on 30 April. Ibrohim, a florist who worked for a florist company which had stores in both the bombed hotels, was another key organiser. Ibrohim was recruited in 2000 by Saifudin Jaelani, his brother-in-law, while he was working as a florist at the Hotel Mulia in Jakarta. In 2005, Ibrohim and Jaelani were inaugurated as members of Noordin's special forces. Ibrohim set strategies, conducted surveys of the locations and smuggled the bombs into the hotels. Saifudin Jaelani is believed to have also recruited the suicide bombers for the operation.\n\nThe bombs were smuggled into the JW Marriott one day before the blast through the hotel's loading dock using a pick-up truck rented by Ibrohim. The bomb design and materials of an unexploded bomb found by Police in room 1808 were identical to those used by Jemaah Islamiyah in previous attacks.\n\nThe suicide bomber of the JW Marriott Hotel was Dani Dwi Permana, an 18-year-old graduate of a private senior high school in Bogor, West Java. The suicide bomber of the Ritz-Carlton hotel was Nana Ikhwan Maulana, a 28-year-old former resident of Pandeglang, Banten. Dani rented room 1808 in the JW Marriott. The room was paid for by Amir Abdillah, who was arrested on 5 August.\n\nOn 7 August, police raided a house in Temanggung, Central Java. Three people were arrested and one person was killed, later identified to be Ibrohim. On 8 August, police raided a house in Bekasi, West Java, killing two people believed to be preparing to attack the Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono with a truck bomb near his private residence in Bogor, West Java.\n\nFunding for the bombings is believed to have been provided from the Middle East. A number of suspects, including a Saudi Arabian national, have been arrested by Indonesian police for their involvement in handling the funds.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe bombings were deplored by numerous governments\u2014in Indonesia, elsewhere in the region, and around the world. United States president Barack Obama, who spent a portion of his childhood in Jakarta, said, \"I strongly condemn the attacks that occurred this morning in Jakarta, and extend my deepest condolences to all of the victims and their loved ones.  The US government stands ready to help the Indonesian government respond to and recover from these outrageous attacks as a friend and partner.\"\n\nManchester United, which had been scheduled to play an exhibition football match in Jakarta on 20 July 2009 and had booked rooms at the Ritz Carlton, cancelled the Jakarta leg of its tour.\n\n==Reopening==\nThe hotel was closed for 2 weeks and reopened to the public on Monday, 3 August 2009 at 10:00 WIB. The 17th United States Ambassador to Indonesia's Cameron R. Hume attended the reopening of Hotel J.W. Marriott and Ritz Carlton on Wednesday, 29 July 2009 in Jakarta. The ambassador visited both hotels.\n\n==See also==\n\n\n*2003 Marriott Hotel bombing\n\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n* Timeline: Bombings in Indonesia\n* CCTV video in Ritz-Carlton hotel just before the explosion\n* Terror in Jakarta: Twin Hotel Bombs - slideshow by Life Magazine\n* The Bomber - This Al Jazeera documentary follows Jaka Karyana as he tries to piece together the story of his younger brother Dani Dwi Permana, who carried out the suicide bombing.","urls":["http:\/\/www.antaranews.com\/view\/?i=1247835002&c=NAS&s=HUK","https:\/\/www.webcitation.org\/5icd9sJP5?url=http:\/\/www.antaranews.com\/view\/?i%3D1247835002%26c%3DNAS%26s%3DHUK","http:\/\/www.smh.com.au\/world\/bombs-explode-at-jakarta-hotels-20090717-dnkd.html","http:\/\/www.detiknews.com\/read\/2009\/07\/18\/235641\/1167820\/10\/polisi-rilis-data-korban-tewas-9-orang-luka-53","https:\/\/www.webcitation.org\/5idH5lCIu?url=http:\/\/www.detiknews.com\/read\/2009\/07\/18\/235641\/1167820\/10\/polisi-rilis-data-korban-tewas-9-orang-luka-53","http:\/\/www.news.com.au\/heraldsun\/story\/0,21985,25795233-661,00.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20090720141047\/http:\/\/www.news.com.au\/heraldsun\/story\/0%2C21985%2C25795233-661%2C00.html","http:\/\/www.timesonline.co.uk\/tol\/news\/world\/asia\/article6717240.ece","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/07\/18\/world\/asia\/18indo.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/07\/17\/world\/asia\/17indo.html","http:\/\/in.reuters.com\/article\/worldNews\/idINIndia-41125920090717?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews","http:\/\/www.thejakartapost.com\/news\/2009\/07\/20\/1st-funeral-held-jakarta-bomb-victims.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20090726062945\/http:\/\/www.thejakartapost.com\/news\/2009\/07\/20\/1st-funeral-held-jakarta-bomb-victims.html","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/globalantiterror00ramr","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/globalantiterror00ramr\/page\/n308","http:\/\/www.cfr.org\/publication\/9361\/","https:\/\/www.webcitation.org\/5iccilBBM?url=http:\/\/www.cfr.org\/publication\/9361\/","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/07\/18\/world\/asia\/18indo.html","https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/worldnews\/asia\/indonesia\/5847847\/Indonesia-hotel-bombings-foreigners-among-nine-dead.html","http:\/\/www.mediaindonesia.com\/read\/2009\/07\/07\/85791\/37\/5\/Gegana_Temukan_1_Bom_lagi_yang_Siap_Meledak","http:\/\/megapolitan.kompas.com\/read\/xml\/2009\/07\/17\/11573026\/Ditemukan.Bom.Lain.di.JW.Marriott","http:\/\/www.theaustralian.news.com.au\/story\/0,25197,25795887-601,00.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20090720141004\/http:\/\/www.theaustralian.news.com.au\/story\/0,25197,25795887-601,00.html","https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB124783405799057621","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20090730211651\/http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB124783405799057621.html","https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB124800477158662841","https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB124844739830779241","https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB124818615231368559","http:\/\/www.smh.com.au\/national\/security-reassessment-20090718-dorv.html","http:\/\/www.stuff.co.nz\/world\/asia\/2603609\/Kiwi-killed-in-Jakarta-blasts","http:\/\/www.smh.com.au\/world\/hours-before-becoming-a-father-blast-that-destroyed-a-family-20090720-dqv4.html","http:\/\/megapolitan.kompas.com\/read\/xml\/2009\/07\/17\/11012018\/Inilah.Nama.16.WNA.Korban.Bom","http:\/\/www.canada.com\/news\/Canadian+burned+Indonesia+hotel+bomb+blasts\/1798323\/story.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20090718211951\/http:\/\/www.canada.com\/news\/Canadian+burned+Indonesia+hotel+bomb+blasts\/1798323\/story.html","http:\/\/www.straitstimes.com\/Breaking%2BNews\/SE%2BAsia\/Story\/STIStory_404411.html","https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/apps\/news?pid=20601087&sid=aslTMQuj6g4U","http:\/\/nasional.kompas.com\/read\/xml\/2009\/07\/17\/14331462\/presiden.kutuk.bom.mu.batal.ke.indonesia","http:\/\/www.gmanews.tv\/story\/167620\/RP-condemns-dastardly-inhumane-Jakarta-bombings","http:\/\/www.topnews.in\/oic-condemns-jakarta-bombings-2190270","http:\/\/www.unnindia.com\/english\/story.php?Id=4898","http:\/\/www.dw-world.de\/dw\/article\/0,,4495417,00.html?maca=en-en_nr-1893-xml-atom","http:\/\/www.thejakartapost.com\/news\/2009\/07\/17\/eu-australia-britain-condemn-jakarta-hotels-blasts.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20090719192504\/http:\/\/www.thejakartapost.com\/news\/2009\/07\/17\/eu-australia-britain-condemn-jakarta-hotels-blasts.html","http:\/\/www.ritzcarlton.com\/en\/Properties\/Jakarta\/Default.htm","https:\/\/www.google.com\/hostednews\/afp\/article\/ALeqM5gR2SOYGNnt5Jo_feMDvxwF-kGQcQ"]}
{"title":"2011 Minsk Metro bombing","article":"The 2011 Minsk Metro bombing occurred on 11 April 2011 when at least 15 people were killed and more than two hundred were injured in an explosion on the Minsk Metro, Belarus. The explosion happened at the central Kastry\u010dnickaja station at 17:55 local time.\n\nInitially the cause of the explosion was unclear, but was found to have been a bomb containing nails and ball bearings. President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko asserted that the explosion was aimed at undermining \"peace and stability\" and hinted at possible foreign involvement but also ordered an emergency investigation of domestic weapon storage facilities. The Prosecution Office launched a criminal investigation and classified the event as a terrorist attack.\n\nTwo suspects arrested on 13 April confessed to the bombing according to Belarus' deputy prosecutor general Andrei Shved. According to him they also pleaded guilty to Vitebsk cafe and Victory day bombings but the motives remain unclear. The investigation, which included law enforcement agencies from Russia, Israel and Interpol confirmed this view. Interpol stated that fingerprint evidence confirmed that the 2008 Victory day bombings and the 2011 Metro were committed by the same person.\nThe trials attracted international political condemnation and the verdicts passed out have been questioned, primarily by the Belarusian opposition and the EU. The bombing came at a time of economic problems and protests against Lukashenko's government. Natalia Koliada of the Belarus Free Theatre believes that the national intelligence agency of Belarus planted the device, rigged a show trial and tortured confessions out of the two suspects. According to the investigation, the bomb was unique and the foreign investigators also expressed great interest in it. In March 2012 both men (Kanavalau and Kavalyou) were executed by shooting.\n\n==Background==\nThe explosion in the Minsk metro led to the country's largest loss of life since 53 people were crushed to death at Nemiga in 1999. Previous bombings in the recent history of Belarus did not result in any fatalities. In September 2005, two bombings occurred in the northeastern city of Vitebsk. The former was blamed on criminal gangs, and the latter, in which 46 people were injured, was blamed on hooliganism.\n\nDuring the Belarus Independence Day celebrations on 4 July 2008, fifty people were injured when a bomb exploded at a concert in Minsk. Like the bombing at the Vitebsk cafe in 2005, the concert bombing in Minsk was blamed on hooliganism, and President Lukashenko stated that he didn't believe he was the target.\n\n==Incident==\n\n\n\n\n\nThe explosion happened at about 18:00 during rush hour at Kastry\u010dnickaja station, which provides the sole interchange between the two lines of the Minsk metro. Like nearly every station in Minsk, Kastry\u010dnickaja has an island platform, and during the explosion, trains were located on both tracks. According to the initial investigation, the bomb was located under a bench next to the inbound (Institut Kultury-bound) tracks. The bomb exploded next to the second car of an inbound train. At the moment of the explosion, there were 300 people in the area and an outbound (Uruchye-bound) train passed through the station without stopping. According to witnesses, there was \"a flash and a bang\" as passengers exited a train which had arrived at the station. The bomb was reported to have been packed with nails and ball-bearings, with an explosive force equivalent to 5\u00a0kg of TNT. It was said to be under a bench on the platform and could have been detonated by remote control. Interior Minister Anatoly Kuleshov said the perpetrators sought to \"kill as many people as possible.\"\n\nThe explosion caused a hole 80\u00a0cm in diameter. It was so powerful that it shook trains at the adjacent stations Pl. Lenina and Pl. Pobedy. The blast was equivalent to five to seven kilograms of TNT. According to Interfax, the bomb was partially composed of fragments of metal. The device was packed with ball bearings, indicating that it was a nail bomb; most of the injuries from the blast were caused by shrapnel. It is believed that the explosive device was radio-controlled and that the bomb was of advanced technical quality.\n\n===Victims===\nThe wounded victims were admitted to five hospitals in Minsk. Among the injured, 22 were in a serious condition, one of them died in the hospital. Another 30 suffered injuries of moderate severity.\n\n\nA national day of mourning was declared for 13 April 2011. Black ribbons were attached to flags, and all entertainment events cancelled.\n\n==Infrastructure==\nLike all metros built during the Soviet period, the Minsk Metro contains many artistic elements such as stylised lighting and decorative ceilings.  In his speech following the explosion, the president suggested that the design of Kastry\u010dnickaja station may have worsened the injuries. \"The metro should be decorated in a way so that nothing will fall onto people's heads,\" Lukashenko said. \"Not only from a blast.  People also received injuries from objects that fell from the ceiling.\"\n\nFollowing the attacks, Interior Ministry began installing metal detectors to all stations.\n\n==Investigation==\nPresident Lukashenko ordered a thorough investigation into the explosion. \"There should be results every day.  Work day and night,\" Lukashenko told the Belarus security apparatus. He urged Belarusian security officials to get in touch with Russian security to aid in the investigation due to their experience with terrorist attacks in Moscow Metro.\n\nThe president said \"We have been thrown a serious challenge. It requires an adequate response and it must be found. They will not let us have a peaceful life, I want to know - who\". He made an appeal to the Belarusian population to assist in the apprehension of the perpetrators: \"I would like to address the people honestly and openly: without you it will be difficult for us to find these monsters. You must help us.\" He also ordered the full transparency of the investigation and the full availability of information to the citizens.\n\nThe Belarusian State Security Committee announced that they would pay anyone who had photos or videos of the attack. The opposition newspaper Nasha Niva provided certain material.\n\nThree residents of Minsk were detained \"for spreading provocative rumors, sowing panic\". These people were alleged to be spreading false information about the new bombings on Internet forums and social networking sites.\n\nThe head of the investigation group, Deputy Prosecutor General of Belarus Andrei Shved, announced that several people were arrested on 12 April and the facial composite of the bomber was released. The head of the Belarusian State Security Committee Vadim Zaitsev said that three versions of the causes of the terrorist attack were being investigated: as a destabilisation attempt, the action of an extremist anarchist organisation and the action of an unhealthy person. Following the arrests, he said that the third version was now considered the correct one, that the attack was an act of an unhealthy person. Through cooperation with international investigators, it was confirmed that the perpetrator of the Metro attack was also linked to the Victory day bombings in 2008.\n\nLukashenko declared that they may have knowledge into who \"ordered the attack\". He also claimed they had admitted their guilt and described the investigation by the police and the Belarusian State Security Committee as a \"brilliant operation\". He claimed that they admitted they were also guilty for the Vitebsk cafe and Independence Day attacks. He also said their motives remain unclear. It was reported that psychiatrists interviewed the prime suspect and that he said that he \"enjoyed the suffering of others\" and did not claim any political motives. However, they considered him sane.\n\n==International reaction==\n\n;Supranational bodies\n* \u2014 Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said \"I do not know about the exact motives of what happened, but, as reported, it was the result of deliberate action. If so, then this is totally unacceptable and must be condemned. Whatever were the motives behind it, one can never justify the use of violent methods.\"\n**The Security Council issued a statement calling the incident an \"apparent\" terrorist attack. A diplomat from one of the 15 states on the Council said that: \"The word 'apparent' is included in this statement for a reason. There are credible indications in Belarus saying there is a more than even chance that the government was behind this.\" Another diplomat said: \"There was a lot of debate about this statement which is why it came out so late. But it just highlights international suspicions.\" The final statement read that \"The members of the Security Council condemned in the strongest terms the apparent terrorist attack that occurred in Minsk, Republic of Belarus, on April 11, 2011, causing numerous deaths and injuries. They expressed their deep sympathy and condolences to the victims of this heinous act and to their families, and to the people and government of the Republic of Belarus.\"\n* \u2014 High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton said \"I deeply regret the tragic loss of lives in the blast, which occurred yesterday.

{"title":"Aleppo University bombings","article":"The Aleppo University bombings took place on 15 January 2013, during the Syrian Civil War. The bombings killed at least 82 people at the Aleppo University, including students and children. The explosions reportedly struck an area between the University of Aleppo's halls of residence and the faculty of architecture, on the first day of exams. Both sides blamed each other for the explosions. While the university has been a center of antigovernment demonstrations, it is also in a government-held area, with neither side seemingly having had an obvious reason to strike. It was also a refuge for over 30,000 civilians fleeing the fighting in Aleppo.\n\nSyrian officials and media claimed rebels had launched two rockets at the campus from al-Lairamoun area, adding that similar rockets fired from there also hit the Bani Zaid area the same day. Aleppo's governor Mohammed Wahid Akkad called the rocket strikes a \"terrorist attack that targeted students on their first day of exams.\" Minister of Higher Education Mohammad Yahya Mu'ala said that President Bashar al-Assad gave his instructions to rehabilitate what has been destroyed in Aleppo University as soon as possible to ensure the process of the education and exams at the university, and rehabilitate all universities and institutions affected and damaged at the hands of \"terrorism which targets Syria and its people\".\n\nThe United States blamed airstrikes by government forces for the deaths, and condemned the \"despicable attack\". The opposition accounts claimed that warplanes had targeted the University in two separate missile attacks three minutes apart, they claim that it is backed by \"statements of eyewitnesses and video footage\". On 24 January, amateur video footage of a second explosion was released where the roar of over-flying jet, after missile hit, can be heard. Unnamed experts quoted by EA Worldview identified the missile as air-to-ground, as opposed to ballistic missile that Syrian government claimed to hit the university.\n\nCNN claims that most university students blamed the attack on the Syrian government, one student said that the explosions were more accidental. The student said that insurgent fighters just outside Aleppo who apparently were armed with a heat-seeking missile fired it at a MIG fighter, and that the pilot dropped a heat balloon as an evasive tactic, and that the missile followed the balloon and then exploded adjacent to the university dormitories. Other students also reported seeing what they described as heat balloons before the explosions. This does not however explain the second explosion.\n\nThe National Union of Syrian Students condemned the terrorist attack on Aleppo University. In a statement issued, the union stressed that the \"armed terrorist groups started to target universities after targeting the infrastructure of the national economy, the public and private institutions, factories, facilities, bakeries and the research centers\". The union expressed pride in \"the sacrifices of the Syrian Arab Army, wishing mercy upon the martyrs of Syria and the University of Aleppo\".\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/www.thenational.ae\/news\/world\/middle-east\/death-toll-rises-to-at-least-82-in-aleppo-university-bombings","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-21029034","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/01\/16\/world\/middleeast\/syria-violence.html?pagewanted=1&_r=2","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2013\/jan\/15\/aleppo-university-blasts-kill-52","https:\/\/syria360.wordpress.com\/2013\/01\/15\/sana-daily-headlines-january-15-2013\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150208170030\/https:\/\/syria360.wordpress.com\/2013\/01\/15\/sana-daily-headlines-january-15-2013\/","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/middle-east-live\/2013\/jan\/15\/150-killed-in-bloody-day-in-syria-live-updates","http:\/\/rt.com\/news\/aleppo-syria-blast-university-040\/","http:\/\/blogs.aljazeera.com\/topic\/syria\/us-blames-regime-airstrikes-aleppo-university-blasts","https:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/news\/world\/2013\/01\/16\/explosions-university-aleppo-syria-kills-many-people-including-many-students\/ZuQzN9aoXy9SIlnqOH8cMJ\/story.html","http:\/\/www.enduringamerica.com\/home\/2013\/1\/24\/syria-exclusive-definitive-evidence-of-regime-airstrikes-on.html","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/video\/2013\/jan\/23\/syria-aleppo-university-bombing-video","http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2013\/01\/17\/world\/meast\/syria-civil-war\/"]}

It killed 18 people and injured at least 44, 38 of whom were hospitalized. The attack occurred around 12:45 Moscow Time, close to metal detectors near the entrance of the station. The bomb contained the equivalent of  of TNT. Footage of the explosion was captured by two CCTV cameras inside the station and one outside.\n\nThe attack was initially thought to have been carried out by a female suicide bomber, sometimes known in Russian as a shahidka (\"Black Widow\"). Authorities identified the perpetrator as Oksana Aslanova. However, there was later uncertainty as to the identity of the bomber, with some news agencies stating the perpetrator was male. Some sources reported that the last name of the perpetrator was Pavlov. On 30 December it was reported that the perpetrator was an ethnic Russian convert to Islam from the city of Volzhsk, in the Mari El Republic, by the name of Pavel Pechenkin, who changed his name to Ar-Rusi after conversion to Islam. He was born to an ethnic Russian father, Nikolai, and a Muslim mother, Fanaziya, who both appealed to their son to abstain from violence and attempted to find him in Dagestan. On 7 January some newspapers reported that Pechenkin was cleared from the accusation of being involved with the bombing.\n\nIncreasing the confusion, some newspapers mistakenly reported Pechenkin as responsible for the 30 December Volgograd explosion (in the trolleybus). Experts suspect that Doku Umarov, an Islamist militant who has called for suicide terror attacks and has a history of supporting past attacks, was behind the attacks in Volgograd. Members of Vilayat Dagestan, part of Umarov's Caucasus Emirate took credit for the attack on 19 January.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered the most seriously injured to be flown to Moscow for specialist treatment.\n\n==Trolleybus bombing on 30 December==\nA second suicide attack took place on the morning of 30 December at about 8:30 Moscow Time in the Dzerzhinsky district in Volgograd. The bombing targeted a No. 1233 trolleybus of route 15A, which connects a suburb to Volgograd's downtown area, as it was passing one of the city's markets. From eyewitness photographs, it appears that the explosion took place in the back of the trolleybus. The attack killed 16 people and injured 41, 27 of whom were hospitalized. Remains of the male bomber were located and sent for genetic testing.\n\n\nFile:Trolleybus torn to pieces by the explosion in Volgograd.jpeg|Emergency response an hour after the explosion\nFile:2013 Volgograd Trolleybus bombing 02.png|Location of the trolleybus bombing\nFile:Volgograd trolleybus 2.jpg|ZiU-9 trolleybus vehicle\n\n\n==Responsibility==\nOn 19 January 2014, a statement and video claiming responsibility for the bombings was posted on the website of Vilayat Dagestan, a subgroup of the Caucasus Emirate. The video shows two Russian speaking men, identified as Suleiman and Abdurakhman, preparing explosives and strapping them to their bodies.\n\n==Reactions==\n\n===Russia===\n\n\nThe regional governor declared five days of mourning for the victims. The Ministry of Internal Affairs ordered general strengthened security at transportation facilities countrywide. Secretary of the Russian Security Council Nikolai Patrushev called a special meeting of the National Anti-Terrorism Committee to discuss the terrorist acts and possible countermeasures. Volunteers and Cossacks were mobilized to provide additional protection. The chief of the Volgograd Oblast's main Interior Ministry department assumed operational command of the Volgograd Interior Ministry Academy's staff and troops deployed in the town of Kalach.\n\nPeople laid flowers and lit candles near the building of Volgograd region representatives in Moscow to express their solidarity with the victims.\n\nA spokesman for the Investigative Committee stated that the explosives used in both explosions were identical and that the attacks were therefore linked.\n\nVladimir Putin flew to Volgograd on 1 January 2014, hours after delivering his customary televised New Year\u2019s speech; this had to be re-recorded so that he could mention the Volgograd bombings. Shortly after landing in Volgograd he delivered a speech at a meeting with senior regional and federal officials to discuss \"what is being done here and all across the country to maintain public security\" and said that \"the heinousness of the crime committed here in Volgograd needs no additional comments. No matter what motivates the criminals, there is no justification for the killing of civilians, especially women and children.\"  He vowed that his country would continue to battle terrorists until all are eliminated and that Russian forces would \"do their utmost to protect women and children during their operations\". After the meeting, he laid flowers at the site of the trolleybus attack and visited victims who were being treated in one of the city\u2019s hospitals.\n\nOn 1 January, the Orthodox icon called the Softener of Evil Hearts was flown around Volgograd on a helicopter. A prayer service for the victims was held in Kazan Cathedral.\n\n===International===\nNATO's general secretary Anders Fogh Rasmussen condemned the attack as \"barbarous\" and said that \"NATO and Russia stand together in the fight against terrorism, including by working together on technology to prevent attacks on public transport systems.\" The International Olympic Committee expressed sympathy for the victims and underlined that they trusted that Russia's security arrangements for the Olympic games would be adequate.\n\nThe Government of Chile issued a statement condemning \"in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks\", adding that \"the government and people of Chile deliver to the government and people of the Russian Federation and the families of the victims their deepest condolences and feelings of solidarity\".  The President of Israel said \"My heart goes out to those who have been affected by the heinous deed and by previous attacks which have afflicted Russia\", while the Prime Minister stated: \"I have no doubt that the citizens of Volgograd will continue to demonstrate the resilience, resolve and courage for which their city is renowned. Our thoughts and prayers are with you and the Russian people at this difficult time.\u201d The Government of Colombia, through its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, condemned the attacks perpetrated in Volgograd and expressed its condolences to the families of the victims. Colombia also stated that it \"considers the fight against terrorism a priority amongst all nations\" and that \"mutual cooperation is the most effective way to stop it\". The United States also condemned the bombings, saying that \"The United States stands in solidarity with the Russian people against terrorism\".\n\n== Investigation and trial ==\n\nAccording to the official investigation, the bombings were organized by a terrorist group called Kadarskaya based in Dagestan and led by Dzhamaltin Mirzayev. Other members involved in planning were Yusup Yakhyayev, Nasrulla Temirkhanov, Arsen Dadayev, Alautdin Dadayev and Ibragim Magomedov; the suicide bombers were Asker Samedov (train station bombing) and Suleyman Magomedov (trolleybus bombing). Two truck driver brothers, Magomednabi Bagirov and Tagir Bagirov, drove the bombers to Volgograd from Dagestan, hiding them in bales of hay. Bagirovs knew the people they were driving are involved with a terrorist cell, but were not aware of their ultimate bombing plans.\n\nMirzayev, Temirkhanov, Yakhyayev and Arsen Dadayev were killed by law enforcement on 5 February 2014 during a raid. Ibragim Magomedov was arrested during the same raid and testified against Alautdin Dadayev, who was arrested on 20 February 2014. Large quantities of weapons and explosive devices were found in Dadayev's house after his arrest.\n\nOn 5 December 2014, Alautdin Dadayev and Ibragim Magomedov were found guilty of participation in illegal armed formation and aiding terrorist activity (articles 208\/2 and 205.1\/3 of the Criminal Code of Russia) and sentenced to 19 years of imprisonment. Bagirov brothers were found guilty of aiding participants of illegal armed formations (articles 33\/5, 208\/2) and sentenced to 3 years 10 months of imprisonment each.\n\n== See also ==\n* 1977 Moscow bombings\n* February 2004 Moscow Metro bombing\n* 2009 Nevsky Express bombing\n* 2010 Moscow Metro bombings\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n\n*\n*\n*\n* RT News ticker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutin in Volgograd, 1 January 2014.\nCandles and flowers near the building of Volgograd region representatives in Moscow.","urls":["http:\/\/rt.com\/news\/russia-volgograd-trolley-blast-957\/","http:\/\/lenta.ru\/news\/2013\/12\/29\/explos\/","http:\/\/www.smh.com.au\/world\/female-suicide-bomber-attack-in-volgograd-russia-as-sochi-winter-olympics-approach-20131229-hv749.html","http:\/\/www.euronews.com\/2013\/12\/30\/cctv-footage-of-volgograd-train-station-suicide-explosion\/","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2013\/12\/29\/us-russia-blast-idUSBRE9BS02S20131229","http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2013\/12\/29\/world\/europe\/russia-train-station-explosion\/index.html?hpt=hp_t1","http:\/\/rt.com\/news\/volgograd-suicide-bombing-updates-940\/","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-europe-25541019","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2013\/dec\/29\/volgograd-train-station-suicide-bombing","http:\/\/www.kommersant.ru\/doc\/2379824","http:\/\/lenta.ru\/news\/2013\/12\/30\/pechenkin\/","http:\/\/www.interfax.ru\/russia\/txt\/349880","http:\/\/www.interfax.ru\/russia\/txt\/349516","http:\/\/www.themoscowtimes.com\/news\/article\/parents-of-volgograd-train-station-bomber-pleaded-for-his-return-video\/492336.html","http:\/\/pg12.ru\/news\/view\/63718","http:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/articles\/2013\/12\/30\/up-to-speed-4-things-to-know-about-the-russia-bombings.html","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2014\/01\/20\/us-russia-olympics-militants-idUSBREA0J0CX20140120","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-europe-25546477","http:\/\/world.time.com\/2014\/01\/19\/russian-islamic-video-threatens-sochi-olympics\/","https:\/\/archive.is\/20140120055546\/http:\/\/world.time.com\/2014\/01\/19\/russian-islamic-video-threatens-sochi-olympics\/","http:\/\/en.itar-tass.com\/russia\/713520","http:\/\/en.itar-tass.com\/russia\/713488","http:\/\/rusnovosti.ru\/news\/297962\/","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-europe-25551835","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2014\/jan\/01\/vladimir-putin-victims-volgograd-bombings-russia","http:\/\/en.ria.ru\/russia\/20140101\/186141934\/Putin-Discusses-Public-Security-in-Blast-Hit-Volgograd.html","http:\/\/altapress.ru\/story\/123949","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2013\/12\/29\/world\/europe\/russia-train-station-explosion\/","https:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=258035156","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20131231104335\/http:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=258035156","http:\/\/www.minrel.gob.cl\/gobierno-de-chile-condena-atentados-terroristas-en-rusia\/minrel\/2013-12-30\/153606.html","http:\/\/www.timesofisrael.com\/as-russia-grieves-pm-sends-condolences-to-putin\/","http:\/\/www.cancilleria.gov.co\/newsroom\/news\/comunicado-del-ministerio-relaciones-exteriores-rechazando-los-atentados-perpetrados","http:\/\/en.ria.ru\/sochi2014\/20131230\/186096308\/US-Slams-Volgograd-Terror-Attacks-Offers-Sochi-Help.html","http:\/\/www.bfm.ru\/news\/280659"]}
{"title":"2013 Sanaa attack","article":"The 2013 Sana'a attack occurred on 5 December 2013 when a series of bomb and mass shooting gun attacks killed at least 56 people and wounded 162 at the Yemeni Defense Ministry in Sana'a, Yemen. Yemeni military investigators say 12 militants, mostly Saudi nationals, were responsible for the attack \n\n==Attack==\nGunmen killed four guards surrounding the ministry compound. After the gate was open, a suicide bomber drove an explosive-laden car into the western entrance of the Defense Ministry complex. The suicide car bombing was followed by a coordinated attack by militants in another car. The gunmen entered the Al-Oradi Hospital inside the compound, shooting at those inside and killing many. At least six of the casualties were doctors and four were patients from a hospital within the complex. Another coordinated attack and gunfight outside the complex late afternoon was reported to have taken place.\n\n==Perpetrators==\nOn 5 December, Ansar al-Sharia, a militant group linked to al-Qaeda has claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\n==Victims==\nThe attacks claimed 56 lives and caused more than 200 injuries. Foreign medical workers were among the casualties. Among those who were killed were seven Filipino medical workers (including one doctor), two German aid workers, two Vietnamese doctors and one Indian nurse. Officials have said that all 12 militants which including Saudi Arabians were killed.\n\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nOn 6 December, the U.S. military has increased its regional alert status following deadly, coordinated strikes on Yemen\u2019s defense ministry that killed 57 and wounded 167 people on Thursday, a senior U.S. defense official said on Friday.\n\u201cThe United States military is fully prepared to support our Yemeni partners in the wake of this incident,\u201d the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity, and without offering further details.\n\nThe Philippines has banned deployment of migrant workers to Yemen in response to the attack which saw the deaths of seven Filipinos. The Philippine government will pay the expense of Filipinos who wish to return to the Philippines.\n\nGermany temporarily reduced its staff at its embassy in Sana'a and called for its aid workers in Yemen to leave the country \"as quickly as possible\",.\n\nAfter footage of the attack was aired on Yemeni television, showing an attack on a hospital within the ministry compound and the killing of medical personal and patients, the head of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula released a video message apologizing. Qassim al-Raimi claimed that the team of attackers were directed not to assault the hospital in the attack, but that one had gone ahead and done so.\n\n==See also==\n*Al-Qaeda insurgency in Yemen\n*2012 Sana'a bombing\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/web.utsandiego.com\/news\/2013\/Dec\/05\/al-qaida-claimed-attack-in-yemeni-capital-kills-52\/","https:\/\/archive.is\/20131211014026\/http:\/\/web.utsandiego.com\/news\/2013\/Dec\/05\/al-qaida-claimed-attack-in-yemeni-capital-kills-52\/","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-25228729","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2013\/12\/05\/world\/meast\/yemen-violence\/index.html","http:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/news\/world\/saudi-nationals-responsible-brazen-attack-yemen-article-1.1540093","http:\/\/www.yementimes.com\/en\/1736\/news\/3213\/Yemen-picks-up-the-pieces-after-attack-on-Defense-Ministry.htm","http:\/\/www.gmanetwork.com\/news\/story\/338485\/pinoyabroad\/news\/2-pinoy-doctors-among-25-reported-killed-in-latest-yemen-violence","http:\/\/english.alarabiya.net\/en\/News\/middle-east\/2013\/12\/06\/U-S-hikes-alert-after-attack-in-Yemen.html","http:\/\/www.arise.tv\/headline\/al-qaeda-linked-group-claims-responsibility-for-yemen-ministry-attack-4044","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20131209135944\/http:\/\/www.arise.tv\/headline\/al-qaeda-linked-group-claims-responsibility-for-yemen-ministry-attack-4044","http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2013\/12\/09\/philippines-workers-banned-yemen_n_4412039.html","http:\/\/www.mb.com.ph\/7-filipinos-dead-in-yemen-attack\/","http:\/\/www.aljazeerah.info\/News\/2013\/December\/4%20n\/20%20Yemenis%20Killed%20in%20an%20Attack%20on%20the%20Defense%20Ministry,%20December%205,%202013.htm","http:\/\/english.vietnamnet.vn\/fms\/society\/90895\/two-vietnamese-killed-in-yemen-terrorist-attack.html<\/ref>","http:\/\/en.alalam.ir\/news\/1541961","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2013\/12\/22\/world\/meast\/yemen-al-qaeda-apology\/"]}
{"title":"January 2014 Cairo bombings","article":"On 24 and 25 January 2014 a series of bombs exploded in Greater Cairo.

{"title":"2009 Karachi bombing","article":"The 2009 Karachi bombing or Ashura attack took place on 28 December 2009 inside a Shi'ite procession commemorating the day of Ashura, at Muhammad Ali Jinnah Road, Karachi. Ashura is the holiest of days for followers of Shia Islam and marks the anniversary of the death of Hussain, grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, who was killed at the battle of Karbala in 680. At least 30 people were initially reported to have been killed, later figures revealed even more deaths while dozens were left injured in the wake of the attack. The attacker marched amongst the procession with tens of thousands of people attending the march. There is some speculation amongst officials as to whether the nature of the blast was that of a suicide attack or a remotely detonated or planted bomb.\n\n==The attack ==\nOn 28 December, a bomb blasted the Shi'ite procession moving across a marked route on the Mohammad Ali Jinnah Road in Karachi, Pakistan's biggest city. Of tradition, the procession marked the death anniversary of the third Imam and the grandson of Muhammad. The bomber walked amongst the tens of thousands of Shi'ite followers and attacked from within the walking procession resulting in fatal injuries to 43 people.\n\nKarachi has been involved in sectarian violence in the past and as a result the Shia crowd turned hostile and immediately following the blast, turned their anger on the ambulance workers, security forces and journalists on site. Riots sparked throughout the city as mourners continued to stone ambulances and torch cars. Despite the City Government's appeal for a calmer reaction, the place of the original incident was set ablaze by the angry crowd. Around 3,000 shops in the neighbouring markets fell victim to the arson as people looted and then blazed the shops. Aggressive reactions resulted in the destruction of businesses incurring losses of up to a few billion rupees.\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn the wake of the attacks, Pakistani security forces were placed on high alert as Shia Muslims marked the holy month of Muharram. Thousands of police and paramilitary forces were deployed in the city for the fear of further terrorist attacks on the Ashura processions in others parts of the city and the nation. Emergency was declared in all hospitals located in Karachi following the explosion and arson incidents.\n\nThe arson was reported to have affected about 3,000 shops and the livelihoods of almost 10,000 people. Total loss incurred was Rs 30 billion in total. The markets that fell victim to the arson attacks included the Bolton, Light House, Paper, and Allahwala markets. Later reports speculated that the loss estimated exceeded to a staggering 4,000 shops and 40,000 effected families. Where eyewitnesses stated that the police and Rangers did not take action against the arsonists and robbers, some people talk of the arson as an elaborate conspiracy.\n\nFunerals for the victims were held on Tuesday, 29 December 2009 as most of city remained closed for business. Government offices remained closed before and after the funerals with an ongoing transport strike. Intermediate (Supplementary), B.Com. and other such examinations were postponed. The Prime Minister Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani provided in aid Rs 100 million ($1,470,913) towards the losses. On 30 December 2009, the city mourned the attack and observed a strike with shops closed throughout Karachi.\n\nOn 31 December 2009, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the bombing. It was reported that Asmatullah Shaheen, militant commander working with the TTP claimed responsibility for the bombings. His interactions were received on a telephone call with news agencies. Shaheen, a top ranking militant commander based in South Waziristan, is wanted by the Government of Pakistan and has a bounty of Rs 10 million ($147,091.30). Shaheen also iterated that the group would carry out more such attacks in 10 days from the 28 December attack.\n\nPakistani political and religions leaders called for strike on Friday, 1 January 2010.\n\n==Investigations==\nInvestigators in Karachi fell in doubt regarding the claims and called for experts from NWFP to determine the nature, design and make of the explosives used in the bombing. In the wake of the attack, Muttahida Qaumi Movement leaders called upon President Asif Ali Zardari to constitute an inquiry commission to investigate into the Ashura attack. Lack of forensic and ballistic expertise hampered the initial investigations and four days after the deadly incident, local police had yet not registered or recorded any statements from the survivors of the blast. The case relating to the bombing was registered as an FIR numbered 1439\/09 at the Preedy Police Station on behalf of the State under sections 302, 324, 435, 427 and 34 of Pakistan Penal Code, sections 3 and 4 of the Explosives Act and section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1997. On 3 Jan 2010 Dr Moeed Pirzada in his TV program Dunya Today exposed that Ashura Day Bomb Blast that killed 52 injured 100 injured was not a suicide bombing but a remote controlled device and that government was lying.\n\nOn 4 January, after this program was aired the investigating agencies admitted that the explosion was caused by a bomb planted along the way of the procession instead of a suicide bomber. The explosives were reportedly planted inside a box, near the Light House Signal, nuts and bolts were also recovered from the site of blast. Further investigation of the bodies revealed that they received cuts from pieces of steel from the box in which the bomb was placed. Another new source claimed that the mastermind of the Ashura blast was arrested 10 days before the attack by the police. The source also claims that police had managed to hide the arrest and the knowledge thereof. During interrogation, perpetrator Sirajullah using the alias Zeeshan, revealed all the details of the attack, including planning and details of the explosives to be used. The culprit is still in custody and under interrogation.\n\n==See also==\n* List of terrorist incidents in Pakistan since 2001\n* Hussain ibn Ali\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n*Karachi blast video  \n* , Al Jazeera English, 2009-12-28","urls":["http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/south_asia\/8432409.stm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20091229052251\/http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/south_asia\/8432409.stm","http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2009\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/12\/28\/pakistan.blasts\/index.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20091231063437\/http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2009\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/12\/28\/pakistan.blasts\/index.html","http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/wps\/wcm\/connect\/dawn-content-library\/dawn\/the-newspaper\/local\/16--police-yet-to-record-statements-of-ashura-blast-survivors-210-hs-03","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100103100814\/http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/wps\/wcm\/connect\/dawn-content-library\/dawn\/the-newspaper\/local\/16--police-yet-to-record-statements-of-ashura-blast-survivors-210-hs-03","http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/wps\/wcm\/connect\/dawn-content-library\/dawn\/the-newspaper\/front-page\/19-over-10,000-jobs,-rs30bn-lost-to-arson-029-hh-05","http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/wps\/wcm\/connect\/dawn-content-library\/dawn\/news\/pakistan\/metropolitan\/04-blast-in-karachi-qs-09","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20091231020033\/http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/wps\/wcm\/connect\/dawn-content-library\/dawn\/news\/pakistan\/metropolitan\/04-blast-in-karachi-qs-09","http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/wps\/wcm\/connect\/dawn-content-library\/dawn\/the-newspaper\/local\/karachi-demand-for-judicial-probe-into-blast,-arson-129","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/idUSTRE5BM15820091230","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100127224644\/https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/idUSTRE5BM15820091230","http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/wps\/wcm\/connect\/dawn-content-library\/dawn\/news\/pakistan\/04-ttp-karachi-blast-qs-07","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100102064023\/http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/wps\/wcm\/connect\/dawn-content-library\/dawn\/news\/pakistan\/04-ttp-karachi-blast-qs-07","http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/wps\/wcm\/connect\/dawn-content-library\/dawn\/news\/pakistan\/04-ttp-karachi-blast-qs-07","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100102064023\/http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/wps\/wcm\/connect\/dawn-content-library\/dawn\/news\/pakistan\/04-ttp-karachi-blast-qs-07","https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KgFDqJ9nezk","http:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/print1.asp?id=216939","http:\/\/www.nation.com.pk\/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online\/Regional\/Karachi\/31-Dec-2009\/Karachi-blast-mastermind-was-arrested-10-days-before-Ashura"]}
{"title":"2015 Bangkok bombing","article":"On 17 August 2015, a bombing took place inside the Erawan Shrine at the Ratchaprasong intersection in Pathum Wan District, Bangkok, Thailand, killing 20 people and injuring 125. Thai police were reported to have arrested two suspects, the second of whom confessed to having been the bomber. He later retracted his confession.\n\n==Prior incidents==\nPrior to this bombing incident, there were two other bombings in Thailand in the same year. In February 2015, two bombs exploded on the Siam BTS Station outside the nearby Siam Paragon shopping mall, injuring three people. The attack was believed to have been politically motivated. In April 2015, a car bomb exploded in Ko Samui, injuring seven.\n\n==Attack==\n\nOn 17 August 2015, at 18:55 ICT (11:55 UTC), a bomb exploded inside the grounds of the Erawan Shrine, near the busy Ratchaprasong Intersection in Bangkok's city centre. The Royal Thai Police said that  of TNT had been stuffed in a pipe and left under a bench near the outer rim of the grounds surrounding the shrine, and that an electronic circuit suspected to have been used in the attack was found  from the scene.  Surveillance footage showed a suspect leaving a backpack at the scene shortly before the explosion.\n\nNo one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. The attacks are thought to have targeted Thailand's tourism and economy, but there has been a range of inconsistencies in the statements of Thai authorities about those arrested and the reasons for the attack. The Thai government has at times suggested the bombers acted to avenge a crackdown on their human trafficking network, to take revenge for Thailand's deportation of a group of Uighurs back to China in July 2015, to strike a blow for the insurgents fighting the Thai government in the deep south, or for reasons related to Thailand's domestic politics. The government has implicated a range of other suspects in the bombing, mostly Thai opponents of the military regime.\n\nThe site of the bombing had been cleaned, and the crater paved over with cement, by 19 August.\n\n===Second incident===\n\nIn a separate attack in Bangkok, an explosive device was thrown from a bridge near a boat pier shortly after 13:30\u00a0ICT on 18 August 2015, but it caused no injuries. The device, possibly a grenade, appeared to have been thrown to the busy Sathon pier under the Taksin Bridge in Bangkok but landed in water of Chao Phraya river by the Saphan Taksin BTS station where it exploded. The district's deputy police chief said, \"If it did not fall in the water then it certainly would have caused injuries.\" Some damage was done to the bridge.\n\n==Victims==\n\n\n\n\nMost of the victims of the explosion were tourists visiting the shrine. The Royal Thai Police reported that 20 people died and 125 had been injured.\n\nThe dead included six Thais, five Malaysians, five mainland Chinese, two from Hong Kong (including one British national resident in Hong Kong), one Indonesian, and one Singaporean. In addition, citizens of Austria, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mali, the Maldives, Oman, the Philippines, Qatar, Singapore and Taiwan were among those injured.\n\nAll of the 14 non-Thai fatalities, from Malaysia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Singapore were ethnic Chinese.\n\n==Reward==\nPolice offered a one million baht reward for information leading to the arrest of the bomber. On 20 August this was increased to two million baht by an anonymous Thai businessman, and later to three million baht (US$84,000). A further two million baht (US$56,000) was offered by a prominent member of the Red Shirt movement and another two million by the son of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, as well as five million baht (US$140,000) for \"those officials who investigate and make arrests\". On 31 August, national police chief Somyot Poompanmoung awarded the three million baht to members of the police whose work led to the arrest of a suspect in the bombings. This suspect later confessed to being the individual seen on CCTV in the first bombing. One million baht came from police chief Somyot and the rest came from his friends. At the end of September 2015, police awarded themselves a second reward, essentially for making substantial progress in the investigation.\n\n==Investigation==\nInvestigators said they were \"certain\" that a man shown leaving a backpack at the scene of the explosion was responsible for the blast. The security camera footage, which has been broadcast internationally, shows the man in shorts and a yellow T-shirt taking off a dark-coloured backpack while sitting on a bench and then standing up, putting the backpack underneath the bench and walking away while looking at his phone. The suspect likely had arrived by tuk-tuk from an alley near Hua Lamphong.\n\nSome newspapers alleged that the man captured on security footage at the Erawan Shrine bomb attack was named by authorities as Mohamad Museyin, and that investigators are focusing their efforts on budget hotels in the Sathorn Road area of Bangkok where they believe the suspect stayed. However, this information was quickly dismissed by Thai authorities.\n\nThailand's chief of police said the attack was carried out by a network and released a sketch of the \"unidentified foreign man\" who was identified in CCTV footage as being the bomber. A warrant was issued for his arrest the same day the reward was announced. Police are also saying that two other people, wearing red and white T-shirts, seen in the same footage were being treated as suspects. These two suspected accomplices were later identified and cleared by police. Police said that the bombing was not international terrorism, but said that it involved several teams and at least 10 people. Military junta leader Prayut Chan-o-cha warned against speculating about the reason for the bombing too soon as, \"It could affect international affairs\".\n\nA taxi driver later confirmed that he picked up the suspect, and described him as \"not in a hurry. He seemed to be calm, like a regular customer, and not Thai. He also spoke in an unclear language on the way.\"\n\nVideo from shortly after the first bombing showed someone in a blue shirt kicking an item into the canal where the second explosion occurred the next day. On 27 August, an arrest warrant was issued for this unnamed individual.\n\nOn 29 August 2015, police arrested a 28-year-old man in connection to the bombing. He is not believed to have been the bomber but is suspected of involvement. His nationality was unknown but he had a fake Turkish passport, as well as at least 11 other Turkish passports and over 200 passports in all in his apartment, along with bomb-making components. The Turkish embassy in Bangkok denied that the bomb suspect arrested by Thai police and troops on Saturday is a citizen of Turkey. A second foreigner was detained near the Cambodian border on 1 September, and authorities planned to conduct DNA tests using DNA found on taxis the bomber used.\n\nOn 30 August, authorities raided an apartment building in Bangkok, initially telling reporters nothing suspicious had been found. However, on 31 August the authorities announced in a special broadcast that more bomb-making materials had been found and issued arrest warrants for 26-year-old Wanna Suansan, who is living in Turkey, and a foreign male named Jusuf. A photo of a suicide vest was displayed but authorities denied it was connected to the bombing.\n\nThe bombing is suspected to have been carried out by the Pan-Turkic Turkish ultra-nationalist organization Grey Wolves in retaliation for Thailand's deportation of Uyghur terrorist suspects back to China instead of allowing them to travel to Turkey for asylum. A Chinese ethnic Uighur man, Adem Karadag, was arrested by the Thai police in connection with the bombing after fake Turkish passports and bomb-making materials were found in his apartment.\n\nThe arrested suspect confessed to Thai authorities that he came from Turkey and travelled to Vietnam on a fake passport, and then travelled through Laos and Cambodia, paying bribes to Thai border police in Sa Kaeo to cross the border from Cambodia. He is believed to have provided Uyghurs with fake passports to go to Turkey.\n\nAdem Karadag, 31, was identified as the bomber on 26 September while being held in police custody, based on his own confession as well as other evidence.\n\nIn February 2016, Adem Karadag, also known as Bilal Mohammed, retracted his earlier confession that his lawyer said was a result of torture.\nHis co-defendant, Mieraili Yusufu, 26, also denied the charges. The Military Court has set April 20\u201322, 2016 for the inspection of evidence. As of 2018, it's estimated that it could take several more years for the trial of the suspects to be wrapped up.\n\n==Reactions==\nThai military junta leader Prayut Chan-o-cha called it the \"worst-ever attack\" on his country, saying, \"there have been minor bombs or just noise, but this time they aim for innocent lives. They want to destroy our economy, our tourism.\"\n\nThe foreign ministry announced that mostly Western countries issued travel warnings. Twelve countries\u2014Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United States\u2014issued \"Level 2\" advisories urging citizens to take extra care during trips to the country. Nine others\u2014Australia, Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Ireland, New Zealand, Russia, and the United Kingdom\u2014recommended a higher degree of caution, or \"Level 3\" warnings. Hong Kong advised its people to avoid non-essential travel to Thailand, or \"Level 4\" warning. The Netherlands instructed its people to be alert, or a \"Level 1 warning.\"\n\n==Effect on economy==\n\nMalaysia Airlines reported that there were no flight cancellations to Bangkok. After Hong Kong raised its travel advisory for Bangkok to \"red alert\", which prevented the purchase of compulsory travel insurance, the number of tourists from major Asian markets dropped by 10%. Hong Kong downgraded its travel advisory to amber on 22 September.\n\n==Notes==\n\n\n==References==\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents of Assumption College being evacuated shortly

{"title":"Boston Marathon bombing","article":"During the annual Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013, two homemade pressure cooker bombs detonated 14 seconds and  apart at 2:49p.m., near the finish line of the race, killing 3 people and injuring several hundred others, including 17 who lost limbs.\n\nThree days later, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released images of two suspects, who were later identified as Chechen Kyrgyzstani-American brothers Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. They killed an MIT policeman, kidnapped a man in his car, and had a shootout with the police in nearby Watertown, during which two officers were severely injured, one of whom died a year later. Tamerlan was shot several times, and his brother Dzhokhar ran him over while escaping in the stolen car; Tamerlan died soon after.\n\nAn unprecedented manhunt for Dzhokhar ensued on April 19, with thousands of law enforcement officers searching a 20-block area of Watertown; residents of Watertown and surrounding communities were asked to stay indoors, and the transportation system and most businesses and public places closed. Around 6:00p.m., a Watertown resident discovered Dzhokhar hiding in a boat in his backyard. He was shot and wounded by police before being taken into custody.\n\nDuring questioning, Dzhokhar said that he and his brother were motivated by extremist Islamist beliefs and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, that they were self-radicalized and unconnected to any outside terrorist groups, and that he was following his brother's lead. He said they learned to build explosive devices from the online magazine of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. He also said they had intended to travel to New York City to bomb Times Square. On April 8, 2015, he was convicted of 30 charges, including use of a weapon of mass destruction and malicious destruction of property resulting in death. Two months later, he was sentenced to death.\n\n\n== Bombing ==\n\n\n\nThe 117th annual Boston Marathon was run on Patriots' Day, April 15, 2013. At  , two bombs detonated about  apart at the finish line on Boylston Street near Copley Square. The first exploded outside Marathon Sports at 671\u2013673 Boylston Street at 2:49:43p.m. At the time of the first explosion, the race clock at the finish line showed 04:09:43the elapsed time since the Wave 3 start at 10:40a.m. The second bomb exploded at 2:49:57p.m., 14 seconds later and one block farther west at 755 Boylston Street. The explosions took place nearly three hours after the winning runner crossed the finish line, but with more than 5,700 runners yet to finish.\n\nWindows on adjacent buildings were blown out, but there was no structural damage. Runners continued to cross the line until 2:57p.m.\n\n== Casualties and initial response ==\nRescue workers and medical personnel, on hand as usual for the marathon, gave aid as additional police, fire, and medical units were dispatched, including from surrounding cities as well as private ambulances from all over the state. The explosions killed 3 civilians and injured an estimated 264 others, who were treated at 27 local hospitals. At least 14 people required amputations, with some suffering traumatic amputations as a direct result of the blasts.\n\nPolice, following emergency plans, diverted arriving runners to Boston Common and Kenmore Square. The nearby Lenox Hotel and other buildings were evacuated. Police closed a 15-block area around the blast site; this was reduced to a 12-block crime scene on April 16. Boston police commissioner Edward F. Davis recommended that people stay off the streets.\n\nDropped bags and packages, abandoned as their owners fled from the blasts,  increased uncertainty as to the possible presence of more bombs and many false reports were received. An unrelated electrical fire at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in nearby Dorchester was initially feared to be a bomb.\n\n\nThe airspace over Boston was restricted, and departures halted from Boston's Logan International Airport. Some local transit service was halted as well.\n\nThe Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency suggested people trying to contact those in the vicinity use text messaging instead of voice calls because of crowded cellphone lines. Cellphone service in Boston was congested but remained in operation, despite some local media reports stating that cell service was shut down to prevent cell phones from being used as detonators.\n\nThe American Red Cross helped concerned friends and family receive information about runners and casualties. The Boston Police Department also set up a helpline for people concerned about relatives or acquaintances to contact and a line for people to provide information. Google Person Finder activated their disaster service under Boston Marathon Explosions to log known information about missing people as a publicly viewable file.\n\nDue to the closure of several hotels near the blast zone, a number of visitors were left with nowhere to stay; many Boston-area residents opened their homes to them.\n\n== Investigation ==\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation led the investigation, assisted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, and they named two official suspects. It was initially believed by some that North Korea was behind the attack after escalating tensions and threats with the U.S.\n\nUnited States government officials stated that there had been no intelligence reports suggesting such an attack. Representative Peter King, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said: \"I received two top secret briefings last week on the current threat levels in the United States, and there was no evidence of this at all.\"\n\nAfter being identified, the father of the two suspects claimed that the FBI had been watching his family, and that they visited his sons' home in Cambridge, Massachusetts five times, most recently in 2011, as \"preventive work... afraid there might be some explosions on the streets of Boston.\"\n\n\nEvidence found near the blast sites included bits of metal, nails, ball bearings, black nylon pieces from a backpack, remains of an electronic circuit board, and wiring. A pressure cooker lid was found on a nearby rooftop. Both of the improvised explosive devices were pressure cooker bombs manufactured by the bombers. Authorities confirmed that the brothers used bomb-making instructions found in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's Inspire magazine. After the suspects were identified, The Boston Globe reported that Tamerlan purchased fireworks from a fireworks store in New Hampshire.\n\nOn April 19, the FBI, West New York Police Department, and Hudson County Sheriff's Department seized computer equipment from the apartment of the Tsarnaevs' sister in West New York, New Jersey. On April 24, investigators reported that they had reconstructed the bombs, and believed that they had been triggered by remote controls used for toy cars.\n\n\n== April 18\u201319 shootings and manhunt ==\n\n\n=== Release of suspect photos ===\nJeff Bauman was immediately adjacent to one of the bombs and lost both legs; he wrote while in the hospital: \"Bag, saw the guy, looked right at me\". He later gave a detailed description which enabled the photo to be identified and circulated quickly.\n\nAt 5:20p.m. on April 18, the FBI released images of two suspects carrying backpacks, asking the public's help in identifying them. The FBI said that they were doing this in part to limit harm to people wrongly identified by news reports and on social-media.\nAs seen on video, the suspects stayed to observe the chaos after the explosions, then walked away casually. The public sent authorities a deluge of photographs and videos, which were scrutinized by both authorities and online public social networks.\n\n=== MIT shooting and carjacking ===\n\nA few hours after the photos were released, the Tsarnaev brothers shot Sean A. Collier of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department six times in an attempt to steal his sidearm (Smith & Wesson M&P45), which they could not get out because of the holster's retention system. Collier, aged 27, was seated in his police car near the Building 32 on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus. He died soon after.\n\nThe brothers then carjacked a Mercedes-Benz M-Class SUV in the Allston-Brighton neighborhood of Boston. Tamerlan took the owner, Chinese national Dun \"Danny\" Meng, hostage and told him that he was responsible for the Boston bombing and for killing a police officer. Dzhokhar followed them in their green Honda Civic, later joining them in the Mercedes-Benz. Interrogation later revealed that the brothers \"decided spontaneously\" that they wanted to go to New York and bomb Times Square.\n\nThe Tsarnaev brothers forced Meng to use his ATM cards to obtain $800 in cash. They transferred objects to the Mercedes-Benz and one brother followed it in their Honda Civic, for which an all-points bulletin was issued. While the Tsarnaev brothers stopped at a Shell gas station, Meng escaped and ran across the street to the Mobil gas station, asking the clerk to call 911. His cell phone remained in the vehicle, allowing the police to focus their search on Watertown.\n\n\n\n=== Watertown shootout ===\nShortly after midnight on April 19, Watertown police officer Joseph Reynolds identified the brothers in the Honda Civic and the stolen SUV after overhearing radio traffic that the vehicle was \"pinged\" by Cambridge officers on Dexter Ave. in Watertown. Reynolds followed the vehicle while waiting for additional units to perform a high-risk traffic stop when the suspect vehicles both turned onto Laurel St. and stopped. A violent gunfight followed between the brothers, Officer Reynolds, Sergeant John MacLellan, and additional police responding to the \"shots fired\" radio transmissions from the two officers in the 100 block of Laurel St. An estimated 200 to 300 rounds of ammunition were fired; 56 of which were later determined to have been fired from the suspects, and at least one pressure cooker bomb and several \"crude grenades\" were thrown. The agencies involved in the nearly 7-minute long shootout included Watertown PD, Cambridge PD, Boston PD, Massachusetts State Police, Boston University PD, and MBTA Transit Police. The majority of the officers involved in the shootout were armed with the Glock 22 or Glock 23 .40 S&W pistol. The Massachusetts State Police troopers were armed with Smith & Wesson M&P45 pistols chambered in .45 ACP - leading to the 9mm casings and projectiles found at the scene to be matched to the suspects' 9mm Ruger.\n\nAccording to Watertown Police Chief Edward Deveau, the brothers had an \"arsenal of guns.\" Tamerlan ran out of ammunition and threw his empty Ruger P95 9mm pistol at Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese, who subsequently tackled him with help from Sergeant John MacLellan. Tamerlan's younger brother Dzhokhar then drove the stolen SUV toward Tamerlan and police who unsuccessfully tried to drag Tamerlan out of his path; the car ran over Tamerlan and  dragged him a short distance down the street, narrowly missing the Watertown officers. Dzhokhar abandoned the car half a mile away and fled on foot. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died at 1:35a.m. at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\n\nMassachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Police Officer Richard H. Donohue Jr. was also critically wounded by friendly fire from officers who shot at the fleeing vehicle, but survived. Boston Police Department officer Dennis Simmonds was injured by a hand grenade and died April 10, 2014. Fifteen other officers were also injured. A later report by Harvard Kennedy School's Program on Crisis Leadership concluded that lack of coordination among police agencies had put the public at excessive risk during the shootout.\n\nOnly one firearm was recovered at the scene, a Ruger P95 9mm pistol with a defaced serial number.\n\n=== Identification and search for suspects ===\n\n\nRecords on the Honda left at the scene identified the men as two brothers whose family had immigrated to the United States seeking political asylum around 2002: 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev and 19-year-old Dzhokhar \"Jahar\" Tsarnaev.  The FBI released additional photos of the two during the Watertown incident. Early on April 19, Watertown residents received automated calls asking them to stay indoors. That same morning Governor Patrick asked residents of Watertown and adjacent cities and towns to \"shelter in place\". Somerville residents also received automated calls instructing them to shelter in place.\n\nA 20-block area of Watertown was cordoned off and residents were told not to leave their homes or answer the door, as officers scoured the area in tactical gear. Helicopters circled the area and SWAT teams in armored vehicles moved through in formation, with officers going door to door. On the scene were the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Diplomatic Security Service, HSI-ICE, the National Guard, the Boston, Cambridge, Watertown Police departments, and the Massachusetts State Police. The show of force was the first major field test of the interagency task forces created in the wake of the September 11 attacks.\n\nThe entire public transit network and most Boston taxi services were suspended, as was Amtrak service to and from Boston. Logan International Airport remained open under heightened security. Universities, schools, many businesses, and other facilities were closed as thousands of law enforcement personnel participated in the door-to-door manhunt in Watertown, as well as following up other leads, including at the house that the brothers shared in Cambridge, where seven improvised explosive devices were found\n\nThe brothers' father spoke from his home in Makhachkala, Dagestan, encouraging his son to: \"Give up. Give up. You have a bright future ahead of you. Come home to Russia.\" He continued, \"If they killed him, then all hell would break loose.\" On television, Dzhokhar's uncle from Montgomery Village, Maryland, pleaded with him to turn himself in.\n\n\n\nDavid Henneberry, a Watertown resident outside the search area, noticed that the tarp was loose on his parked boat on the evening of April 19, two hours after the shelter-in-place order had been lifted. He then saw a body lying inside the boat in a pool of blood. Authorities surrounded the boat and a police helicopter verified movement through a thermal imaging device. The figure inside the boat started poking at the tarp, and police shot at the boat.\n\nAccording to Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis and Watertown Police Chief Deveau, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was shooting at police from inside the boat, \"exchanging fire for an hour\". A subsequent report indicated that the firing lasted for a shorter time. The suspect was found to have no weapon when he was captured. He was arrested at 8:42p.m. and taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where he was listed in critical condition with gunshot wounds to the head, neck, legs, and hand.\n\nInitial reports that the neck wound represented a suicide attempt were contradicted by his being unarmed. The situation was chaotic according to a police source quoted by The Washington Post, and the firing of weapons occurred during \"the fog of war\". A subsequent review by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts provided this more specific summary: \"One officer fired his weapon without appropriate authority in response to perceived movement in the boat, and surrounding officers followed suit in a round of 'contagious fire', assuming they were being fired on by the suspect. Weapons continued to be fired for several seconds until on scene supervisors ordered a ceasefire and regained control of the scene. The unauthorized shots created another dangerous crossfire situation\".\n\nThese confusions were caused in part by a lack of clearly identified and coordinated law enforcement command of the thousands of officers from surrounding communities who self-deployed into the Watertown area during events.\n\n== Legal proceedings ==\n\n=== Interrogation ===\nUnited States Senators Kelly Ayotte, Saxby Chambliss, Lindsey Graham, and John McCain, and Representative Peter T. King suggested that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a U.S. citizen, should be tried as an unlawful enemy combatant rather than as a criminal, potentially preventing him from obtaining legal counsel. Others said that doing so would be illegal, including prominent American legal scholar and lawyer Alan Dershowitz, and would jeopardize the prosecution. The government decided to try Dzhokhar in the federal criminal court system and not as an enemy combatant.\n\nDzhokhar was questioned for 16 hours by investigators but stopped communicating with them on the night of April 22 after Judge Marianne Bowler read him a Miranda warning. Dzhokhar had not previously been given a Miranda warning, as federal law enforcement officials invoked the warning's public safety exception. This raised doubts whether his statements during this investigation would be admissible as evidence and led to a debate surrounding Miranda rights.\n\n=== Charges and detention ===\n\nOn April 22, 2013, formal criminal charges were brought against Tsarnaev in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts during a bedside hearing while he was hospitalized. He was charged with use of a weapon of mass destruction and with malicious destruction of property resulting in death. Some of the charges carry potential sentences of life imprisonment or the death penalty. Tsarnaev was judged to be awake, mentally competent, and lucid, and he responded to most questions by nodding. The judge asked him whether he was able to afford an attorney and he said no; he was represented by the Federal Public Defender's office. On April 26, Dzhohkar Tsarnaev was moved from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to the Federal Medical Center at Fort Devens, about  from Boston. FMC Devens is a federal prison medical facility at a former Army base where he was held in solitary confinement at a segregated housing unit with 23-hour-per-day lockdown.\n\nOn July 10, 2013, Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty to 30 charges in his first public court appearance, including a murder charge for MIT police officer Sean Collier. He was back in court for a status hearing on September 23, and his lawyers requested more time to prepare their defense. On October 2, Tsarnaev's attorneys asked the court to lift the special administrative measures (SAMs) imposed by Attorney General Holder in August, saying that the measures had left Tsarnaev unduly isolated from communication with his family and lawyers, and that no evidence suggested that he posed a future threat.\n\n=== Trial and sentencing ===\n\n\nJury selection began on January 5, 2015 and was completed on March 3, with a jury consisting of eight men and ten women (including six alternates). The trial began on March 4 with Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb describing the bombing and painting Dzhokhar as \"a soldier in a holy war against Americans\" whose motive was \"reaching paradise\". He called the brothers equal participants.\n\nDefense attorney Judy Clarke admitted that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had placed the second bomb and was present at the murder of Sean Collier, the carjacking of Dun Meng, and the Watertown shootout, but she emphasized the influence that his older brother had on him, portraying him as a follower. Between March 4 and 30, prosecutors called more than 90 witnesses, including bombing survivors who described losing limbs in the attack, and the government rested its case on March 30. The defense rested as well on March 31, after calling four witnesses.\n\nTsarnaev was found guilty on all 30 counts on April 8.  The sentencing phase of the trial began April 21,\nand a further verdict was reached on May 15 recommending that he be put to death. Tsarnaev was sentenced to death on June 24, after apologizing to the victims. In 2018 Tsarnaev's lawyers appealed on the grounds that a lower-court judge's refusal to move the case to another city not traumatized by the bombings deprived him of a fair trial.\n\n== Motives and backgrounds of Tsarnaev brothers ==\n\n=== Motives ===\nAccording to FBI interrogators, Dzhokhar and his brother were motivated by Islamic beliefs but \"were not connected to any known terrorist groups\", instead learning to build explosive weapons from an online magazine published by al-Qaeda affiliates in Yemen. They further alleged that \"[Dzhokhar and] his brother considered suicide attacks and striking [the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular] on the Fourth of July; but ultimately decided to use pressure cooker bombs (capable of remote initiation, not detonation as the main charge was low explosives) and other IEDs.\" Fox News reported that the brothers \"chose the prestigious race as a 'target of opportunity' ... [after] the building of the bombs came together more quickly than expected\".\n\nDzhokhar said that he and his brother wanted to defend Islam from the U.S., accusing the U.S. of conducting the Iraq War and War in Afghanistan against Muslims. A CBS report revealed that Dzhokhar had scrawled a note with a marker on the interior wall of the boat where he was hiding; the note stated that the bombings were \"retribution for U.S. military action in Afghanistan and Iraq\", and called the Boston victims \"collateral damage\", \"in the same way innocent victims have been collateral damage in U.S. wars around the world.\" Photographs of the note were later used in the trial.\n\nSome political science and public policy writers suggest that Islam may have played a secondary role in the attacks. These writers theorize that the primary motives might have been sympathy towards the political aspirations in the Caucasus region and Tamerlan's inability to become fully integrated into American society. According to the Los Angeles Times, a law enforcement official said that Dzhokhar \"did not seem as bothered about America's role in the Muslim world\" as his brother Tamerlan had been. Dzhokhar identified Tamerlan as the \"driving force\" behind the bombing, and said that his brother had only recently recruited him to help.\n\nSome journalists and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's defense attorney have suggested that the FBI may have recruited or attempted to recruit Tamerlan Tsarnaev as an informant.\n\n=== Backgrounds ===\n\n\nTamerlan Tsarnaev was born in 1986 in the Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, North Caucasus. Dzhokhar was born in 1993 in Kazakhstan, although some reports say that his family claims that he was born in Dagestan. The family spent time in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and in Makhachkala, Dagestan.\nThey are half Chechen through their father Anzor, and half Avar through their mother Zubeidat. They never lived in Chechnya, yet the brothers identified themselves as Chechen.\n\nThe Tsarnaev family immigrated to the United States in 2002 where they applied for political asylum, settling in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Tamerlan Tsarnaev attended Bunker Hill Community College but dropped out to become a boxer. His goal was to gain a place on the U.S. Olympic boxing team, saying that, \"unless his native Chechnya becomes independent\", he would \"rather compete for the United States than for Russia\". He married U.S. citizen Katherine Russell on July 15, 2010 in the Masjid Al Quran Mosque. While initially quoted in a student magazine as saying, \"I don't have a single American friend. I don't understand them,\" a later FBI interview report documents Tamerlan stating it was a misquote, and that most of his friends were American.  He had a history of violence, including an arrest in July 2009 for assaulting his girlfriend.\n\nThe brothers were Muslim; Tamerlan's aunt stated that he had recently become a devout Muslim. Tamerlan became more devout and religious after 2009, and a YouTube channel in his name linked to Salafist and Islamist videos. The FBI was informed by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) in 2011 that he was a \"follower of radical Islam.\" In response, the FBI interviewed Tamerlan and his family and searched databases, but they did not find any evidence of \"terrorism activity, domestic or foreign.\" During the 2012 trip to Dagestan, Tamerlan was reportedly a frequent visitor at a mosque on Kotrova Street in Makhachkala, believed by the FSB to be linked with radical Islam. Some believe that \"they were motivated by their faith, apparently an anti-American, radical version of Islam\" acquired in the U.S., while others believe that the turn happened in Dagestan.\n\nAt the time of the bombing, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth with a major in marine biology. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen on September 11, 2012. Tamerlan's boxing coach reported to NBC that the young brother was greatly affected by Tamerlan and admired him.\n\nTamerlan was previously connected to the triple homicide in Waltham, Massachusetts, on the evening of September 11, 2011, but he was not a suspect at the time. Brendan Mess, Erik Weissman, and Raphael Teken were murdered in Mess's apartment. All had their throats slit from ear to ear with such great force that they were nearly decapitated. The local district attorney said that it appeared that the killer and the victims knew each other, and that the murders were not random. Tamerlan Tsarnaev had previously described murder victim Brendan Mess as his \"best friend.\" After the bombing and subsequent revelations of Tsarnaev's personal life, the Waltham murders case was reexamined in April 2013 with Tsarnaev as a new suspect. Both ABC and The New York Times have reported that there is strong evidence which implicates Tsarnaev in this triple homicide.\n\nSome analysts claim that the Tsarnaev's mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva is a radical extremist and supporter of jihad who influenced her sons' behavior. This prompted the Russian government to warn the U.S. government on two occasions about the family's behavior. Both Tamerlan and his mother were placed on a terrorism watch list about 18 months before the bombing took place.\n\n== Other arrests, detentions, and prosecutions ==\n\n=== People detained and released ===\nOn April 15, several people who were near the scene of the blast were taken into custody and questioned about the bombing, including a Saudi man whom police stopped as he was walking away from the explosion; they detained him when some of his responses made them uncomfortable. Law enforcement searched his residence in a Boston suburb, and the man was found to have no connection to the attack. An unnamed U.S. official said, \"he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time.\"\n\nOn the night of April 18, two men riding in a taxi in the vicinity of the shootout were arrested and released shortly thereafter when police determined that they were not involved in the Marathon attacks. Another man was arrested several blocks from the site of the shootout and was forced to strip naked by police who feared that he might have concealed explosives. He was released that evening after a brief investigation determined that he was an innocent bystander.\n\n=== Ibragim Todashev ===\n\nOn May 22, the FBI interrogated Ibragim Todashev in Orlando, Florida, who was a Chechen from Boston. During the interrogation, he was shot and killed by an FBI agent who claimed that Todashev attacked him. The New York Times quoted an unnamed law enforcement official as saying that Todashev had confessed to a triple homicide and had implicated Tsarnaev, as well. Todashev's father claimed his son is innocent and that federal investigators are biased against Chechens and made up their case against him.\n\n=== Dias Kadyrbayev, Azamat Tazhayakov, and Robel Phillipos ===\n\n==== Personal backgrounds ====\nRobel Phillipos (19) was a U.S. citizen of Ethiopian descent living in Cambridge who was arrested and faced with charges of knowingly making false statements to police. He graduated from high school in 2011 with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.\nDias Kadyrbayev (19) and Azamat Tazhayakov (20) were natives of Kazakhstan living in the U.S. They were Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's roommates in an off-campus housing complex in New Bedford, Massachusetts at which Tsarnaev had sometimes stayed.\n\nPhillipos, Kadyrbayev, Tazhayakov, and Tsarnaev entered the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth in the fall of 2011 and knew each other well. After seeing photos of Tsarnaev on television, the three men traveled to his dorm room where they retrieved a backpack and laptop belonging to Tsarnaev. The backpack was discarded, but police recovered it and its contents in a nearby New Bedford landfill on April 26. During interviews, the men initially denied visiting the dorm room but later admitted their actions.\n\n==== Arrests and legal proceedings ====\nKadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were arrested by police at the off-campus housing complex during the night of April 18\u201319. An unidentified girlfriend of one of the men was also arrested, but all three were soon released.\n\nKadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were re-arrested in New Bedford on April 20 and held on immigration-related violations. They appeared before a federal immigration judge on May 1 and were charged with overstaying their student visas. That same day, Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were charged criminally with:\n\n\n\nKadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were indicted by a federal grand jury on August 8, 2013 on charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice for helping Dzhokhar Tsarnaev dispose of a laptop computer, fireworks, and a backpack after the bombing. Each faced up to 25 years in prison and deportation if convicted. Tazhayakov was convicted of obstruction of justice and conspiracy on July 21, 2014.\n\nKadyrbayev pleaded guilty to obstruction charges on August 22, 2014, but sentencing was delayed pending the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Yates v. United States. Kadyrbayev was sentenced to six years in prison in June 2015. He was deported back to Kazakhstan in October 2018.\n\nTazhayakov pleaded not guilty and went to trial, arguing that \"Kadyrbayev was the mastermind behind destroying the evidence and that Tazhayakov only 'attempted obstruction.'\" Jurors returned a guilty verdict against him, however, and he was sentenced to 42 months in prison in June 2015, which equated to three and a half years. Judge Douglas Woodlock gave a lighter sentence to Tazahayakov than to Kadyrbayev, who was viewed as more culpable. Tazhayakov was released in May 2016 and subsequently deported.\n\nPhillipos was arrested and faced charges of knowingly making false statements to police. He was released on $100,000 bail and placed under house confinement with an ankle monitor. He was convicted on October 28, 2014, on two charges of lying about being in Tsarnaev's dorm room. He later acknowledged that he had been in the room while two friends removed a backpack containing potential evidence relating to the bombing.\n\nPhillipos faced a maximum sentence of eight years' imprisonment on each count. In June 2015, U.S. District Judge Douglas P. Woodlock sentenced him to three years in prison. Phillipos filed an appeal, but his sentence was upheld in court on February 28, 2017.\n\nPhillipos was released from prison in Philadelphia on February 26, 2018 and must serve a three year probation upon his release.\n\n=== Khairullozhon Matanov ===\nA federal indictment was unsealed against Khairullozhon Matanov on May 30, 2014, charging him with \"one count of destroying, altering, and falsifying records, documents, and tangible objects in a federal investigation, specifically information on his computer, and three counts of making materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements in a federal terrorism investigation.\" Matanov bought dinner for the two Tsarnaev brothers 40 minutes after the bombing.  After the Tsarnaev brothers' photos were released to the public, Matanov viewed the photos on the CNN and FBI websites before attempting to reach Dzhokhar, and then tried to give away his cell phone and delete hundreds of documents from his computer. Prosecutors said that Matanov attempted to mislead investigators about the nature of his relationship with the brothers and to conceal that he shared their philosophy of violence.\n\nMatanov was originally from Kyrgyzstan. He came to the U.S. in 2010 on a student visa, and later claimed asylum. He attended Quincy College for two years before dropping out to become a taxicab driver. He was living in Quincy, Massachusetts, at the time of his arrest, and was a friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev.\n\nIn March 2015, Matanov pleaded guilty to all four counts. In June 2015, he was sentenced to 30 months in prison.\n\n== Victims ==\n\n=== Deaths ===\nThree people were killed in the bombing. Krystle Marie Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager from Medford, Massachusetts, was killed by the first bomb. L\u00fc Lingzi, a 23-year-old Chinese national and Boston University statistics graduate student from Shenyang, Liaoning, and 8-year old Martin William Richard from the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, were killed by the second bomb.\n\nSean A. Collier, 27 years old, was ambushed by the bombers as he sat in his police car on April 18, at about 10:48p.m. He was an MIT police officer, and had been with the Somerville Auxiliary Police Department from 2006 to 2009. He died from multiple gunshot wounds.\n\nBoston Police Department officer Dennis Simmonds died on April 10, 2014 from hand-grenade injuries received during the Watertown shootout a year before.\n\n=== Injuries ===\nAccording to the Boston Public Health Commission, 264 civilians were treated at 27 local hospitals. Eleven days later, 29 remained hospitalized, one in critical condition. Many victims had lower leg injuries and shrapnel wounds, which indicated that the devices were low to the ground. At least 16 civilians lost limbs, at the scene or by surgical amputation, and three lost more than one limb.\n\nDoctors described removing \"ball-bearing type\" metallic beads a little larger than BBs and small carpenter-type nails about  long. Similar objects were found at the scene. The New York Times cited doctors as saying that the bombs mainly injured legs, ankles, and feet because they were low to the ground, instead of fatally injuring abdomens, chests, shoulders, and heads. Some victims had perforated eardrums.\n\nMBTA police officer Richard H. Donohue Jr. (33) was critically wounded during a firefight with the bombers just after midnight on April 19. He lost almost all of his blood, and his heart stopped for 45 minutes, during which time he was kept alive by cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The Boston Globe reported that Donohue may have been accidentally shot by a fellow officer.\n\nMarc Fucarile lost his right leg and received severe burns and shrapnel wounds. He was the last victim released from hospital care on July 24, 2013.\n\n== Reactions ==\nLaw enforcement, local and national politicians, and various heads of state reacted quickly to the bombing, generally condemning the act and expressing sympathies for the victims.\n\n=== Aid to victims ===\n\n\nThe One Fund Boston was established by Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and Boston mayor Thomas Menino to make monetary distributions to bombing victims. The Boston Strong concert at the TD Garden in Boston on May 30, 2013 benefitted the One Fund, which ultimately received more than $69.8 million in donations. A week after the bombing, crowd funding websites received more than 23,000 pledges promising more than $2 million for the victims, their families, and others affected by the bombing. The Israel Trauma Coalition for Response and Preparedness sent six psychologists and specialists from Israel to help Boston emergency responders, government administrators, and community people develop post-terrorist attack recovery strategies.\n\n=== Local ===\n\n\n\nNumerous sporting events, concerts, and other public entertainment were postponed or cancelled in the days following the bombing. The MBTA public transit system was under heavy National Guard and police presence and it was shut down a second time April 19 during the manhunt.\n\nIn the days after the bombing, makeshift memorials began to spring up along the cordoned-off area surrounding Boylston Street. The largest was located on Arlington Street, the easternmost edge of the barricades, starting with flowers, tokens, and T-shirts. In June, the Makeshift Memorial located in Copley Square was taken down and the memorial objects located there were moved to the archives in  West Roxbury for cleaning, fumigation, and archiving.\n\nFive years after the bombing, The Boston Globe reported all of the items from the memorials were being housed in a climate controlled environment, free of charge, by the storage company, Iron Mountain in Northborough, Massachusetts. Some of the items are also being stored in Boston's city archives in West Roxbury.\n\nBoston University established a scholarship in honor of L\u00fc Lingzi, a student who died in the bombing. University of Massachusetts Boston did the same in honor of alumna and bombing victim Krystle Campell. MIT also established a scholarship and erected a sculpture (unveiled on April 29, 2015), both in memory of MIT Police officer Sean Collier.\n\nOne study conducted by the Institute for Public Service at Suffolk University in Boston, Massachusetts, records the mental health and emotional response of various survivors, for three years following the bombing. In doing so, it reviews the kinds of aid that were available in local hospitals and gives advice as to how a person or community may be healed.\n\nThis study also mentions that after realizing the under coverage of people in the city being killed or injured on a daily basis, the city of Boston \"applied for and received a grant from The Rockefeller Foundation to be part of their 100 resilient cities network and to develop a cross cutting resilience strategy\".\n\nHowever, there was rising anti-Muslim sentiment online and locally in the weeks following the bombing, causing distress in the local Muslim community and leaving some afraid of going out.\n\nA monument memorializing the victims was completed at the bombing site on August 19, 2019.\n\n=== National ===\nPresident Barack Obama addressed the nation after the attack. He said that the perpetrators were still unknown, but that the government would \"get to the bottom of this\" and that those responsible \"will feel the full weight of justice\". He ordered flags to half-staff until April 20 on all federal buildings as \"a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated on April 15, 2013 in Boston, Massachusetts.\"\n\nMoments of silence were held at various events across the country, including at the openings of the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, and NYMEX on the day after the bombing. Numerous special events were held, including marathons and other runs.\n\n=== International ===\n\nThe bombing was denounced and condolences were offered by many international leaders as well as leading figures from international sport. Security measures were increased worldwide in the wake of the attack.\n\nIn China, users posted condolence messages on Weibo in response to the death of L\u00fc Lingzi. Chris Buckley of The New York Times said \"Ms. Lu's death gave a melancholy face to the attraction that America and its colleges exert over many young Chinese.\" Laurie Burkitt of The Wall Street Journal said \"Ms. Lu's death resonates with many in China\" due to the one-child policy.\n\nOrganizers of the London Marathon, which was held six days after the Boston bombing, reviewed security arrangements for their event. Hundreds of extra police officers were drafted in to provide a greater presence on the streets, and a record 700,000 spectators lined the streets. Runners in London observed a 30-second silence in respect for the victims of Boston shortly before the race began, and many runners wore black ribbons on their vests. Organizers also pledged to donate US$3 to a fund for Boston Marathon victims for every person who finished the race.\n\nOrganizers of the 2013 Vancouver Sun Run, which was held on April 21, 2013, donated $10 from every late entry for the race to help victims of the bombing at the Boston Marathon. Jamie Pitblado, vice-president of promotions for The Vancouver Sun and The Province, said the money would go to One Fund Boston, an official charity that collected donations for the victims and their families. Sun Run organizers raised anywhere from $25,000 to $40,000. There were over 48,000 participants, many dressed in blue and yellow (Boston colors) with others wearing Boston Red Sox caps.\n\nPetr Gandalovic, ambassador of the Czech Republic, released a statement after noticing much confusion on Facebook and Twitter between his nation and the Chechen Republic. \"The Czech Republic and Chechnya are two very different entities \u2013 the Czech Republic is a Central European country; Chechnya is a part of the Russian Federation.\"\n\nSecurity was also stepped up in Singapore in response to online threats made on attacking several locations in the city-state and the Singapore Marathon in December. Two suspects were investigated and one was eventually arrested for making false bomb threats.\n\n==== Russian reaction ====\nThe Russian government said special attention would be paid to security at upcoming international sports events in Russia, including the 2014 Winter Olympics. According to the Russian embassy in the U.S., President Vladimir Putin condemned the bombing as a \"barbaric crime\" and \"stressed that the Russian Federation will be ready, if necessary, to assist in the U.S. authorities' investigation.\" He urged closer cooperation of security services with Western partners but other Russian authorities and mass media blamed the U.S. authorities for negligence as they warned the U.S. of the Tsarnaevs. Moreover Russian authorities and mass media since the spring of 2014 blame the United States for politically motivated false information about the lack of response from Russian authorities after subsequent U.S. requests. As proof a letter from the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) was shown to the members of an official U.S. Congressional delegation to Moscow during their visit. This letter with information about Tsarnaev (including his biography details, connections and phone number) had been sent from the FSB to the FBI and CIA during March 2011.\n\nRepublican U.S. Senators Saxby Chambliss and Richard Burr reported that Russian authorities had separately asked both the FBI (at least twice: during March and November 2011) and the CIA (September 2011) to look carefully into Tamerlan Tsarnaev and provide more information about him back to Russia. Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) secretly recorded phone conversations between Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his mother (they vaguely and indirectly discussed jihad) and sent these to the FBI as evidence of possible extremist links within the family. However, while Russia offered US intelligence services warnings that Tsarnaev planned to link up with extremist groups abroad, an FBI investigation yielded no evidence to support those claims at the time. In addition, subsequent U.S. requests for additional information about Tsarnaev went unanswered by the Russians.\n\n==== Chechen reactions ====\nOn April 19, 2013, the press-secretary of the head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, issued a statement that, inter alia, read: \"The Boston bombing suspects have nothing to do with Chechnya\". On the same day, Kadyrov was reported by The Guardian to have written on Instagram:\n\nAny attempt to make a link between Chechnya and the Tsarnaevs, if they are guilty, is in vain. They grew up in the U.S., their views and beliefs were formed there. The roots of evil must be searched for in America. The whole world must battle with terrorism. We know this better than anyone. We wish recover  to all the victims and share Americans' feeling of sorrow.\n\nAkhmed Zakayev, head of the secular wing of the Chechen separatist movement, now in exile in London, condemned the bombing as \"terrorist\" and expressed condolences to the families of the victims. Zakayev denied that the bombers were in any way representative of the Chechen people, saying that \"the Chechen people never had and can not have any hostile feelings toward the United States and its citizens.\"\n\nThe Mujahideen of the Caucasus Emirate Province of Dagestan, the Caucasian Islamist organization in both Chechnya and Dagestan, denied any link to the bombing or the Tsarnaev brothers and stated that it was at war with Russia, not the United States. It also said that it had sworn off violence against civilians since 2012.\n\n=== Criticism of \"shelter-in-place\" directive and house-to-house searches ===\nDuring the manhunt for the perpetrators of the bombing, Governor Deval Patrick said \"we are asking people to shelter in place.\" The request was highly effective; most people stayed home, causing Boston, Watertown, and Cambridge to come to a virtual standstill. According to Time magazine, \"media described residents complying with a 'lockdown order,' but in reality the governor's security measure was a request.\" Scott Silliman, emeritus director of the Center on Law, Ethics and National Security at Duke Law School, said that the shelter-in-place request was voluntary.\n\nThe shelter-in-place directive was criticized by some commentators. Michael Cohen of The Observer said that Americans have little experience with daily terrorism compared to some countries and \"are more primed to \u2026 assume the absolute worst.\" Cohen wrote that it was not the first time dangerous murderers have been on the loose in a large American city (citing Christopher Dorner in 2013 and the Beltway sniper attacks in 2002), but noted that \"lockdown\" measures were not used in those cases.  Former congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul, criticized what he described as a \"military-style takeover of parts of Boston\" during the investigation and wrote that \"this unprecedented move should frighten us as much or more than the attack itself.\"\n\nHaaretzs Chemi Salev wrote that \"in terms of cost-benefit analysis, from the evil terrorist's point of view, the Boylston Street bombings and their aftermath can only be viewed as a resounding triumph\" since the \"relatively amateurish\" terrorists managed to intimidate a vast number of people and got a maximum amount of publicity. Responding to Salev in The New York Times, Ross Douthat commented that the massive manhunt operation might deter other amateur terrorists, but not hard-core terrorists such as Mohammed Atta. Douthat argued that out-of-the-ordinary measures can only be used when terrorism itself is out-of-the-ordinary: if attacks started to occur more often, people would not be as willing to comply with shelter-in-place commands, yet once a terrorist has been hunted with such an operation, it is hard to justify why such measures should not be taken the next time.\n\nThe National Lawyers Guild and some news outlets questioned the constitutionality of the door-to-door searches conducted by law enforcement officers looking for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.\n\n=== One Boston Day ===\n\nOn the second anniversary of the Boston Marathon Bombings, Mayor Marty Walsh established April 15, the day of the bombings, as an official and permanent holiday called \"One Boston Day\", dedicated to conducting random acts of kindness and helping others out. Over the past four years, some examples of acts of kindness being done have been donating blood to the American Red Cross, donating food to the Greater Boston Food Bank, opening free admission in places like the Museum of Science and Museum of Fine Arts, donating shoes to homeless shelters, and donating to military and veteran charities.\n\n== Conflicting reports ==\n\n\nOn the afternoon of the bombing, the New York Post reported that a suspect, a Saudi Arabian male, was under guard and being questioned at a Boston hospital. That evening, Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said that there had not been an arrest. The Post did not retract its story about the suspect, leading to widespread reports by CBS News, CNN, and other media that a Middle Eastern suspect was in custody. The day after the bombing, a majority of outlets were reporting that the Saudi was a witness, not a suspect.\n\nThe New York Post on its April 18 front page showed two men, and said they were being sought by the authorities. The two were not the ones being sought as suspects. They were a 17-year-old boy and his track coach. The boy, from Revere, Massachusetts, turned himself over to the police immediately and was cleared after a 20-minute interview in which they advised him to deactivate his Facebook account. New York Post editor Col Allan stated, \"We stand by our story. The image was emailed to law enforcement agencies yesterday afternoon seeking information about these men, as our story reported. We did not identify them as suspects.\" The two were implied to be possible suspects via crowdsourcing on the websites Reddit and 4chan.\n\nSeveral other people were mistakenly identified as suspects. Two of those wrongly identified as suspects on Reddit were a 17-year-old track star and Sunil Tripathi, a Brown University student missing since March. Tripathi was found dead on April 23 in the Providence River.\n\nOn April 17, the FBI released the following statement:\n\n\nThe decision to release the photos of the Tsarnaev brothers was made in part to limit damage done to those misidentified on the Internet and by the media, and to address concerns over maintaining control of the manhunt.\n\n== Film adaptation ==\nA film about the Boston Marathon bombing and subsequent manhunt, Patriots Day, was released in December 2016. Another film, Stronger, which chronicles survivor Jeff Bauman, was released in September 2017.\n\n== See also ==\n* 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt, attempted bombing in New York City using a pressure cooker bomb and other explosive devices\n* 2011 Waltham triple murder, a triple homicide to which Tamerlan Tsarnaev has been connected\n* 2013 Bat Yam bus bombing, bombing of a public bus in Israel using a pressure cooker bomb\n* Centennial Olympic Park bombing, a 1996 terrorist attack also targeting a public event\n* List of Islamist terrorist attacks\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\n* \n* \n\nCongressional hearings\n* \n* \n* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blasts (red) occurred along the marathon course (dark blue), the first nearer the finish line than the second.\nEmergency services at work after the bombing.\nThis pressure cooker fragment was part of one of the explosive devices.\nEmptied fireworks from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's backpack, found in a landfill near the UMass Dartmouth campus.\nScenes and approximate times of events of April 18\u201319.\nPost-capture celebrations in Boston's student-heavy Mission Hill neighborhood.\n thumb.\nAn apartment was searched in West New York, New Jersey that belonged to a sister of the Tsarnaevs.\nThe Prudential Tower lit up with a large \"1\" for the One Fund Boston a week after the bombing.\nVictims of the bombing are remembered at Copley Square in Boston.\nA monument memorializing the victims of the bombing was installed on Boylston Street, at the location of the explosions, in 2019..\nFlag flying at half staff at the American consulate in Milan, Italy.\nBoston Police Commissioner Edward F.

{"title":"Palm Sunday church bombings","article":"On Palm Sunday, 9 April 2017, twin suicide bombings took place at St. George's Church in the northern Egyptian city of Tanta on the Nile delta, and Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, the principal church in Alexandria, seat of the Coptic papacy. At least 45 people were reported killed and 126 injured. Amaq News Agency said the attacks were carried out by a security detachment of the ISIS.\n\n==Background==\nIn February 2017, ISIS called for attacks on Christians, and during the Sinai insurgency, hundreds of Christians fled their homes in the North Sinai after a \"concerted campaign of assassination and intimidation\". The bombings occurred under President (and former general) Abdel Fattah el-Sisi who has emphasized national security during his rule, and who recently returned from a trip to the United States to visit President Donald Trump, a trip widely regarded as successful and as a confirmation of the US administration's support for Sisi's fight against ISIS.\n\n==Bombing==\n\nOn Palm Sunday, 9 April 2017, an explosive device was detonated inside St. George's Church in the Nile Delta city of Tanta. According to eyewitnesses, as they were attending the Divine Liturgy,  a man in a brown jacket rapidly charged toward the altar before detonating an explosive belt. This man, Mahmoud Mohamed Ali Hussein, is believed to have been in charge of both church bombings in Tanta and Alexandria. Video footage showed people assembled at the church, chanting the liturgy. The video rapidly changed to bars, as screams of terror and crying were heard in the background. A preliminary report by the prosecution determined that the bomb contained TNT, as well as large amounts of metallic screws and highly flammable substances.\n\nLater at Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Alexandria, historical seat of the Coptic papacy, another device exploded near the cathedral's gates. The incident occurred minutes after Pope Tawadros II left the church to follow the developments of the Tanta bombing. The pope escaped unharmed. Conflicting reports emerged over the identity of the perpetrator. Egyptian television published a photo of a man who was stopped and interrogated near the entrance. The suspect reportedly detonated a suicide belt when members of the security force, assigned to this church, tried to arrest him. Other camera footage, however, showed a different man trying to pass through the metal detectors at the entrance, a few seconds before the bomb went off.\n\n==Casualties==\nThe bombing in Alexandria killed 17 people and injured 48. In Tanta, 30 people were killed and 78 injured.\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn Tanta, security forces sealed off all the streets leading to the church and set up emergency checkpoints, allowing bomb disposal experts to examine the church and cars parked in its surroundings for any remaining explosives. Egypt's interior minister, Magdy Abdel Ghaffar, Prosecutor-General, Nabil Sadek, and other government officials arrived at the scene shortly after the bombing. Forensic experts identified an unknown severed head as a possible suspect in the attack. Tanta's residents, who were demonstrating nearby, physically assaulted Major General Hossam el-Din Khalifa, head of the Gharbia's Security Directorate. Khalifa, along with other heads of security, were dismissed later that day by Abdel Ghaffar.\n\nThree other explosive devices were dismantled by police. Two of them were left by an unknown individual in front of Sidi Abdel Rahim Mosque in Tanta, which contains a Sufi shrine. The other was in Alexandria's Coll\u00e8ge Saint Marc.\n\n===State of emergency===\nOn the same day, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi announced that a three-month state of emergency would be imposed. The attack was seen as underscoring the failure of Egypt's intelligence agencies to \"anticipate a coordinated wave of attacks\" and the difficulty of stopping suicide attacks, despite the \"largely unfettered powers\" of the President el-Sisi and his imprisonment and exiling of \"thousands of political opponents\".\n\nThe three-month state of emergency must be approved by the Parliament of Egypt. Following its approval, President El-Sisi will have the authority to increase the powers of the police in arrests, surveillance, and seizures.\n\n==Responsibility==\nAn online statement via the Amaq News Agency said, \"A security detachment of the Islamic State carried out the attacks against the two churches in the cities of Tanta and Alexandria\". The two Egyptian suicide bombers were named Abu Ishaq Al-Masri and Abu Al-Baraa Al-Masri.\n\nThe group previously said the Islamic State was responsible for the December 2016 Botroseya Church bombing at St. Peter and St. Paul's Church in Cairo, which killed 29 people and injured 47 others.\n\n===Identification===\nOn 12 April 2017, Egyptian Interior Ministry identified Mahmud Hassan Mubarak Abdullah from the Arab Al Ashraf tribe, born in 1986 in Qena Governorate, as the bomber who had carried out the attack outside Saint Mark's church in Alexandria by comparing the DNA of remains found at the site of the bombing with the DNA of runaway suspects. A day later, Egyptian authorities identified the second bomber as Mamduh Amin Mohammed Baghdadi also from Al Ashraf tribe, born in 1977 in Qena Governorate.\n\n== Reactions ==\n=== Domestic ===\nThe Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi summoned the national security council, and said that those wounded could receive medical care at military hospitals. The following day, president el-Sisi declared a three-month state of emergency across the country.\n\nThe Egyptian Council of Churches, through its secretary-general, priest Rifaat Fathy, expressed its condolences to the victims' relatives and to Pope Tawadros II, and announced its support to Sisi's swift response to the events and to the counter-terrorism efforts of the country's security apparatus.\n\nThe head of Al-Azhar, Egypt's leading center for the study of Sunni Islam, Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, denounced the deadly attacks, calling them a \"despicable terrorist bombing that targeted the lives of innocents.\" Following the attacks, Muslims gathering inside mosques to donate blood for victims. Egyptians also showed solidarity with the victims by using a hashtag on social media that translates to \"your terrorism brings us together.\"\n\n=== International ===\nThe governments of Armenia, Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, Cyprus, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Lebanon, Malaysia, Morocco, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United States condemned the attacks, as did the United Nations Security Council and United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres.\n\nThe Holy See received news of the attacks while Pope Francis was holding the Palm Sunday mass in front of thousands in St. Peter's Square. The Roman Catholic pope, who is due to visit Egypt on 28 April, offered his condolences to his \"brother\" Tawadros II and to \"all of the dear Egyptian nation\" during his speech, while praying for the dead and the wounded. The World Council of Churches and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, also spoke out against the attacks. Despite the recent events the Pope's visit to Egypt will proceed as planned.\n\nSaudi Arabia's highest religious body, the Council of Senior Scholars (also known as the Senior Council of Ulema)\u00a0condemned the twin Egypt church attacks, saying the bombings represented a \"criminal act considered forbidden by Islamic consensus...these bombings have violated several tenants of Islam; from treachery to sin and aggression.\"\n\nThe International Muslim Brotherhood condemned the attack as \"painfully tragic\" and that \"the blood of the innocent will be a curse on the oppressors\" whilst stating blame was due to the government who came to power after the 2013 coup in Egypt.\n\nUS President Donald Trump condemned the attacks via social media; he said on his Twitter account: \"So sad to hear of the terrorist attack in Egypt. U.S. strongly condemns.\"\n\nAfter the attacks, Israel closed the Taba Border Crossing with Egypt.\n\n==See also==\n* 2017 Minya attack\n* Kosheh massacres\n* Nag Hammadi massacre\n* 2011 Alexandria

{"title":"2011 Norway attacks","article":"The 2011 Norway attacks, referred to in Norway as 22 July or as 22\/7, were two sequential lone wolf domestic terrorist\nattacks by Anders Behring Breivik against the government, the civilian population, and a Workers' Youth League (AUF) summer camp, in which 77 people were killed.\n\nThe first attack was a car bomb explosion in Oslo within Regjeringskvartalet, the executive government quarter of Norway, at 15:25:22 (CEST). The bomb was placed inside a van next to the tower block housing the office of the then Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg. The explosion killed eight people and injured at least 209 people, twelve severely.\n\nThe second attack occurred less than two hours later at a summer camp on the island of Ut\u00f8ya in Tyrifjorden, Viken. The camp was organized by the AUF, the youth division of the ruling Norwegian Labour Party (AP). Breivik, dressed in a homemade police uniform and showing false identification, took a ferry to the island and opened fire at the participants, killing 69 and injuring at least 110, 55 seriously. Among the dead were Stoltenberg's friends, and the stepbrother of Norway's crown princess Mette-Marit.\n\nThe attack was the deadliest in Norway since World War II and the shooting at Ut\u00f8ya remains the deadliest mass shooting by a lone perpetrator in history. A survey found that one in four Norwegians knew someone affected. The European Union, NATO and several countries expressed their support for Norway and condemned the attacks. The 2012 Gj\u00f8rv Report concluded that Norway's police could have prevented the bombing and caught Breivik faster at Ut\u00f8ya, and that measures to prevent further attacks and \"mitigate adverse effects\" should have been implemented.\n\nThe Norwegian Police arrested Anders Behring Breivik, a 32-year-old Norwegian right-wing extremist, on Ut\u00f8ya island and charged him with both attacks. His trial took place between 16 April and 22 June 2012 in Oslo District Court, where Breivik admitted carrying out the attacks, but denied criminal guilt and claimed the defense of necessity. On 24 August, Breivik was convicted as charged and sentenced to 21 years of preventive detention in prison, the maximum sentence allowed in Norway. The sentence can be extended indefinitely as long as the prisoner is deemed a threat to society.\n\n==Preparation for the attacks==\n\nBreivik claims to have begun the planning of the terrorist acts in 2002, at the age of 23. He had participated for years in debates on Internet forums and spoken against Islam and immigration. He was preparing for the attacks from at least as early as 2009, though he concealed his violent intentions.\n\n===Failed attempt to buy weapons in Prague===\n\nBreivik spent six days in Prague in late August and early September 2010. Following his Internet inquiry, Breivik noted that \"Prague is known for maybe being the most important transit site point for illicit drugs and weapons in Europe\". Despite the fact that Prague has one of the lowest crime rates among European capitals, Breivik expressed reservations about his personal safety, writing that (before his trip there) he believed Prague to be a dangerous place with \"many brutal and cynical criminals\".\n\nHe hollowed out the rear seats of his Hyundai Atos in order to have enough space for the firearms he hoped to buy. After two days, he got a prospectus for a mineral extraction business printed, which was supposed to give him an alibi in case someone suspected him of preparing a terrorist attack. He wanted to buy an AK-47-type rifle (this firearm is not common in the country, unlike the Vz. 58,), a Glock pistol, hand-grenades and a rocket-propelled grenade, stating that getting the latter two would be a \"bonus\".\n\nBreivik had several fake police badges printed to wear with a police uniform, which he had acquired illegally on the Internet, and which he later wore during the attack. Contrary to his expectations, he was unable to get any firearms in the Czech Republic, commenting that it was the \"first major setback in [his] operation\". In the end, he concluded that Prague was \"far from an ideal city to buy guns\", nothing like \"what the BBC reported\", and that he had felt \"safer in Prague than in Oslo\".\n\n===Arming in Norway and through the Internet===\n\nOriginally, Breivik intended to try to obtain weapons in Germany or Serbia if his mission in Prague failed. The Czech disappointment led him to procure his weapons through legal channels. He decided to obtain a semi-automatic rifle and a Glock pistol legally in Norway, noting that he had a \"clean criminal record, hunting license, and two guns (a Benelli Nova 12 gauge pump-action shotgun and a .308 bolt-action rifle) already for seven years\", and that obtaining the guns legally should therefore not be a problem.\n\n\nUpon returning to Norway, Breivik obtained a legal permit for a .223-caliber Ruger Mini-14 semi-automatic carbine, ostensibly for the purpose of hunting deer. He bought it in late 2010 for \u20ac1,400. He wanted to purchase a 7.62\u00d739mm Ruger Mini-30 semi-automatic carbine, but decided for unknown reasons to buy the Mini-14.\n\nGetting a permit for the pistol proved more difficult, as he had to demonstrate regular attendance at a sport shooting club. He also bought ten 30-round magazines for the rifle from a United States supplier, and six magazines for the pistol (including four 30-round magazines) in Norway. From November 2010 to January 2011 he went through 15 training sessions at the Oslo Pistol Club, and by mid-January his application to purchase a Glock pistol was approved.\n\nBreivik claimed in his manifesto that he bought 300 g of sodium nitrate from a Polish shop for . The Polish ABW interviewed the company owner on 24 July 2011. Breivik's Polish purchases initially led to his being placed on the watch list of the Norwegian intelligence, which did not act because they did not believe his actions were relevant to their terror concerns.\n\nHe had also planned a last religious service (in Frogner Church, Oslo) before the attack.\n\n====Breivik Geofarm====\nOn 18 May 2009 Behring Breivik created a sole proprietorship called Breivik Geofarm, a company established under the fictitious purpose of cultivating vegetables, melons, roots and tubers. The real purpose was to gain access to chemicals and materials, especially fertiliser that could be used for the production of explosives without arousing suspicion.\n\nThe place of business was given as \u00c5mot in Hedmark. On 4 May 2011, Breivik purchased  of fertilizer through Geofarm at Felleskj\u00f8pet,  of ammonium nitrate and  of calcium ammonium nitrate. According to neighbours, all the fertiliser was stored in his barn. After conducting a reconstruction of the bomb with equivalent amount of fertilizer on the farm in \u00c5mot, police and bomb experts concluded that the bomb had been , about the same size as the one used in the 2002 Bali bombings. Afterwards there was significant debate in Norway about how an amateur could acquire such substantial amounts of fertiliser and manufacture and place such a lethal weapon in the middle of Regjeringskvartalet all by himself. The conclusion by Felleskj\u00f8pet was that there is no legislation to keep agricultural businesses from buying as much fertiliser as they like, and that there was nothing suspicious about Breivik's purchase. This was confirmed by the director of the Norwegian Police Security Service, Janne Kristiansen, who stated \"not even the Stasi could have prevented this attack\".\n\nThe company listed at least two Swedish employees on the social networking site Facebook, but it is uncertain whether these people existed.\n\nIn April 2011 he reported moving from Oslo to V\u00e5lstua farm in the municipality of \u00c5mot, about  south of the community centre Rena, on the east side of Glomma. His agricultural company was run from the farm, and gave him access to ingredients for explosives.\n\nHis  car bomb exploded in central Oslo on 22 July 2011 where it killed eight people. He had between  of additional material that was left on the farm and could be used for construction of a second bomb.\n\n===Weapons training===\nBeside visiting firing ranges and countries with relaxed gun laws to sharpen his skill, Breivik's manifesto says that he made use of the video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 as a training aid while using World of Warcraft as a cover for his extended period of isolation. He also said that he honed his shooting skills using an in-game holographic sight similar to the one he used during the attacks.\n\n==Oslo bombing==\n\n\nOn 22 July 2011 at 15:25:22 (CEST) a bomb detonated in Regjeringskvartalet, central Oslo. The bomb was placed in a white Volkswagen Crafter and parked in front of the H block, housing the Office of the Prime Minister, Ministry of Justice and the Police, and several other governmental buildings, such as the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (R4), Ministry of Finance (G block), Ministry of Education and Research (Y block) and the Supreme Court of Norway (behind the G block).\n\nThe Crafter was registered by surveillance cameras as entering Grubbegata from Grensen at 15:13:23. The van stopped at 15:13:43,  before the H block. It stood still with the hazard warning lamps on for 1 minute and 54 seconds. The driver then drove the last 200 metres and parked the van in front of the main entrance of the main government building. The van was parked at 15:16:30. The front door of the van opened 16 seconds later and after another 16 seconds the driver stepped out of the van. He stood outside the van for 7 seconds before quickly walking away towards Hammersborg torg, where he had another car parked.\n\nThe driver was dressed like a police officer and had a gun in his hand. A police helmet with a face shield was covering his face. Breivik was not positively identified.\n\nThe explosion started fires in the H block and R4, and the shock wave blew out the windows on all floors as well as in the VG house and other buildings on the other side of the square. The streets in the area were filled with glass and debris. A cloud of white smoke was reported as a fire continued to burn at the Department of Oil and Energy. The blast was heard at least  away.\n\nAt 15:26 the police received the first message about the explosion, and at 15:28 the first police patrol reported arriving at the scene. At the same time, news agency NTB was told that the Prime Minister was unhurt and safe.\n\nA witness called police at 15:34 to report a person in a police uniform holding a pistol in his hand, entering an unmarked vehicle, a Fiat Dobl\u00f2. Information\u2014including the vehicle's license plate number and description of the suspect\u2014was written on a yellow note, and hand delivered to the police operations central where it lay for twenty minutes before the witness was phoned back. The license plate number was not transmitted on the police radio until two hours later.\n\nFollowing the explosion, police cleared the area and searched for any additional explosive devices. Through media outlets, police urged citizens to evacuate central Oslo.\n\nPolice later announced that the bomb was composed of a mixture of fertilizer and fuel oil (ANFO), similar to that used in the Oklahoma City bombing.\nThe blast was caught on many security cameras.\n\n===Impact on transportation===\n\nImmediately after the explosion, the area surrounding the damaged buildings was cordoned off and evacuated. People were asked to remain calm and leave the city centre if possible, but there was no general evacuation. The Oslo Metro remained operational, and most of the Oslo tram network was also running, although sporadically, except for the line through Grensen (the street between Prof. Aschehoug's plass and Stortorvet). Buses also continued to run, although at least one articulated bus on the No.37 line, which stops outside the Ministry of Finance, was commandeered to evacuate the walking wounded.\n\nAn e-mail communication with the BBC from a traveller indicated that police were conducting searches in suspicious cars on the road to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which remained open.\n\nThe Gardermoen Line between Lillestr\u00f8m and Oslo Airport was shut down after a suspicious package was found close to the tracks. The same happened at the offices of TV 2 which were evacuated after a suspicious package was found outside the building.\n\n==Ut\u00f8ya massacre ==\n\n\n===Attack===\nApproximately one and a half hours after the Oslo explosion, Breivik, dressed in a police uniform and presenting himself as \"Martin Nilsen\" from the Oslo Police Department, boarded the ferry  at Ut\u00f8ykaia in Tyrifjorden, a lake some  northwest of Oslo, to the island of Ut\u00f8ya, the location of the Norwegian Labour Party's AUF youth camp. The camp is held there every summer and was attended by approximately 600 teenagers.\n\nWhen Breivik arrived on the island, he presented himself as a police officer who had come over for a routine check following the bombing in Oslo. He was met by Monica B\u00f8sei, the camp leader and island hostess. B\u00f8sei probably became suspicious and contacted Trond Berntsen, the security officer on the island, before Breivik killed them both. He then signalled and asked people to gather around him before pulling weapons and ammunition from a bag and firing indiscriminately, killing and wounding numerous people. He first shot people on the island and later started shooting at people who were trying to escape by swimming across the lake. Survivors on the island described a scene of terror. Survivor Dana Barzingi, then 21, described how several victims wounded by Breivik pretended to be dead, but he came back and shot them again. He spared an 11-year-old boy who had lost his father (Trond Berntsen) during the shooting and stood up against him and said he was too young to die, as well as a 22-year-old man who begged for his life.\n\nSome witnesses hid in undergrowth and lavatories, communicating by text message to avoid revealing their positions. The mass shooting lasted for around an hour and a half, ending when a police special task force arrived and Brevik surrendered, despite having ammunition left, at 18:35. The shooter used hollow-point or frangible bullets which increase tissue damage. Breivik repeatedly shouted \"You are going to die today, Marxists!\"\n\nB\u00f8sei's husband and one of her daughters, who were also present, survived. The youngest victim, New Zealand-born Sharidyn Svebakk-B\u00f8hn of Drammen, was 14 years old. 16-year-old Andrine Bakkene Espeland of Sarpsborg was the last victim, nearly one hour after the shooting began.\n\nResidents in a flotilla of motorboats and fishing dinghies sailed out to rescue the survivors, who were pulled out shivering and bleeding from the water and picked up from hiding places in the bushes and behind rocks around the island's shoreline. Some survived by pretending to be dead. Several campers, especially those who knew the island well, swam to the island's rocky west side and hid in the caves which are only accessible from the water. Others were able to hide away on the secluded Kj\u00e6rlighetsstien (\"love path\"). Forty-seven of the campers sought refuge in Skolestua (\"the School House\") together with personnel from the Norwegian People's Aid. Although Breivik fired two bullets through the door, he did not get through the locked door, and the people inside this building survived.\n\nThe teenagers said that they had decided that it was too difficult to stop the gunman. They discovered a cave-like opening in a rock where they hid 23 children from Breivik. Dzhamayev, who kept guard outside, also dragged three youngsters from the lake who were close to drowning.\n\nFormer prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, whom Breivik said he hated and, in a pun on the (more or less ironic) epithet Landsmoderen (\"mother of the nation\"), referred to in his writings as landsmorderen (\"murderer of the nation\"), had been on the island earlier in the day to give a speech to the camp. After the attack Breivik stated that he originally wanted to target her specifically; but because of delays related to the renovation of Oslo Central railway station, he arrived after she had already left.\n\n===Rescue and emergency response===\nThe first shot was fired at 17:22. The emergency medical services were informed about the shooting two minutes later. One minute after that the police in Oslo were informed. They immediately tried to reach Ut\u00f8ya as quickly as possible, but did not have a helicopter that could take them straight to the island. By 17:30, the anti-terror police in Oslo (the Emergency Response Unit) were on the way to Ut\u00f8ya by automobile.\n\nOne of the first to arrive on the scene was Marcel Gleffe, a German resident of Ski staying at Utvika Camping on the mainland. Recognizing gunshots, he piloted his boat to the island and began throwing life-jackets to young people in the water, rescuing as many as he could in four or five trips, after which the police asked him to stop. The Daily Telegraph credited him with saving up to 30 lives. Another forty were saved by Hege Dalen and Toril Hansen, a married couple on vacation in the area. Dalen was helping from land while Hansen and a neighbour camper made several trips to rescue people in the water. Several dozen more were rescued by Kasper Ilaug, who made three trips to the island. Ilaug, a local resident, received a telephone call that \"something terrible\" was happening on Ut\u00f8ya and requesting help. He initially thought the call was a prank, but acted anyway. Altogether, some 150 who swam away from the island were pulled out of the lake by campers on the opposite shore.\n\nThe anti-terror police reached the meeting point at 18:09, but had to wait a few minutes for a boat to take them across. They reached Ut\u00f8ya at 18:25. When confronted by the heavily armed police on the island, the gunman initially hesitated for a few seconds. When an officer yelled \"surrender or be shot\" he laid down his weapons.\n\nAnders Breivik called the 112 emergency phone number at least twice to surrender, at 18:01 and 18:26, and continued killing people in between. The police say Breivik hung up both times; they tried to call him back but did not succeed.\n\nWhen the police arrived at the scene, they were met by survivors begging the officers to throw away their weapons, as they were afraid that the men in uniforms would again open fire on them.\n\nDuring the attack, 69 people were killed, and of the 517 survivors, 66 were wounded.\n\n====Shortage of transport capacity====\nThe Norwegian police do not have helicopters suitable for transporting groups of police for an airdrop. The one they have is useful only for surveillance and the helicopter crew were on holiday.\n\nWhen the local police arrived at Ut\u00f8ykaia, less than 30 minutes after the first shot was fired, they could not find a suitable boat to reach the island. They were then ordered to observe and report.\n\nAUF's own ferry, the 50 passenger MS Thorbj\u00f8rn, was used by Breivik to go to Ut\u00f8ya. Shortly after the first shot was fired, nine people were leaving the island on the ferry, among them the AUF leader Eskil Pedersen. They feared there might be more terrorists in the area and navigated the ferry  to the north. Hence the ferry was not available to the police when they arrived at Ut\u00f8ykaia, the normal ferry landing on the mainland.\n\nThe police therefore had to use their own rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB). The day of the event, this boat was located in H\u00f8nefoss, and had to be transported to the lake and launched before it could be used. When the anti-terror police boarded the RHIB it took on some water and after a few hundred meters, the engine stopped, probably due to water in the fuel. Two minutes later they took over a civilian boat that was sent to assist them. The episode was captured on video. A minute or two after the video ends, a faster civilian boat arrived to help. Four police officers from the anti-terror police boarded the boat. Not wanting to waste any more time, the civilian couple took the police to Ut\u00f8ya.\n\nSome have criticised the police for not using a helicopter, for not immediately getting into small boats, and for endangering the couple who drove the civilian boat.\n\n===Arrest of innocent survivor===\nOn arriving in Ut\u00f8ya, the police arrested, in addition to Breivik, Anzor Djoukaev, an innocent 17-year-old survivor who represented the Akershus branch of AUF. The youth was reportedly stripped naked and locked up in a jail cell, located only meters away from the cell housing the self-confessed killer. The victim, who as a child had witnessed mass murders in Chechnya, was suspected of being an accomplice because his haircut was different from that shown on his identity document, and because he did not react to the carnage with the same tears and hysteria as most of the other survivors. He was kept in custody for seventeen hours. Lawyer Harald Stabell criticized the police for failing to contact the youth's family, who feared he was killed, and for interrogating the victim without a lawyer present.\n\n==Casualties==\n\nThe attacks were the deadliest in Norway since World War II, and a survey found that one in four Norwegians knew \"someone affected by the attacks\". It is also the fifth deadliest terrestrial terrorist attack in Western Europe behind the Bologna bombing in 1980, the Nice attack in 2016, the Paris attacks in November 2015, and the Madrid train bombings in 2004.\n\n===Oslo===\nEight people were killed in the explosion; the blast, shock wave and debris immediately killed six people, while two others died quickly afterwards from their wounds. Of the 325 people estimated to have been in the government buildings, around them and in the surrounding area, at least 209 people received physical injuries from the blast and debris. While most were relatively minor and could be treated at the local casualty clinic, 12 people received more serious injuries. Ten were sent to Ullev\u00e5l University Hospital (OUS, Ullev\u00e5l), four with moderate to serious and six with critical injuries, and two to Aker University Hospital (OUS, Aker). A doctor at one of the Oslo University Hospitals (OUS) said the hospital staff were treating head, chest and abdominal wounds.\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Jens Stoltenberg was at his official residence near the Royal Palace, preparing the speech he was scheduled to give at Ut\u00f8ya the next day. Norway's finance minister, Sigbj\u00f8rn Johnsen, was on vacation in Denmark at the time.\n\nFewer people than usual were in the area because the bombing took place during July, the usual holiday month for Norwegians, and since it was Friday afternoon, most government employees had gone home for the weekend.\n\n===Ut\u00f8ya===\nThe scope of what happened at the island was initially very confusing, and the first official figures given was that at least 10 people had been killed. As the evening progressed several eyewitness reports put this number in doubt, and at approximately 03:50 (CEST) on 23 July, NRK1 and TV2, the two primary Norwegian television networks, broadcast a live press conference from the \"Sentrum politistasjon\" in Oslo where Norway's National Police Commissioner \u00d8ystein M\u00e6land stated the number of fatalities at Ut\u00f8ya to have reached \"at least 80\" with the count expected to increase.\n\nOn 25 July, a police spokesperson revealed that the death toll of the victims on Ut\u00f8ya had been revised downwards to 68 after the casualties had been counted on their return to the mainland. They added that the number of people missing was still high and that the number of casualties could be as high as 86. On 29 July police announced that one of the severely wounded victims from Ut\u00f8ya had died in hospital, bringing the death toll from the island massacre to 69.\n\nOn 26 July, the Norwegian police began releasing the names and dates of birth of the victims on their website. By 29 July, the names of all 77 victims (8 from the bomb attack, 69 from Ut\u00f8ya) had been published, the last, a shooting victim, having been found on the 28th.\n\n\n\nOf the 69 people who died at the attack on the island, 57 were killed by one or more shots through the head. In total, 67 people were killed by gunshots, 1 died falling from a cliff trying to escape, and 1 drowned trying to swim away from the island. In total, Breivik fired at least 186 shots, and still had a \"considerable amount of ammunition\" left.\n\nIn the aftermath, of the 564 people on the island at the time, 69 people died and at least 110 people had received various physical injuries. An estimated 50 people were treated at the locally set up casualty clinic, and were treated for relatively minor injuries such as cuts, bruises and hypothermia after fleeing and swimming from the island. It was cloudy and rainy on Ut\u00f8ya that day, air temperature was varying between , water temperature around the island was 14\u00a0\u00b0C and the shortest distance to the mainland was around 600 meters. Sixty people were transported to surrounding hospitals, 55 with serious to critical injuries. The chief surgeon who treated the wounds at one of the hospitals said he had never seen similar wounds during his 23 years of practice, and explained that the bullets were extremely fragmented in their path through the body. Thirty-three people had been directly hit by one or more bullets and survived, but one person who was shot died two days later in hospital from the bullet wounds to the head and back.\n\nThe 564 people on the island at the time were from all over Norway as well as some visitors from foreign countries. The people who died were from 18 of Norway's 19 counties, and also a woman from Georgia. Wounded people were from the entire country, including Svalbard, and together with the casualties from Oslo, an average of a quarter of Norway's population knew a victim affected by the attacks, according to a survey done. Several of the dead and wounded, or their parents, were personal friends of high-ranking government ministers. Trond Berntsen, an off-duty, unarmed police officer and step-brother of Norway's crown princess Mette-Marit, was the first to be shot dead.\n\n==Perpetrator==\n\n\nPublic broadcaster NRK and several other Norwegian media outlets identified the suspected attacker as Anders Behring Breivik. He was arrested on Ut\u00f8ya for the shootings and also linked to the Oslo bombing. He was charged with terrorism for both attacks. According to his attorney, Breivik acknowledged that he was responsible for both the bomb and the shooting during interrogation but denied culpability, as he asserted that his actions were \"atrocious but necessary\". At his initial arraignment on 25 July, Breivik was remanded into custody for eight weeks, the first half to be in solitary confinement. Breivik wanted to have an open hearing, and attend it wearing a uniform of his own design, but both requests were denied by the presiding judge. \n\n===Mental health===\nFollowing his arrest, Breivik underwent examination by court-appointed forensic psychiatrists, who diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia and concluded he had been psychotic at the time of the attacks and was criminally insane. Although criticised in newspaper debates, the submitted report was approved with no remarks by the Norwegian Board of Forensic Medicine after an extended panel of experts had reviewed it.\n\nAccording to his defense attorney, Breivik initially expressed surprise and felt insulted by the conclusions in the report. He later stated that \"this provides new opportunities\". Following the criticism of the psychiatric report, the court in January 2012 approved the conduct of a second psychiatric examination. The report from this examination declared Breivik to be sane in April 2012. Ultimately, the verdict and ruling of the district court's five-judge panel agreed that Breivik was sane.\n\n===Political and religious views===\nBreivik is linked to a 1,518-page compendium entitled 2083: A European Declaration of Independence bearing the name \"Andrew Berwick\". The file was e-mailed to 1,003 addresses about 90 minutes before the bomb blast in Oslo. Analysts described him as having Islamophobic views and a hatred of Islam, and as someone who considered himself as a knight dedicated to stemming the tide of Muslim immigration into Europe.\n\nThe introductory chapter of the manifesto defining \"cultural Marxism\" is a copy of Political Correctness: A Short History of an Ideology by the Free Congress Foundation. Major parts of the compendium are attributed to the pseudonymous Norwegian blogger Fjordman. The text also copies sections of the Unabomber manifesto, without giving credit, while substituting the words \"cultural Marxists\" for \"leftists\" and \"Muslims\" for \"black people\". The New York Times described American influences in the writings, noting that the compendium mentions the anti-Islamist American Robert Spencer 64 times and cites Spencer's works at great length. The work of Bat Ye'or is cited dozens of times. Far-right and anti-Islam activist blogger Pamela Geller, Neo-pagan writer Koenraad Elst and Daniel Pipes are also mentioned as sources of inspiration. The manifesto further contains quotes from Middle East expert Bernard Lewis, Edmund Burke, Mahatma Gandhi, Thomas Jefferson and George Orwell, as well as from Jeremy Clarkson's Sunday Times column and Melanie Phillips' Daily Mail column. The publication speaks in admiration of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Bruce Bawer, Sr\u0111a Trifkovi\u0107, and Henryk M. Broder. The compendium advocates a restoration of patriarchy, which it claims would save European culture.\n\nThe compendium contains his militant far-right ideology and xenophobic worldview, which espouses an array of political concepts; including support for varying degrees of cultural conservatism, right-wing populism, ultranationalism, Islamophobia, far-right Zionism, and Serbian paramilitarism. It regards Islam and \"cultural Marxism\" as the enemy and argues for the annihilation of \"Eurabia\" and multiculturalism, to preserve a Christian Europe. He further urged Europeans to restore the historic crusades against Islam as in the Middle Ages. A video Breivik released on YouTube 6 hours before the attack has been described as promoting violence towards leftists and Islamists who reside in Western Europe.\n\nAmong other things, in the manifesto he identified the Bene\u0161 Decrees, which facilitated the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia after the Second World War, as an example for committing that act on European Muslims. In his manifesto he also urges the Hindus to drive Muslims out of India. He demands the gradual deportation of all Muslims from Europe from 2011 to 2083 through repatriation. He blames feminism for allowing the erosion of the fabric of European society.\n\nBreivik's writings mention the English Defence League, claiming that he had contact with senior members of the EDL, and that a Norwegian version of the group was 'in the process of gaining strength'. He wrote that the EDL were 'na\u00efve fools' because in his words the EDL 'harshly condemns any and all revolutionary conservative movements that employ terror as a tool'. EDL leader Tommy Robinson denounced Breivik and the attack on 26 July 2011 and denied any links with the Norwegian.\n\nAfter being apprehended, Breivik was characterized by police officials as being a right-wing extremist. Breivik is described by the newspaper Verdens Gang as considering himself a conservative nationalist. According to The Australian, Breivik was highly critical of Muslim immigration into Christian societies, is pro-Israel and an admirer of the Tea Party movement in the United States. Deputy police chief Roger Andresen initially told reporters that \"We have no more information than\u00a0... what has been found on [his] own websites, which is that it goes towards the right and that it is, so to speak, Christian fundamentalist.\" Subsequently, others have disputed Andresen's characterization of Breivik as a Christian fundamentalist. Furthermore, Breivik stated that \"myself and many more like me do not necessarily have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and God.\" According to the International Business Times, in his manifesto, he \"did not see himself as religious\", but he did identify as a cultural Christian and wrote about the differences between cultural and religious Christians, but stressed that both were Christians, and shared the same identity and goals. After his imprisonment, Breivik stated he had never personally identified as a Christian, and called his religion Odinism, stating that he would \"pray and sacrifice\" to Odin. He also identified himself as a fascist and a national socialist, stating that he previously exploited counterjihadist rhetoric in order to protect \"ethno-nationalists\".\n\nHe has written many posts on the far-right website document.no. He attended meetings of \"Documents venner\" (Friends of Document), affiliated with the Document.no website. He is a former member of the Progress Party (FrP) and its youth wing FpU. According to the current FpU leader Ove Vanebo, Breivik was active early in the 2000s, but he left the party as his viewpoints became more extreme.\n\nIn his online YouTube video, he expressed admiration of past European leaders who waged war against Islam and Muslims, naming Charles Martel, Richard the Lionheart, El Cid, Vlad the Impaler, Jacques de Molay, Tsar Nicholas, and John III Sobieski. A recently created social media website bearing Breivik's name and picture but of unknown authorship refers to him as an admirer of Winston Churchill and Max Manus, and also of controversial Dutch politician Geert Wilders, whose political party, the Party for Freedom, he describes as \"the only true party of conservatives\". The music that is played in the video comes off the soundtrack to the video game Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures.\n\n===Unsubstantiated claims of Breivik being assisted===\nThere was suspicion at the time of the attack that there were accomplices, and the police initially prepared to meet two to five shooters on Ut\u00f8ya. Several youths at Ut\u00f8ya reported to be convinced that there was more than one shooter, with some reports of shots fired from the mainland. A second shooter at Ut\u00f8ya was described by several youths as having thick dark hair, about 1.80 meters tall who did not wear a police uniform, while carrying a pistol and a rifle. During judicial examination, at least two witnesses independently of each other both described two different shooters at Ut\u00f8ya, while a third witness was reported to have swum from the island beside a previously unknown dark-haired man. After his arrest Breivik claimed he acted with accomplices, but later changed his statements to his acting alone, giving several demands for him to tell about accomplices. On 24 July 2011, six people were arrested in Oslo suspected of having connections with the attacks; all were released. The police later issued a statement that there was only found evidence of one shooter at Ut\u00f8ya, amid \"widespread conspiracy theories\" of there having been more than one shooter.\n\nIn the initial hours after the attacks, the group Ansar al-Jihad al-Alami led by Abu Suleiman al-Naser claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\n==Reactions==\n\n\n\n===Domestic===\nKing Harald V sent his condolences to the victims and their families, and urged unity. He and Queen Sonja personally visited the victims of the attacks, as well as the families of those killed.\n\nAt a press conference the morning after the attacks, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg and Justice Minister Knut Storberget addressed the country. Stoltenberg called the attack a \"national tragedy\" and the worst atrocity in Norway since World War II. Stoltenberg further vowed that the attack would not hurt Norwegian democracy, and said the proper answer to the violence was \"more democracy, more openness, but not naivety\". In his speech at the memorial service on 24 July 2011, he opined what would be a proper reaction: \"No one has said it better than the AUF girl who was interviewed by CNN: 'If one man can show so much hate, think how much love we could show, standing together.'\"\n\n\n\nThe leader of the Workers' Youth League, Eskil Pedersen, vowed to \"return to Ut\u00f8ya\" and urged Norway to continue its tradition of openness and tolerance.\n\nLeaders of Norwegian political parties expressed grief and sent condolences in public statements.\n\nOn 1 August 2011, Norway's parliament, nominally in recess for the summer, reconvened for an extraordinary session to honour the victims of the attack. In a departure from parliamentary procedure, both King Harald V and Crown Prince Haakon were present. The president of Norway's Parliament, Dag Terje Andersen, read out loud the names of all 77 victims. The session was open to the public, but due to limited seating, priority was given to relatives of the deceased.\n\nThe seven political parties in the parliament agreed to postpone the electoral campaign for local elections, held in September, until mid-August. School debates were cancelled, though the school elections were not.\n\nInitially, Magnus Ranstorp and other terror experts suspected that foreigners were behind the attacks. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, there were wide reports in mainstream media of non-ethnic Norwegians, especially Muslim Norwegians, being subjected to harassment and violence. A report about these racist attacks was published on behalf of the 22. July Commission in 2012.\n\nOn 13 August 2012, Norway's prime minister received the Gj\u00f8rv Report, which concludes that Breivik could have been stopped from carrying out the Ut\u00f8ya massacre. (The report had been ordered by parliament, in August 2011.)\n\n===International===\nThe United Nations, the European Union, NATO, and governments around the world expressed their condemnation of the attacks, condolences, and solidarity with Norway. However, there have also been reports of Western European right-wing populist politicians giving support to the killings or excusing them as a result of multi-culturalism. Interviewed on a popular radio show, the Italian MEP Francesco Speroni, a leading member of the Lega Nord, the junior partner in Berlusconi's conservative coalition, said: \"Breivik's ideas are in defence of western civilisation.\" Similar views were voiced by Italian MEP Mario Borghezio. Werner Koenigshofer, a member of the National Council of Austria, was expelled from the right-wing Freedom Party of Austria after equating the massacre with the death of millions of fetuses through abortion.\n\nOn 25 July 2011, at noon (CEST), each of the Nordic countries held a minute of silence to dignify the victims of the two attacks. Norway's minute of silence stretched to five minutes. In Oslo, a city of approximately 600,000 inhabitants, an estimated 200,000 people attended a \"flower march\".\n\nThe Norwegian media reported criticism against Fox News and its commentator Glenn Beck for their coverage of the attacks. Beck's comparison of the AUF to the Hitler Youth led Frank Aarebrot, a Norwegian professor with political sympathies to the Norwegian Labour Party, to call Beck a \"fascist\" and \"swine\".\n\n===Memorial ceremonies===\nA number of memorial ceremonies took place following the attacks. On 25 July 2011, around 200,000 people took part in a \"rose march\" at R\u00e5dhusplassen in Oslo. The NRK memorial concert, titled \"Mitt lille land\" (\"My Little Country\") and named for the song \"Mitt lille land\" which \"came to symbolize the sorrow many people went through\", took place in Oslo Cathedral on 30 July 2011. A national memorial ceremony took place on 21 August 2011. In September 2011, the Norwegian People's Aid and Sony Music released the memorial album Mitt lille land.\n\n===Memorials and symbol===\nA minnestein (\"memorial stone\") to commemorate the attacks at Ut\u00f8ya is located at a roadside rest area with a view of Ut\u00f8ya that is located on E16 at Nes in Hole (municipality).\n\nAt Ut\u00f8ya, the place of memorial is called [\"the clearing\"] \"Lysninga\"; a part of it is [\"the ring\"] \"Ringen\" \u2013 a \"ring of steel [that] hangs between trees and here the names and age of the majority of those 69 killed are engraved\"; \"it lies at the highest point of the island\"; It was unveiled during summer 2015. Hegnhuset was inaugurated in 2016, and media were allowed to photograph its interior including items of memorial after the bereaved who chose to come, had seen the interior.\n\nOne monolith stands in each municipality. There are memorials in the 53 affected municipalities in Norway who welcomed the same sculpture, funded by a private donation, created by the artist Nico Widerberg.\n\nA temporary national monument in Oslo was unveiled on 22 July 2016. On 20 September 2016 media said that a planned permanent, national memorial in Oslo at Regjeringskvartalet is dependent on a memorial at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten being constructed as planned. But the government has opened for scrapping Dahlberg's design.\n\nAnother proposed monument in Oslo, at Stensparken, including metal roses, has not been authorized, as its planned dimensions of  by , with a height of , were judged to be too overwhelming. 900 roses, still in storage, have been donated from persons in various countries; one rose was created by a survivor, and some by others who were bereaved; Tobbe Malm is one of those who came up with the idea of using iron roses.\n\n====National memorial at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten, in limbo====\n\n, Hole Municipality has stopped case work regarding the request for permission to build a national monument at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten; media said that the case work could be arrested for around two and a half years or longer. The government is scheduled to be a defendant in court during a three-week trial, starting 25 April 2017; the underlying lawsuit aims to deny construction at the planned location.\n\nPreviously, in March 2016 the location for a planned national place of memorial was moved from Ut\u00f8ya to S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten \u2013 located on the mainland  from Utvika and   from Ut\u00f8ya; in September 2014 the Hole municipal council had refused a memorial at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten. The names of several of the victims are reportedly being denied (, by next of kin) as inscriptions on the planned monument.\n\nA committee, Kunstutvalget for minnestaden for 22. juli, chose  a design by Jonas Dahlberg for the monument, and Karin Moe has called the planned monument at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten \u2014 \"Breivik's Memorial Place\". Later, in a Klassekampen article Moe said that \"Many of the [local] inhabitants have described [..] the design as a violation, even a rape of nature [that is in place] at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten. Such is the intensity of how the memorial is being felt, that physical pain is felt merely by imagining having to face the memorial every day. The traumatised neighbors re-live the acts of terror through the brutal cut into the mountain slope [...] a reminder of who acted: Anders Behring Breivik. Here his misdeed is carved in stone. No wonder that fear lies in the reactions. [...] The baffling thing for the locals is this: [...], but we were supposed to be honored \u2013 not re-traumatised. Why must this incurable memorial-wound be inflicted on us, so close to [our bodies or our] life\". Furthermore, she said that \"Long time was needed before the September 11 memorial place on Manhattan was in place. Now an encompassing \u2013 in regard to ethics and aesthetics \u2013 pause for thinking is needed \u2013 both for the placement and the final design of the memorial\". A later article suggested that \"we create the monument as envisioned, but fill the scar with rock and beautify the surface\", inspired by kintsugi. A later article said that \"What many of us don't understand is why these plans, apparently not well-considered, now are pushed through. (...) Is it [because of] prestige or out of consideration to the artist\"?\n\nMinister of Local Government and Modernisation has been criticised for announcing \u2013 while Breivik was a plaintiff in a 4-day trial \u2013 the [current] decision to construct the monument.\n\nOn 14 April 2016 media said that a \"report has indicated that the place of memorial will create great mental strains on the persons living in its close proximity\"; The report, Nasjonalt kunnskapssenter om vold og traumatisk stress a\/s, was completed in April 2015. A later newspaper article asked \"And why should the little island [sic], [S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten be punished with the j\u00f6tunn cut \u2013 what wrong has the island done?\" On 16 April 2016 media quoted board member Anne-Gry Ruud of neighborhood association, Utstranda Velforening: \"I don't think that the work of art honors all who were killed, but symbolizes only pain and open wounds. (...) If this work of art gives any associations, then they are to terror, death, pain and the inadequacy of society. (...) This is not just a small cut on a point \u2013 it is an area of 1.2 decare [that will become surrounded by water] (...). I don't think that the [local] inhabitants have a responsibility to provide a location for a memorial at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten. Especially in the summer we experience a steady flow of tourists on a pilgrimage to S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten. Some take selfies with Ut\u00f8ya in the background. Others stop the inhabitants and ask what they did that day and how we contributed. (...) We have two schoolbuses that drive back and forth every day on the road just above, others pass on their way to the store, leisure activities, work or municipal center (...) 260 inhabitants\".\n\nThe national convention of the Progress Party decided to say \"no\" to placing the memorial at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten.\n\nOn 25 April 2016 Hole Municipal Council decided to fund Norwegian kroner 25,000 to Utstranda Velforening, for a proposed lawsuit against the government.\n\nIn a 14 May 2016 Aftenposten article , a film director and -producer, said that the monument of the original contest was supposed to have a price limited to Norwegian kroner 20 million; now that the government has estimated the price to 70 million including relevant extra expenses, the contestants that operated within the original price limits have been deceived.\n\nIn May 2016 the government wrote that the ongoing lawsuit about [placing] the monument [at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten], will not change the government's plans; the letter was signed by Minister of Local Government and Modernisation and Minister of Culture.\n\nIn an 11 June 2016 Dagbladet article Hans Normann Dahl was quoted, \"The monument itself is incomprehensible, and the idea so crass that it contains a negative and destructive material\".\n\nAn 18 June 2016 Dagbladet article quoted (writings of) one mother (Gunn Rusten) who lost her daughter: \"My daughter's name will NOT be displayed on any memorial at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten, but it is displayed at Ut\u00f8ya\". She added that \"Why should all the phenomenal persons living there, and who put their lives on the line that day \u2013 to save as many as possible of those on Ut\u00f8ya [who were later rescued from the lake] \u2014 have this as a lifelong, daily reminder of the fateful Friday when police and those in charge let a crazy man walk around for around an hour and a half \u2013 and kill at will \u2013 without intervening\". Furthermore, another mother (Mai Britt Rogne) who lost her daughter said that: \"We already have the grave, [and] Ut\u00f8ya, and one monolith in every municipality. How many places of memorial do we need\"?\n\nOn 24 June 2016 the government was sued (in Ringerike District Court) with a claim that \"The government is being denied construction of the memorial Memory Wound, including a parking lot, a footpath, and auxiliary developments at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten and Bergli [both] in Hole\".\n\n the government has offered to ditch the \"Memory Wound\"  draft for a monument; the site for a national memorial at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten, remains unchanged.\n\nSwedish psychiatrist Per-Olof Michel said \"I have been thinking why the government was in such a hurry. In Sweden one will be unveiling the Tsunami Monument next year \u2013 13 years after the fact. Regarding something that affects so many people, on should let time pass and go thru things again\".\n\nBodil Cappelen said in a Klassekampen article that \"Centuries will pass ... Oh, yes. Here they have cut off a point\u2014from the mountain mama. A landscape was not that much worth\u2014then\".\n\nRegarding \"Memory Wound\" possibly being plagiarism of one of 300 candidate proposals for the pre-qualification in the contest for monument design, art historian  said that \"My first impression was that this is closest [to] plagiarism\"; \"But when the idea is so similar, I think one should examine the case further\"; [the final written work for the master's degree,] masteroppgaven, of architect students Kristin Ulrikke R\u00f8nnestad og Hildegunn Slotn\u00e6s had already been published on NTNU's website, and had been exhibited in Trondheim, and had been mailed to around 200 persons and offices.\nSo far the case has led to: government agency  informing Dahlberg and the Department of Culture of potential allegations of plagiarism; Dahlberg denied any knowledge of masteroppgaven; student R\u00f8nnestad met with the director of KORO in April 2014. The lawyer (from the architects' trade union) that accompanied R\u00f8nnestad there, said that KORO showed \"a quite condescending attitude towards her\". Other views regarding the case includes the view of Arve R\u00f8d, art critic of Dagbladet, saying about the sketches \"The likeness is peculiar, and impossible to overlook. It is difficult not to conclude that these are two completely alike ideas, but I can not from that claim that Dahlberg has plagiarized the work of the two students\"; he thinks that it is quite remarkable that [two] ideas, so alike, were found in the same contest and situation, in the same place and at the same time.\n\nIn November 2016 news broke that case work regarding the request for permission to build the monument at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten, had been arrested in September; Hole municipality's justification, cited in part the upcoming court case.\n\n====The preserved, shattered display case for newspaper pages====\n\nA newspaper display case that was collaterally damaged has been left unrepaired with its glass fractured but not dislocated by the shockwave of the bomb. It has later been moved across the street \u2013 Akersgata \u2013 from outside the headquarters of Verdens Gang. Artist Ahmad Ghossein took the initiative to create a memorial from the shattered display. The newspaper edition from the day of the bombing, is still on display.\n\n===Attempts at art creation===\n\nA 2016 Norwegian news article said that \"Most of those that work in the field of art, probably were aware of the support group's [\"the national support group after 22 July incidents\"  ] marked attempts at stopping the Danish playwright   when he wanted to stage a drama based on the terrorist's manuscript. Artists are in fact not as daring, as many like to think\".\n\n\n==Legal proceedings==\n\nThe police initially kept the choice of counsel secret after request from the attorney. Attorney Geir Lippestad elected to act on behalf of Breivik's defense; Breivik had specifically requested that Lippestad become his attorney.\n\nOn 25 July 2011, Anders Behring Breivik was arraigned in Oslo District Court. The police feared that Breivik would use the hearing as an opportunity to communicate with possible accomplices. Because of this, the arraignment was held completely closed to the media and all other spectators. Instead, judge Kim Heger held a press conference shortly afterwards where he read the court's decision. The practice of completely closed court hearings is extremely rare in the Norwegian justice system.\n\nThe debate over which criminal charges to file was fierce. Many police attorneys wanted high treason or crimes against humanity. The prosecution ended up indicting Breivik on terrorism charges. Breivik admitted to being the gunman at Ut\u00f8ya and the perpetrator behind the Oslo bomb, also admitting all the other actual events. Nonetheless he pleaded not guilty, stating \"I do not recognise this justice system\". District Attorney Christian Hatlo asked that Breivik be detained for eight weeks without mail or visitation. The judge ruled in favor of the prosecution, stating \"the accused is an imminent danger to society and must be confined for the safety of himself and others. It is highly probable that he is guilty of the alleged crimes and imprisonment is necessary to prevent destruction of evidence\". In accordance with the prosecution's wishes, Breivik was remanded to eight weeks detention without mail or visitation, four of those in complete isolation, to be renewed no later than 19 September 2011. He was immediately transferred to Ila Landsfengsel, a maximum security prison.\n\nOn 13 August 2011 Breivik was taken to Ut\u00f8ya by police to recreate his actions on the day of the massacre. Neither the media nor the public was alerted to the operation. The police explained that the surprise walk-through was necessary because Breivik will be charged and tried for all 77 murders individually. The police deemed it less offensive to the survivors to do it now rather than during the trial. Despite the many police boats and helicopters, none of the civilians who had come to lay down flowers on the shore this day perceived what was happening just a few hundred metres across the lake from them for a total of eight hours. On the evening of 14 August the police held a press conference about the reconstruction. It was reported that Breivik was not unmoved by his return to Ut\u00f8ya, but that he showed no remorse. Inspector P\u00e5l Fredrik Hjort Kraby described Breivik's behavior and indifference on the island as \"unreal\", as he had over the course of eight hours willingly showed the police exactly how he had carried out all of the 69 murders.\n\nThe trial began on 16 April 2012 and lasted until 19 June 2012. 170 media organisations were accredited to cover the proceedings. Anders Behring Breivik acknowledged that he had committed the offences but pleaded not guilty as he believed the killing was needed. The main issue for Breivik was that he was not to be deemed \"insane\" or \"psychotic\", because that would lose the meaning of his message.\n\nOn 24 August, Breivik was found to be sane by the panel of five judges. He was sentenced to preventative detention (forvaring), a sentence of 21 years in prison which can be repeatedly extended by 5 years as long as he is considered a threat to society. This is the maximum sentence allowed by Norwegian law, and it is the only way to allow for life imprisonment.\n\n==After-effects==\n\n===In Norway===\nCoop Norway, a chain of retail stores in Norway, removed several games from its shelves as a result of the attack. Some of the titles includes games like Homefront, Call of Duty series, Sniper Ghost Warrior, Counter-Strike Source and World of Warcraft. Some games were also temporarily removed from the Norwegian WiiWare catalog, including an on-rails shooter game.\n\nIn the days following the attacks, Norway's largest represented political parties noted a significant increase in interest for membership from young people. Both the Norwegian Young Conservatives and the Progress Party's Youth, as well as the Workers' Youth League (AUF) had signed up a significant number of new members after a few days. The mother parties also reported an unusual increase in new member applications, with the Conservative Party and the Progress Party having signed up almost 1,000 new members each by early August, while the Labour Party reported over 6,000 new members at the end of the month.\n\nFar-right groups such as Stop the Islamisation of Norway (SIAN) and the Norwegian Defence League (NDL), as well as the Democrats, had reportedly witnessed a boom in their memberships and interest by mid-August, with the Democrats party having signed up around one hundred new members, and the NDL around three hundred.\n\nIn the September local elections almost two months after the attacks, gains were made by the Conservative Party (up 9% to 28%), and to a lesser extent the Labour Party (up 2% to 32%). On the other hand, setbacks were witnessed by the Progress Party, the party Breivik had been a member of, (down 6% to 11%) and the Socialist Left Party (down 2% to 4%).\n\nIn the Gj\u00f8rv Report, received by the prime minister in advance of a press conference on 13 August 2012, it was concluded that more actions could have been taken by authorities, to stop Breivik, to track him, or to interrupt his attacks. It also criticised the police action, in stark contrast to an internal report issued by the police earlier. A few days later, national police chief \u00d8ystein M\u00e6land submitted his resignation, citing a lack of clear support for his position from his superiors and saying: \"If the [justice] ministry and other political authorities do not clarify this matter unequivocally, it will become impossible for me to continue.\" His resignation was accepted and announced by Justice Minister Grete Faremo.\n\nVegard Groeslie Wennesland, a survivor of the incident, ran for parliament on a Labour Party ticket in the 2013 Norwegian parliamentary election which brought a coalition government of the Conservative party and the right-wing Progress Party, of which Breivik had been a member from 1999 until 2004, to power.\n\nIn 2013 former AUF local leader and Labour Party cabinet advisor Ivar Fjeld released the pamphlet Den r\u00f8dgr\u00f8nne terror\u00f8ya (\"The Red-Green Terror Island\"), which documented how Ut\u00f8ya over several years had been used to build up support for anti-Israel politics and Palestinian terrorists. In the book he documents among other things that AUF had allowed far-left Red Youth to arrange camps on Ut\u00f8ya, who collected money for and welcomed representatives from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) on the island. Fjeld claimed that his purpose with the book was to warn the Labour Party about the activities of its increasingly radicalised and Islamised youth organisation.\n\n===Czech copycat===\n\n\nOn 10 August 2012, the Rapid Reaction Unit (URNA) of the Czech Police, backed up by a local SWAT unit and over 100 other policemen, arrested a 29-year-old admirer of Breivik, Vojt\u011bch Ml\u00fdnek, in Ostrava, the Czech Republic's third largest city. The police suspected that Ml\u00fdnek was preparing a copycat attack inspired by the 2011 Norway attacks. He was stockpiling weapons (including a fully automatic assault rifle and armor-piercing bullets) and had converted an aerial bomb in order to be able to remotely detonate it. Ml\u00fdnek had the remote control with him while arrested. He had also obtained uniforms of the Czech police and of the Czech prison service and a police ID.\n\nMl\u00fdnek, who was using the pseudonym Anders Behring Breivik in electronic communication, has had a history of four prior criminal convictions, including a six-month-long suspended sentence for setting off an explosive which demolished an empty wooden cottage.\n\nMl\u00fdnek was initially charged with endangering public and with illegal arming, which carried a penalty from three to eight years in prison. He was first held in a remand prison, but was transferred to an isolation unit of prison hospital in Brno following a psychiatric evaluation. On 3 April 2013, a court in Ostrava found Ml\u00fdnek criminally insane. At the same time he was found dangerous to the public and ordered psychiatric detention. The reasons for detention will be reviewed by the court periodically every two years. Police determined that Ml\u00fdnek, despite being a Breivik sympathizer, was not preparing an actual terrorist attack; however, he suffered from paranoia and was stockpiling the weapons and bombs with the aim of self-defense.\n\n===Polish copycat===\n\nOn 20 November 2012 the Polish authorities announced the arrest of a 45-year-old lecturer in chemical engineering at the Agricultural University of Cracow under suspicion of preparing a similar attack. According to the authorities,  was an admirer of Breivik and was further inspired by the Oklahoma City bombing.\n\nPoland's Internal Security Agency (ABW) first found out about Kwiecie\u0144 after it launched investigation into Breivik's Polish contacts when it became known that Breivik had ordered some of the chemicals for his bomb from Poland via internet. According to ABW, Kwiecie\u0144 was preparing an attack against the Sejm, the lower house of the Polish parliament. He wanted to detonate  of explosives in a car bomb parked at the building during deliberation of the next year's budget, as it is the time when all the members of parliament, the Prime Minister as well as the President are all present in the building.\n\nKwiecie\u0144 tried to arm himself already in 1997, however the authorities refused his application for a firearm permit. He later started arming himself illegally, mostly with weapons bought in Belgium. He bought firearms, ammunition, bulletproof vests with ceramic plates and kevlar helmets. He had visited the Sejm and tested whether it is possible to use radio remote controls in the buildings for the purposes of planned detonation of the car bomb. Being a graduate of Warsaw University of Technology program on explosive manufacturing, Kwiecie\u0144 was conducting illegal trials of explosives from at least 2000. In some cases, he detonated small explosives on Warsaw bridges, making small dents and holes in their construction. Apart from targeting the parliament, Kwiecie\u0144 was also preparing murders of Monika Olejnik, an influential journalist, and Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, the mayor of Warsaw.\n\nKwiecie\u0144 intensified his preparations after Breivik's conviction. He conducted an experimental explosion of a  bomb in the Polish countryside in the municipality of Przeginia, which he also filmed. He had recruited four other people for his cause, however at least two of them were actually ABW's secret agents. He was convicted and sentenced to nine years of imprisonment on 19 April 2017. Brunon Kwiecie\u0144 died in prison on 6 August 2019 from what is believed to have been a suicide.\n\n===Embezzlement from terror attack victims fund===\nIn 2016, one person was sentenced to 120 days in prison for embezzling 300,000 Norwegian kroner from St\u00f8ttegruppen etter 22. juli, a Norwegian NGO; the money was supposed to have gone to victims of the terror attack. The perpetrator was a steward of the NGO.\n\n===Semi-automatic weapon ban for hunting and Mini-14 rifle ban===\nOn 28 February 2018, Peter Froelich of the Norwegian parliament's committee on judicial affairs, said a proposal to ban semi-automatic weapons proposed the year prior now had enough political support to become law by 2021. The law will ban Ruger Mini-14 rifle that was used in Ut\u00f8ya massacre and other semi-auto rifles for hunting. However, using semi-automatic firearms for shooting sports is still legal for sportsmen who have permission for practice and competition shooting from Dynamic Sports Shooting Norway (DSSN) or the Norwegian Reserve Officers' Association (NROF).\n\n===Christchurch mosque shootings===\n\nBrenton Harrison Tarrant, the perpetrator of two consecutive mass shootings at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, said in his manifesto The Great Replacement (in reference to a far-right theory from France by Renaud Camus) that he was in particular inspired by Breivik and claimed to have been in \"brief contact\" with him, as well as meeting with his organisation, the Knights Templar. The shootings took place at Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, during Friday Prayer on 15 March 2019, killing 51 people and injuring 49 more.\n\n==In popular culture==\n===Films===\nTwo films about the attacks were released in 2018: the Norwegian production Ut\u00f8ya: July 22, directed by Erik Poppe in Norwegian language and released in February, and the American production 22 July, directed by English filmmaker Paul Greengrass in English language (but with a Norwegian cast) and released in September. Despite their similar names and close release dates, they are unrelated.\n\nPoppe's film is a continuous shot feature film reenacting the Ut\u00f8ya massacre by focusing solely on the victims (particularly on one played by Andrea Berntzen), with Breivik only appearing briefly as a distant shadowy figure. All the characters are fictional, and the movie was filmed as one continuous take, as the purpose was to promote understanding of the victims as seen from their perspective.\n\nGreengrass' film is based on the non-fiction book One of Us: The Story of a Massacre in Norway \u2013 and Its Aftermath, and unlike Poppe's work depicts real-life individuals involved in the events, with Breivik (played by Anders Danielsen Lie) playing a central role. The movie depicts both attacks, while also focusing heavily on their aftermath, most notably Breivik's trial; in parallel, it also focuses on the story of Viljar Hanssen, one of the survivors of the Ut\u00f8ya massacre who was shot and barely survived, as he and his family try to cope with the trauma.\n\nBoth films were received positively by critics, with several media outlets studying their radically different approaches to the same subject.\n\n===Music===\nThe Austrian black metal band Harakiri for the Sky released a song titled, \"69 Dead Birds for Ut\u00f8ya\", on their 2014 album Aokigahara. One verse says: \"Everytime you think the most stupefying incident in this world already happened, There comes one more.\"\n\nDutch symphonic metal band Epica released a song entitled \"Internal Warfare\", on their 2012 album Requiem for the Indifferent. Singer Simone Simons stated in an interview that it was about the Anders Breivik attacks in Norway.\n\nA 2016 song performed by the Norwegian pop-rock band deLillos, \"Vi ser dere n\u00e5\" (\"We see you now\"), was written about the attacks; one verse says: \".. he set off a bomb, to go to an island, where he gunned down youth, as if it was fun\".\n\nEric Brazilian wrote and performed the hopeful song \"One Light\" in honor of the people of Norway after the tragedy. August 18, 2011. Video produced by Feedback. View on YouTube.\n\n===Television===\nSeason 6 of Seconds From Disaster premiered on the one-year anniversary of the 2011 Norway attacks (aired 22 July 2012), with the episode titled, \"Norway Massacre: I Was There\".\n\nThe Futurama episode The Cryonic Woman was briefly changed on some syndicated reruns, including the DVD re-release, because a moment in the episode included a screen saying \"Prime Minister of Norway\". This was later changed to \"Chainsaw Juggler\".\n\n==See also==\n* 22 July Information Center, the government enquiry into the attacks\n* Anders Behring Breivik in popular culture\n* Oklahoma City bombing, a lone wolf attack against government offices Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA, using similar explosives.\n* List of rampage killers (religious, political or racial crimes)\n\n==References==\n\n\n==Further reading==\n* Borchgrevink, Aage Storm, and Guy Puzey.

{"title":"2017 Xuzhou kindergarten bombing","article":"On 15 June 2017, a bombing at a kindergarten in Feng County, Xuzhou, Jiangsu province, east China, killed at least eight people and injured 65 others. The perpetrator, 22-year-old Xu Taoran, died in the blast. Subsequent investigation revealed that Xu was mentally ill and obsessed with death and destruction. The blast occurred at the entrance of the kindergarten, while children were leaving school. Two people died on the spot, and five succumbed to injuries at the hospital. Nine remained in critical condition in the aftermath. Due to the shattering bomb parts, over 60 people were injured and needed medical attention.\n\nThe Fengxian county government stated that the casualties did not include any of the kindergarten's children or teachers, as class had not yet been dismissed.\n\n== Motives ==\nThe suicide bomber responsible was identified as 22-year-old Xu Taoran, who suffered from \u201cvegetative nervous function disturbances,\u201d a disorder that can cause heart and breathing problems. Prior to the attack, he dropped out of school and went to work and lived near the kindergarten. After the attack, investigators found material to make a homemade explosive device and, written on a wall near the school, a \"manifesto-style rant.\" It has been suggested that the attack may have been targeted at mothers. Sociologist say \u201cthe attacks on schools and young children are a result of the strains of society undergoing rapid change.\u201d\n\n== Victims ==\nAfter the explosion, about fifty-nine adults and children survived with injuries. However, eight victims, including the bomber, died in the explosion. Authorities did not specify if there were any children included in the fatalities. Many people were in tears after the incident, and most of the victims, laying on the ground, had their clothes torn off because due to the blast.  The hospital did not respond to anyone\u2019s calls, and the condition of the injured victims remained unknown.\n\n== Investigation ==\nChinese investigators using physical evidence and DNA found at the scene to determine the identity of the suspect, which pointed to Xu Taoran, 22, a university dropout who had written violent screeds against parents and children. Taoran had antisocial tendencies and had a debilitating autonomous nervous system disorder that forced him to take a leave of absence from his school, authorities said. Due to China\u2019s gutted mental health care program, those who are poor and can\u2019t afford any care, such as Xu, are left to grapple with frustration. The police discovered the materials used to make the explosives in his apartment, along with words such as \"'die,' 'death' and 'destroy'\" written on the walls, assumingly pointed towards children and families.\n\n== Related events ==\nFrom 2010 to 2012, China saw at least nine attacks on elementary students, which together killed at least 25 people and wounded more than 100. Many of these attacks seem related to each other regarding how the schools security system were lacking and thorough background checks were not completed on the school personnel. Some of these attacks include:\n* In Weihai, on 9 May 2017, a school bus driver set fire to his bus in a tunnel after losing overtime pay, killing 11 children, a teacher and himself.\n* In HanzHong, May 2010, a 48 year old man charged into a kindergarten and killed 7 children and 2 adults with a cleaver. After committing this deranged act, the attacker went home and committed suicide.\n* In Nanping, a worker who had a history of mental illness stabbed 8 young children to death and wounded five other children outside an elementary school in eastern China\nThe events allowed school boards to make new decisions and new policies to keep children safe in schools to avoid such tragedies.\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/news\/archive\/2017\/06\/suspect-identified-in-bombing-of-chinese-kindergarten\/530700\/","https:\/\/apnews.com\/91c1cbd2bf9a41609e0ba857974c0cd9","http:\/\/www.straitstimes.com\/asia\/east-asia\/death-toll-in-chinese-kindergarten-blast-rises-to-8-65-injured","https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2017\/06\/16\/533244891\/a-bomber-was-behind-the-deadly-kindergarten-blast-chinese-police-say","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/china-police-blame-lone-bomber-for-killing-8-at-kindergarten-gate\/2017\/06\/16\/0a3d91b4-5269-11e7-a973-3dae94ed3eb7_story.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/06\/16\/world\/asia\/china-kindergarten-explosion-jiangsu-suspect.html","https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2017\/06\/16\/533244891\/a-bomber-was-behind-the-deadly-kindergarten-blast-chinese-police-say","https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/china-police-kindergarten-blast-was-caused-by-bomb-suspect-dead\/"]}
{"title":"2018 Bulawayo bombing","article":"On 23 June 2018, a grenade exploded at White City Stadium in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. The blast occurred at a ZANU\u2013PF campaign rally, just after President Emmerson Mnangagwa had finished giving a speech. It was described as an assassination attempt against Mnangagwa, who was unharmed. The bombing resulted in at least 49 injured, including Vice-Presidents Constantino Chiwenga and Kembo Mohadi, and other high-ranking government officials. Two security agents later died of their injuries.\n\nThe bombing was widely condemned in Zimbabwe and abroad by politicians of both ZANU\u2013PF and opposition parties, and by other public figures. In an interview with the BBC several days after the blast, Mnangagwa blamed the attack on former First Lady Grace Mugabe's G40 faction within ZANU\u2013PF, while stopping short of blaming Mugabe directly. On 27 June 2018, the Zimbabwe Defence Forces stated that they had arrested an individual on the day of the attack. Two more suspects were later arrested, but released without charges.\n\n== Background ==\nOn the evening of 14 November 2017, elements of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) gathered around Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, and seized control of the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation and key areas of the city. The next day, the ZDF issued a statement saying that it was not a coup d'\u00e9tat and that President Robert Mugabe was safe, although the situation would return to normal only after the ZDF had dealt with the \"criminals\" around Mugabe responsible for the socio-economic problems of Zimbabwe.\n\nThe uprising took place amid tensions in the ruling ZANU\u2013PF party between former First Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa (who was backed by the ZDF and the party's Lacoste faction) and First Lady Grace Mugabe (who was backed by the younger G40 faction) over who would succeed the 93-year-old President Mugabe. A week after Mnangagwa was fired and forced to flee the country, and a day before troops moved into Harare, Zimbabwe Defence Forces chief Constantino Chiwenga issued a statement that purges of senior ZANU\u2013PF officials like Mnangagwa had to stop. On 19 November, ZANU-PF removed Mugabe as party leader, replacing him with Mnangagwa. Mugabe resigned the presidency on 21 November 2017. Mnangagwa was sworn in as President on 24 November 2017.\n\n== Explosion ==\n\nOn the afternoon of Saturday, 23 June 2018, Zimbabwe's ruling party, ZANU\u2013PF, was holding a campaign rally at White City Stadium in Bulawayo, the country's second largest city and an opposition stronghold. The rally, which was attended by several thousand people, was held to garner support for the party ahead of the July general elections. It was Mnangagwa's first rally in Bulawayo, which the party has not won since the 2000 elections.\n\nThe blast occurred in afternoon, shortly after President Emmerson Mnangagwa had finished giving a speech. As Mnangagwa and other party leaders walked offstage to enter a VIP tent, a grenade exploded, creating a cloud of smoke and knocking over people standing close by. Mnangagwa, who was close to the blast but was unhurt, was rushed away by security personnel, while the crowds began running in all directions. Red Cross medics rushed in, treating and evacuating the wounded. State television immediately cut their broadcast after the blast.\n\n=== Casualties ===\nThe bombing injured 49 people, two of whom died two days later, on 25 June. The two deceased were Central Intelligence Organisation security personnel; Colour Sergeant Stanley Mugunzva of the Presidential Guard, who was assigned to Vice-President Chiwenga, and Nelson Dube, an aide to Vice-President Mohadi. A Zimbabwe Republic Police spokesperson state that while the number of injured was official recorded at 49, it could be larger if there were other victims who did not seek medical care. Four security personnel and several chiefs were injured in the blast. While most of the victims sustained minor injuries and were discharged within hours, health officials warned that some are still in critical condition and that the death toll could rise.\n\nAmong the injured were leading government and party officials. Constantino Chiwenga, the First Vice-President of Zimbabwe and a major figure in the 2017 coup, had minor injuries, as did his wife Marry, who sustained lacerations to her face while trying to rescue one of her aides who had shrapnel in her stomach. Second Vice-President Kembo Mohadi was also hospitalized with injuries to his legs. Oppah Muchinguri, the national chairperson of ZANU\u2013PF and the environmental minister, had one of her breasts ripped off by the blast and was in a state of shock. Deputy Speaker of the House of Assembly and ZANU\u2013PF Women's League leader Mabel Chinomona was also injured, as was ZANU\u2013PF National Political Commissar Engelbert Rugeje, who received shrapnel in his arm.\n\nConstantino and Marry Chiwenga, Mabel Chinomona, and Engelbert Rugeje were discharged in the days after the attack, while Kembo Mohadi and Oppah Muchinguri suffered more serious injuries and remained in treatment longer. On Tuesday, 26 June, Mohadi was airlifted to South Africa for treatment. Mohadi, whose legs were injured in the blast, was reported to be in stable condition, though physicians experienced difficulty treating his hypertension. On 27 June, Muchinguri was also flown to South Africa, where she underwent orthopedic and reconstructive surgery. Muchinguri required treatment to address her left breast, which was ripped off by the blast, as well as psychological care and counseling.\n\nVice-President Chiwenga chose to forgo immediate medical treatment so that he could fully participate in campaigning in the run-up to the 2018 elections. On 9 October 2018, Chiwenga and his wife flew to South Africa for medical treatment, where their injuries were reviewed. In addition to injuries sustained from the Bulawayo bombing, Chiwenga also had a bullet lodged in his leg from a separate incident. They remain in the hospital as of 15 October, although their medical review has been completed. Chiwenga remained in daily contact with President Mnangagwa and is expected to return to Zimbabwe later this week.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nImmediately after the blast, Mnangagwa was rushed away from the scene by his security personnel. His motorcade drove him to safety at the Bulawayo State House. Victims of the blast were evacuated to Mater Dei Hospital in Bulawayo, and Mnangagwa visited them there hours later. Later, the injured were moved to Manyame Air Base hospital in Harare.\n\nPresidential spokesman George Charamba told the state-owned Sunday Mail that the general elections scheduled for 30 July 2018 will be held as planned despite the blast, and said that a state of emergency would not be declared.\n\n=== Domestic reactions ===\nShortly after the bombing, the attack was widely denounced by politicians and other public figures in Zimbabwe, while the media, beginning with the state-run Herald newspaper, soon labeled the attack an assassination attempt against President Mnangagwa. In an interview with the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation hours after the blast, Mnangagwa called the attack \"cowardly\", offered his thoughts and prayers to the victims, and insisted that the violence would not prevent the upcoming elections from being held. He said that the attack occurred \"inches\" from him, but said \"it is not my time\", noting that after a number of previous attempts on his life, he was used to it. Without elaborating, he said the perpetrators must have come from \"outside Bulawayo\", adding \"I can assure you these are my normal enemies.\"\n\nThe attack was condemned by politicians of both ZANU\u2013PF and opposition parties. First Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga, who sustained minor injuries in the blast, called the attack an \"act of terror\" and echoed Mnangagwa, adding that the blast would not affect the elections. Foreign Minister Sibusiso Moyo and former Vice President Joice Mujuru called for peace. Opposition leader and MDC\u2013T presidential candidate Nelson Chamisa condemned the attack and urged the expunction of political violence in Zimbabwe. Other opposition politicians condemning the attack and offering condolences included former Finance Minister Tendai Biti, Senator David Coltart, MP Temba Mliswa, and lawyer and former MDC\u2013T official Alex Magaisa. Notable civilians who denounced the attack included author and filmmaker Tsitsi Dangarembga, musician Thomas Mapfumo, businessman and philanthropist Strive Masiyiwa and his wife, newspaper publisher Trevor Ncube, and exiled judge Ben Paradza. Exiled former ZANU\u2013PF government minister and G40 member Jonathan Moyo, who was expelled during the 2017 coup d'\u00e9tat, took a less sympathetic approach, comparing the blast to the November coup and tweeting \"Violence begets violence.\" Patrick Zhuwao, also an exiled G40 politician, urged British Prime Minister Theresa May to dispatch Scotland Yard to investigate the attack, citing the United States's deployment of Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel to investigate a bombing in Ethiopia that happened on the same day.\n\nSeveral days after the blast, several prominent ZANU\u2013PF members, including President Mnangagwa, claimed that the attack was an \"inside job\" by dissident ZANU\u2013PF members, and began directing blame towards members of the party's G40 faction. Prior to the 2017 coup, G40 was allied with former First Lady Grace Mugabe, who was Mnangagwa's rival to succeed her husband Robert Mugabe as President. On 26 June, a spokesman for the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association (ZNLWVA), a Rhodesian Bush War veterans' group allied with ZANU\u2013PF, told journalists that the ZNLWVA condemned the attack, demanded that police release more information, and argued \"the evil political machinations of G40... cannot be ruled out as suspects.\" Puparai Togarepi, secretary of the ZANU\u2013PF Youth League, told journalists in Harare that they also believed \"enemies surrounding Mnangagwa\" were responsibly for the bombing. An exiled former G40 member and cabinet minister, Jonathan Moyo, tweeted that the attack \"smacks of an inside job\".\n\nMnangagwa himself, in a 27 June interview with the BBC, said that he believed the G40 faction was responsible for the attack. Though he admitted this claim was a \"hunch without evidence\", he argued that it was \"the logical and reasonable conclusion\". Mnangagwa did direct blame at Grace Mugabe, who was in Singapore at the time of the blast, but said that she was \"politically immature and was easily used as a tool by those who wanted to get at me.\" The president added that concern about instability in Zimbabwe was unfounded and that the attack would not result in a security crackdown.\n\nAt a 27 June event, ZANU\u2013PF, the MDC\u2013T, and several other parties signed a peace pledge ahead of the July elections, promising to refrain from hate speech and violence. There, Minister of Home Affairs and Culture Obert Mpofu, whose son was injured by the blast, condemned the \"evil deed\" and urged Zimbabweans not to capitalize on the grief of victims and their families. Speaking at the same event, Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission chair Elasto Mugwadi denounced the attack, adding \"in protecting human rights, we all need to protect the sanctity of life.\" Mugwadi appealed to all political parties to avoid hate speech, \"provocative sloganeering\" and emotional appeals.\n\n=== International reactions ===\n\nThe bombing was widely denounced internationally. Via Twitter, the Harare embassies of Australia, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, as well as the European Union's European External Action Service all condemned the attack and offered thoughts and prayers to the victims. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa condemned the bombing, stating that acts of violence and criminality had no place in the democratic process. Ramaphosa, who is also chair of the Southern African Development Community, said that the SADC would evaluate the matter and \"take appropriate steps\". At the 43rd Plenary Assembly Session of the SADC Parliamentary Forum in Luanda, Angolan President Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o denounced the bombing as \"cowardly, criminal, and undemocratic\", adding that he saw the attacks in Bulawayo and Addis Ababa as efforts to undermine democratic elections in Zimbabwe and Ethiopia. The government of China also condemned the attack in a statement, adding that it hoped for continued stability and peaceful elections in Zimbabwe. Dewa Mavinhinga, Southern Africa director of Human Rights Watch, raised concerns that the bombing could trigger more political violence in an election year that, thus far, had been unmarred by the violence seen before previous elections. In a 29 June statement, former Botswana President Ian Khama condemned the bombing.\n\n== Investigations ==\n\nOn the day of the attack, the Zimbabwe Republic Police offered an unspecified reward for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrator of the bombing. A police spokesperson said that crime scene investigators were examining the matter. In the days after the attack, unverified details and explanations regarding the attack were reported. One source reported that an explosive was placed underneath the stage on which Mnangagwa was standing, while another source quoted a woman in attendance at the rally who claimed she saw a young child throw a \"package\" at the stage just prior to the explosion. According to the woman's claim, which is uncorroborated, the child approached the state and asked to read a poem in praise of Mnangagwa, and was held back by security personnel but pushed through them and threw something towards the stage.\n\nOn Wednesday, 27 June, 35 security and investigative personnel met in Harare to discuss the investigations. Later that day, police released new details about the perpetrator and details of the attack. After the blast, police interviewed witnesses, a number of whom reported that they saw the same man throw an object at the stage. Police described the suspect as a young male \"between the ages of 23 and 25\", about 1.7 meters tall and of dark complexion, who was wearing a yellow ZANU\u2013PF T-shirt at the time of the attack. Witnesses told police that the man lobbed an item towards the stage from about 30 to 35 meters away, but the item missed its target after hitting a rope and then bouncing off a security officer's cheek before landing and detonating. The suspect was allegedly \"fiddling around\" with the object before throwing it. After the blast, police and military went after him, but witnesses said they saw soldiers get to him first and arrest him, police reported. The suspect has not been seen since the military apprehended him in the townships outside White City Stadium.\n\nThe 27 June meeting highlighted rivalries between the Zimbabwe Defence Forces and the Zimbabwe Republic Police amidst the ongoing investigations. Presidential spokesman George Charamba noted that \"unresolved leadership issues\" were affecting investigations. These internal conflicts within ZANU\u2013PF and between different security forces were paralleled by alleged tensions between President Mnangagwa and Vice-President Chiwenga, the former Commander of the Defence Forces and a major figure in the 2017 coup.\n\nInternal rivalries between Zimbabwean security forces were exacerbated, not alleviated, by the military's arrest of the alleged perpetrator. The military had not responded to the Zimbabwe Republic Police's requests for confirmation of the suspect's detainment, nor to police requests for their Criminal Investigations Department to interview the suspect. Police officials told the Zimbabwe Independent that although they had found some good leads through witness interviews, they lack access to the suspect, so the investigations cannot \"proceed properly.\" Currently, investigative units from the military, the police's Criminal Investigation Department, and the Central Intelligence Organisation are based in Bulawayo to investigate the attack. Current investigations lack coordination between the three groups, and there was even conflict over hotel accommodations for investigators.\n\nPolice investigations concluded that the perpetrator must have been someone with some security background and training, and experience handling weapons. Police said that the way the grenade was handled and launched indicated at least basic security training. Police are currently investigating the source of the explosive, which they say could not have come from police, as they no longer use grenades since the November 2017 coup. Weapons experts are analyzing the debris from the explosion to determine what type of grenade was used and where it might have come from. Police say that their inability to question the suspect, who is in military custody, prevents them from asking about the weapon and its origin, and the suspect's motive. They said they thought he may have been a hired hitman.\n\nInvestigations show that President Mnangagwa was the likely target of the attack, though investigators have not yet determined with certainty that it was an assassination attempt. Investigators and government officials told the Zimbabwe Independent that had the grenade not deflected off a rope, it likely would have detonated within a fatal distance of Mnangagwa. In a 27 June interview, Mnangagwa stated that he expected arrests to be made soon.\n\nTwo suspects, residents of Bulawayo's Pumula suburb, reportedly appeared before a magistrate at the Tredgold Magistrates' Court in Bulawayo to answer charges regarding the 23 June bombing. The suspects were identified as John Zulu and Douglas Musekiwa, and it is unclear is one of these men was the suspect arrested by the military the day of the attack. Zulu and Musekiwa were later released without charges.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* List of terrorist incidents in June 2018\n\n== References ==\n\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n*  Video of the explosion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBulawayo, where the blast occurred.\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa, shown here speaking at a 2015 rally, was the target of the attack.\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the Southern Africa Development Community, of which he is the chair, would evaluate the matter.\nThe Zimbabwe National Army, along with the Zimbabwe Republic Police, clashed during investigations.","urls":["https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/zimbabwes-president-narrowly-escapes-apparent-assassination-attempt\/2018\/06\/23\/fd20ab56-76ed-11e8-bda1-18e53a448a14_story.html","https:\/\/www.herald.co.zw\/breaking-news-attempt-on-eds-life\/","http:\/\/www.thezimbabwemail.com\/zimbabwe\/8-injured-in-assassination-plot-on-zimbabwes-president\/","http:\/\/www.africanews.com\/2018\/06\/24\/zimbabwe-police-says-49-people-injured-in-bulawayo-blast\/","http:\/\/ewn.co.za\/2018\/06\/23\/zimbabwe-s-president-unhurt-after-cowardly-blast-at-rally","http:\/\/ewn.co.za\/2018\/06\/25\/2-die-following-explosion-at-mnangagwa-rally-in-bulawayo","https:\/\/www.newsday.co.zw\/2018\/06\/explosion-an-inside-job-zanu-pf\/","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2018\/jun\/27\/zimbabwe-president-blames-rally-attack-grace-mugabe-g40-faction","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2017\/nov\/14\/tensions-rise-in-zimbabwe-as-military-drives-through-outskirts-of-capital","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2017\/nov\/13\/zimbabwe-army-chief-warns-military-could-step-in-over-party-purge","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-africa-42071488","https:\/\/www.rte.ie\/news\/world\/2017\/1124\/922496-zimbabwe\/","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-africa-44586218","https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/world\/blast-zimbabwe-rally-called-assassination-attempt-president-mnangagwa-n886026","http:\/\/www.africanews.com\/2018\/06\/24\/zimbabwe-rules-out-state-of-emergency-after-bulawayo-blast\/\/","https:\/\/www.newsday.co.zw\/2018\/06\/mnangagwa-bombing-claim-a-life\/","https:\/\/www.dailynews.co.zw\/articles\/2018\/06\/29\/bulawayo-bombing-minister-loses-breast","http:\/\/www.africanews.com\/2018\/06\/24\/zimbabwe-police-says-49-people-injured-in-bulawayo-blast\/","https:\/\/bulawayo24.com\/index-id-news-sc-national-byo-138717.html","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-zimbabwe-chiwenga\/zimbabwe-vice-president-says-saturdays-explosion-was-act-of-terrorism-idUSKBN1JK0NP","https:\/\/www.chronicle.co.zw\/vp-in-good-health\/","https:\/\/news.pindula.co.zw\/2018\/06\/24\/politicians-notable-people-react-to-bulawayo-explosion-at-mnangagwa-rally\/","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-africa-44619102","https:\/\/bulawayo24.com\/index-id-news-sc-national-byo-138758.html","https:\/\/bulawayo24.com\/index-id-news-sc-national-byo-139196.html","https:\/\/www.news24.com\/Africa\/Zimbabwe\/latest-us-britain-condemn-attack-at-zimbabwe-rally-20180624","https:\/\/twitter.com\/AusEmbZim","https:\/\/twitter.com\/NLinZimbabwe","https:\/\/www.news24.com\/Africa\/Zimbabwe\/ramaphosa-sadc-to-evaluate-zim-rally-blast-and-take-appropriate-steps-20180624","https:\/\/www.herald.co.zw\/khama-slams-byo-bombing\/","https:\/\/www.news24.com\/Africa\/Zimbabwe\/exclusive-zim-bomb-explosion-is-the-start-of-a-general-trend-of-violence-ahead-of-elections-20180626","https:\/\/www.zimbabwesituation.com\/news\/woman-claims-child-threw-package-at-rally\/","https:\/\/bulawayo24.com\/index-id-news-sc-national-byo-139207.html","https:\/\/zwnews.com\/identified-john-zulu-and-douglas-from-pumula-byo-bomb-suspects-pictures-appear-court\/","https:\/\/news.pindula.co.zw\/2018\/07\/09\/mnangagwa-rally-bombers-will-be-arrested-says-chiwenga-despite-two-being-arrested-and-released\/"]}
{"title":"2019 Bangkok bombings","article":"On 2 August 2019, series of small bombs have detonated over five locations throughout Bangkok Metropolitan Area. The blasts location included Chong Nonsi BTS Station, near the King Power Mahanakhon tower, the Chaengwattana Government Complex, the Royal Thai Armed Forces Headquarters, and inside a branch of Miniso; a utility goods store at Siam Square One. The blasts have resulted in total of seven injuries.\n\nThe initial investigation carried out by Thai police has reported that the suspect of the insurgent is related to the same group that has carried out similar attack during 2016. The bombings also coincided with an ASEAN summit that was taking place in the city.\n\n== Attack ==\nOn 2 August 2019, at 04:45 Bangkok time (UTC+7.00), a minor bomb detonated at a branch of Miniso, a utility goods store, in Siam Square One shopping center, Pathum Wan District. The bomb was stuffed inside a doll from the We Bare Bears cartoon series. The shelves and goods in the store were damaged, no one was injured as the store was not yet opened. The security camera later revealed that the bomb was planted by a masked man covered in sunglasses the day before. The store remained closed for two days for maintenance on damaged shelves.\n\nAt 07:00 local time, four bombs at the Chaengwattana Government Complex has been reported to the local police station. The first two bombs has detonated in front of the entrance of the Government complex, while followed by the third bomb that has exploded in front of the Royal Thai Armed Forces Headquarters.

Many false positive suspect of bombing device has been reported after the first 3 incidents.\n\nThe ASEAN summit was not disrupted.\n\n== Investigation ==\nThe initial investigation reported by Intelligence Agencies reported that this attacked could potentially be linked to an expansion of operations by the insurgents that were supported by the opposition leader of the government. However, the Royal Thai police lead by the police chief Chakthip Chaijinda reported that this incident is perpetrated by the same group of insurgents that has carried out similar attacked in seven southern district in 2016.\n\nThe explosive devices reported by the Royal Thai Police was believed to be a homemade bomb that has a size of a tennis ball. Although the motives of this attack remain unknown, however it is appears to been an attack on the country's image as Bangkok hosted an ASEAN summit, where political leader from each southeast asian nation have attended the summit, while also other nation representatives, such as the UK foreign secretary, US secretary of State, and China's Diplomat.\n\nThe Royal Thai Police has ordered the Crime Suppression Division (CSD) to further investigate the attacks that happened on the 2 August. The Crime Suppression Division has work closely with the Office of the Attorney-General (OAG) to gather intelligence and evidence on the attacks and has reported that the attacks was planned near the Thai-Malaysian border.\n\nOn 5 August, the Royal Thai Police has published a report regarding the attack, the attack was orchestrated by group of 15 people, where the evidence was drawn from inquiry of the 2 suspects that were arrested on the 2nd of August. While the inquiry, the police has examine the blasting site, and has gathered CCTV evidence and fingerprint and DNA sample from the site.

The DNA and fingerprint samples have been collected by the Forensic Science Police officers to cross check with the sample that was collected at the blasting site.\n\nBy the 4th of September the Criminal Court has issued in total of 14 arrest warrants and has arrested in total of 3 suspects.\n\n== Reaction ==\nThe military junta leader Prayut Chan-o-cha respond to this attack by condemning to those who planned the attack and has destroyed the peace and order to the country. While the Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan has told the reporter that the insurgent was orchestrated to create a situation to embarrassed the government as the city hosted ASEAN summit.\n\nChief Police Chaktip Chaijinda also believe that the motives behind the attack was believed to be political related, as Thailand held its first general election in March since the 2014 Thai coup d'\u00e9tat. Nonetheless, many government opposition believe that this attacks was responsible by the government itself in order to divert the public attention on the current poor public image of the government.\n\n== Other arrests, detentions, and prosecutions ==\nOn August 2, two suspect were arrested in front of the Royal Thai Police headquarters, and sent to temporary confinement.

{"title":"2017 New York City attempted bombing","article":"On December 11, 2017, a pipe bomb partially detonated in the subway station adjoining the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, injuring four people including the suspect. Mayor Bill de Blasio described the incident as \"an attempted terrorist attack\". The suspected bomber was identified by police as 27-year-old Akayed Ullah, a Salafi Muslim immigrant from Bangladesh.\n\n==Events==\nAt approximately 7:20\u00a0a.m., during morning rush hour, a pipe bomb partially detonated in the New York City Subway's Times Square\u201342nd Street\/Port Authority Bus Terminal station, within the underground passageway between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. The suspected bomber was taken to Bellevue Hospital for treatment. There were four non-life-threatening injuries. According to the city's fire department commissioner, the suspect suffered burns to his hands and torso while three bystanders had \"ringing ears and headaches\". The bombing severely disrupted subway service for several hours, leading to a slight decline in ridership.\n\n== Perpetrator ==\nAfter the incident, the Port Authority Police Department (PAPD) arrested a \"would-be suicide bomber\" armed with a pipe bomb (which was filled with sugar and Christmas tree lights) and a battery pack. The suspect was identified as 27-year-old Brooklyn resident Akayed Ullah.\n\nOne year after he arrived in the US, his father died. He subsequently converted to Salafism and pressured his family to pray regularly and adopt conservative religious beliefs. Ullah's wife and child live in Bangladesh, where he kept books by Muhammad Jasimuddin Rahmani, the spiritual leader of extremist group Ansarullah Bangla Team which is linked to the terror group al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent. Ullah wrote handwritten notes on his passport, including \u201cO AMERICA, DIE IN YOUR RAGE.\u201d  He was a licensed cab driver from March 2012 to March 2015. He had posted a warning on Facebook, \"Trump you failed to protect your nation\", before the attack. Prosecutors allege he told police after the blast \"I did it for the Islamic State.\"\n\nAfter being questioned, Ullah reportedly said he was \"following ISIS on the internet and reading Inspire magazine\". Through online instructions, he learned how to make the explosive device. A law enforcement source told CNN that Ullah said he carried out the attack in response to recent Israeli actions in Gaza over Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\n\nThe Associated Press, however, reported law enforcement sources told them he was retaliating against U.S. military aggression. Authorities believed he also sought reprisal for American air attacks on Muslims in Syria and elsewhere. According to statements by law enforcement officials, reported in The New York Times, he chose the Times Square area because of its Christmas-themed advertising. During court proceedings, Ullah denied being an ISIS sympathizer, saying he \"was angry with Donald Trump because he said he will bomb the Middle East and protect his nation.\"\n\nUllah had at times frequented the Masjid Nur Al Islam, a mosque in Kensington, Brooklyn, which was placed on the NYPD Intelligence Division's \"Mosques of Interest\" list in 2004. Four members of the mosque are also on the NYPD's \"Most Dangerous\" list.\n\nUllah is a permanent U.S. resident. His uncle won a diversity visa lottery which enabled him to bring Ullah to the United States under the family reunification provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.\n\n==Legal proceedings==\nUllah was charged with possessing a criminal weapon, making terroristic threats and supporting an act of terrorism. In early November 2018, he was found guilty on all counts.  He was sentenced on April 5, 2019 to life imprisonment without parole. Ullah is currently incarcerated in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York.\n\n==Reaction==\nPresident Donald Trump said, \"There have now been two terrorist attacks in New York City in recent weeks carried out by foreign nationals here on green cards. The first attacker came through the visa lottery, the second came through chain migration. We\u2019re going to end both of them.\" He called for the end of the Diversity Immigrant Visa and chain migration after this attack, and had made a similar statement following the October 31, 2017, truck attack in Lower Manhattan.\n\nThe Bangladeshi consulate in New York City condemned the attack and reiterated the Bangladeshi government policy of zero tolerance against terrorism. Bangladeshi-Americans in New York City denounced the attack, as well as President Trump's suggestion to end chain migration. Bangladesh's Counterterrorism Police stated that they did not find a link between Ullah and domestic terrorist groups in Bangladesh. The counterterrorism police also said that they had placed his family members under surveillance after the attack.\n\n==See also==\n* List of terrorist incidents in December 2017\n* List of terrorist incidents in New York City\n* United States recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/nypost.com\/2017\/12\/11\/explosion-reported-at-port-authority-bus-terminal\/","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/12\/11\/nyregion\/explosion-times-square.html","https:\/\/www.msn.com\/en-au\/news\/other\/four-injured-including-attacker-in-nyc-subway-bombing\/vp-BBGCIWJ","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2017\/dec\/11\/new-york-police-explosion-reports-manhattan","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/the_americas\/bangladesh-accused-nyc-attacker-followed-radical-preacher\/2017\/12\/13\/aa87ab16-dfd4-11e7-b2e9-8c636f076c76_story.html?tid=a_inl","http:\/\/web.mta.info\/mta\/news\/books\/pdf\/180220_1000_Transit.pdf","https:\/\/nypost.com\/2017\/12\/11\/port-authority-bomb-was-made-of-christmas-lights-sugar-and-a-battery-cops\/","http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/12\/11\/us\/manhattan-new-york-explosion-latest\/index.html","https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2017\/12\/11\/569838295\/explosion-reported-in-new-york-city-triggering-evacuations-in-subway","http:\/\/www.dhakatribune.com\/bangladesh\/2017\/12\/13\/akayed-started-changing-fathers-death\/","https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/bangladesh-police-ny-bomber-read-extremists-books-084243697.html","https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/world\/us\/new-york-bomber-read-extremists-books-urged-wife-to-do-so\/articleshow\/62055406.cms","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-us-canada-42327359","https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2017\/12\/13\/us\/port-authority-bombing-suspect-akayed-ullah\/index.html","https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/us-news\/akayed-ullah-nyc-explosion-suspect-identified-27-year-old-brooklyn-n828361","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-newyork-incident\/investigators-search-for-clues-in-attempted-new-york-subway-bombing-idUSKBN1E61H6","http:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/new-york\/nypd-fbi-swarm-brooklyn-home-suspect-port-authority-attack-article-1.3691267","https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/12\/11\/us\/ny-suspect-what-we-know\/index.html","https:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/us-news\/1.828402","http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/12\/11\/us\/new-york-possible-explosion-port-authority-subway\/index.html","https:\/\/www.apnews.com\/ec1f7c0078fd427699a96d4889939856","https:\/\/nypost.com\/2017\/12\/11\/suicide-bombing-suspect-was-a-cab-driver-bent-on-revenge-cops\/","https:\/\/slate.com\/news-and-politics\/2017\/12\/the-new-york-bombing-suspect-has-been-charged-with-supporting-an-act-of-terrorism.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/12\/11\/nyregion\/explosion-times-square.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/12\/12\/nyregion\/subway-bombing-akayed-ullah-bangladesh.html?_r=0","http:\/\/time.com\/5058505\/new-york-bomb-attack-suspect\/","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/12\/12\/nyregion\/bombing-suspects-visas-trump-end-immigration.html","https:\/\/m.washingtontimes.com\/news\/2017\/dec\/12\/akayed-ullah-vindicates-trump-immigration-policy\/","http:\/\/www.dhakatribune.com\/world\/north-america\/2017\/12\/13\/official-akayed-ullah-came-us-visa-sponsored-uncle\/","https:\/\/slate.com\/news-and-politics\/2017\/12\/the-new-york-bombing-suspect-has-been-charged-with-supporting-an-act-of-terrorism.html","http:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/new-york\/ny-metro-akayed-ullah-verdict-20181106-story.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/11\/06\/nyregion\/port-authority-bombing-verdict.html","https:\/\/www.bop.gov\/inmateloc\/<\/ref>","https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/world\/us\/after-nyc-subway-bombing-trump-slams-chain-migration\/articleshow\/62036360.cms","https:\/\/www.nbcnewyork.com\/news\/local\/President-Trump-Chain-Migration-Port-Authority-Bus-Terminal-Bombing-Explosion-463482233.html","https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/news\/international\/world-news\/trump-renews-calls-to-end-visa-lottery-chain-migration-after-ny-attack\/articleshow\/62045114.cms","http:\/\/www.thedailystar.net\/world\/us\/bangladesh-strongly-condemns-new-york-subway-blast-akayed-ullah-terrorism-1503775","https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/US\/wireStory\/bangladeshis-worry-pay-price-nyc-subway-bomb-51831732","http:\/\/www.thedailystar.net\/new-york-blast\/accused-new-york-bomber-akayed-ullah-family-says-attack-our-worst-nightmare-1504864"]}
{"title":"Parsons Green train bombing","article":"On 15 September 2017, at around 08:20 BST (07:20 UTC), an explosion occurred on a District line train at Parsons Green Underground station, in London, England. Thirty people were treated in hospital or an urgent care centre, mostly for burn injuries, by a botched crude 'bucket bomb' with a timer containing the TATP explosive chemical. Police arrested the main suspect, 18-year-old Iraqi asylum seeker Ahmed Hassan in a departure area of the Port of Dover the next day, and subsequently raided several addresses including the foster home of an elderly couple in Sunbury-on-Thames where Hassan had lived.\n\nHassan arrived in the UK illegally in October 2015 and had said that he had been compelled to undergo training by ISIL with about 1,000 other young people and he had feared members of his family would be killed if he had attempted to resist. The incident was classified by Europol as a case of jihadist terrorism. On 6 April 2019 it was announced that Lt. Col. Craig Palmer, a British Army officer who was that morning a passenger on the affected tube train, had been awarded the Queen's Commendation for Bravery for his part in helping to bring the bomber to trial and conviction.\n\n==Background==\nFour other attacks occurred in England in the months preceding the bombing: the Westminster attack, the Manchester Arena bombing, the London Bridge attack and the Finsbury Park attack. According to the BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani, along with the Parsons Green train bombing and police having foiled at least seven 'significant plots', this makes it \"the most sustained period of terror activity in England since the IRA bombing campaign of the 1970s.\"\n\n==Incident==\n\nA homemade bomb partially exploded on an eastbound District line train at Parsons Green Underground station, in West London. The District line train was packed with commuters and school children. Witnesses described seeing a fireball in the rear carriage of the packed rush-hour train. Numerous passengers were reported to have suffered flash burns. Others received crush injuries in the rush to leave the scene. Thirty people received medical treatment for their injuries, 19 of whom were taken to hospital by ambulance and the remainder self-presenting at hospital.\n\nThe device had been left in a white plastic bucket inside a shopping bag. Wires were hanging out, as well as a black towel. Reports also indicate the device had a timer attached and was packed with knives and screws. According to Ben Wallace, the security minister, the bomb contained the triacetone triperoxide explosive (TATP), the same explosive used in the 2005 London Underground bombings and the November 2015 Paris attacks. The explosive is known to be very unstable, which may have led to critical errors in the construction of the bomb, such that it only partially exploded. According to Chip Chapman, former head of counter-terrorism at the Ministry of Defence, \"This absolutely didn't function properly because\u2026  of TATP is enough to blow car doors off\".\n\n===Claim of responsibility===\nAccording to the Amaq News Agency, an affiliated unit of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant carried out the attack. The Metropolitan Police described the claim as \"very routine in these sort of circumstances\u2026 whether or not they have had any previous engagement with the individuals involved\". On 17 September, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said there was no evidence to suggest that ISIL was behind the attack, and added that  they would find out how the attacker was radicalised if they could.\n\n==Investigation and trial==\nThe Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command led the investigation into the attack. According to the Metropolitan Police, \u201chundreds of detectives\u201d are involved in the investigation. Investigators reportedly linked the attack to Islamic extremism and considered feasible a network of individuals involved in such plans. The Metropolitan Police launched a manhunt for one, possibly two, suspects.\n\nOn 16 September, Kent Police arrested Ahmed Hassan at the Port of Dover on suspicion of a terror offence. The port area was partially evacuated and a number of items recovered by the police. Later that day, police raided, and searched a house in Sunbury, Surrey. Hassan was not named initially, but was identified by media reports as an 18-year-old Iraqi orphan refugee who had been referred to a governmental anti-extremist programme.\n\nSeven men were arrested in total during the investigations. Later on 16 September, a man was arrested in Hounslow, west London, A third man, a 25-year-old, was arrested in Newport, south Wales, on 19 September and an address in Newport was searched. The seventh and final arrest took place on 25 September in Cardiff. On 21 September the second arrestee was released without charge.\n\nOn 22 September, Hassan was charged with attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life or cause serious injury. He appeared in court the following day and was remanded in custody, to appear at the Old Bailey on 13 October. The other six arrestees were released without charge.\n\nAhmed Hassan pleaded not guilty to the charges. His trial took place on 5\u201316 March 2018 at the Old Bailey. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) indicated that Hassan had not conveyed his motive for the attack and that, perhaps due to his destruction of electronic devices, there was no evidence of ISIS being an inspiration. On 16 March, he was found guilty by a unanimous jury. On 23 March, he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 34 years; he will be eligible for parole on 23 March 2052. The sentence reflected the court's belief that Hassan had lied about his age and was in fact older. It has been claimed, in an article by Lizzie Dearden of The Independent, that the police missed or misinterpreted evidence indicating Hassan was inspired by ISIS.\n\n== The bomber ==\nAhmed Hassan arrived in the UK in late 2015 claiming to be under 18, at a time when the UK government had shortly before instituted more generous rules on accepting asylum applications from unaccompanied minors. At a January 2016 immigration interview, Hassan told officials he had been in touch with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and been trained to kill. Hassan also stated during the interview that he blamed the United Kingdom for his father having died in Iraq. While his asylum application was being processed, he was placed in foster care with a highly experienced elderly foster couple who were given no hint of his extremist links.\n\n==Reactions==\n=== Domestic ===\nIn a statement after the incident, the Prime Minister, Theresa May, said: \"My thoughts are with those injured at Parsons Green and the emergency services who, once again, are responding swiftly and bravely to a suspected terrorist incident\".\n \nMayor of London Sadiq Khan said: \"As London has proven again and again, we will never be intimidated or defeated by terrorism. I am in close contact with the Metropolitan Police, Transport for London (TfL), Government and other emergency services who are responding at the scene and leading the investigation. I will be attending the emergency COBRA meeting in Whitehall this afternoon with the Prime Minister. My sincere gratitude goes to all our courageous emergency responders and the TfL staff who were first on the scene. I urge all Londoners to remain calm and vigilant\".  Khan also said: \"I am not going to apologise for saying we need more resources and more police in London\".\n\nSubsequent to the attack, the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre decided to raise the terror threat level from 'Severe' to 'Critical', for only the fourth time since its 2006 introduction. Operation Temperer was also activated for the second time, as a result of the raise in threat level. The terror threat level was then returned to 'Severe' by JTAC on 17 September 2017.\n\nCiting the Parsons Green train bombing, police advised the public not to record terrorist events, but instead to \"run, hide, tell\".\n\n=== International ===\nUS President Donald Trump tweeted: \"Another attack in London by a loser terrorist. These are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be proactive!\" He also touted his proposed travel ban. His comments were described by Theresa May, who characterised the tweets as inaccurate speculation, as \"not helpful.\"\n\n=== Craig Palmer bravery award===\nOn 6 April 2019 it was announced that Lt. Col. Craig Palmer, a passenger on the affected tube train, had been awarded the Queen's Commendation for Bravery for his part in helping to bring the bomber to trial and conviction. Despite great risk to himself, the Artillery officer, who was two carriages away as the train entered Parsons Green station, went towards the scene of the bomb and recognised it for it was. He took pictures that were able to be used in evidence at the subsequent trial of the bomber.\n\n==See also==\n\n*7 July 2005 London bombings\n*21 July 2005 London bombings\n*Cannon Street train

{"title":"2010 Varanasi bombing","article":"The 2010 Varanasi bombing was a blast that occurred on 7 December 2010, in one of the holiest Hindu cities, Varanasi. The explosion occurred at Sheetla Ghat, adjacent to the main Dashashwamedh Ghat, where the sunset aarti, the evening prayer ritual to the holy river, Ganges had commenced, on these stone steps leading to it, where thousands of worshipers and tourists had gathered. It killed a two-year-old girl, sitting on her mother's lap, the mother was one of three critically injured, more than 38 other people were injured. In the ensuing panic after the blast, a railing broke causing a stampede leading to an increase in the number of injuries. The bomb was hidden inside a milk container on the Sheetla Ghat. The blast occurred a day after the anniversary of the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition, in which a mosque was demolished at Ayodhya leading to nationwide religious riots killing over 2,000 people. Subsequently, the Islamist militant group, Indian Mujahideen, claimed responsibility of the blast, via email to Indian media. This is also the second terrorism-related incident in the city which was rocked by the serial blasts of 2006, in which 28 people were killed, it included an explosion at the Sankatmochan Temple, some two kilometres away.\n\nSitala Ghat is the southern extension of the Dashashwamedh Ghat, and its stone steps lead to Sitala Mata Temple. Also close by is the historic Kashi Vishwanath Temple, the Shiva temple which has one of the 12 Jyotirlinga of India. The present ghat was re-furbished in c. 1740 by Pt. Narayana Diksit the preceptor of Peshwa Baji Rao I, the Prime Minister of the Maratha Empire.\n\n\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nAfter the incident 20 injured were admitted to BHU Hospital, 13 in Kabir Chaura Hospital, while 4 were sent to Heritage Hospital in the city.  Six foreigners tourist were also injured including an Italian, Alessandro Mantelli, who was later said to be out of danger, French national Rachael, Ki Taro from Japan, South Korean Wan Sen Kim, Italian Livio DiMajo and a German citizen, Ozel. The death of the Italian tourist was wrongly reported in some media agencies, while he was recuperating in a city hospital.\n\nThe responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Pakistan-based Islamist militant group, Indian Mujahideen, via email. In an email, dated 6 December, which was traced to WiFi connections in the Vashi suburb in Navi Mumbai by the Mumbai Police, the Indian Mujahideen claimed that had carried out the blast as a revenge for the supposedly \"biased\" Babri Masjid verdict of 30 September 2010.\n\nThe bomb blast occurred at one of the steps of the Sitala ghat leading to the famous Sheetla Devi temple, which was surrounded by devotees and foreign tourists. After the incident the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Mayawati and Union Minister of Home Affairs P. Chidambaram visited the site, and appealed for peace. A national security alert was sounded and police intensified patrols in major cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore. Elsewhere in Hyderabad and Cyberabad the intelligence alerted local police on possible attacks on Dutch nationals in the city, after intercepting SMSs opposing the anti-Islam Dutch film Fitna (Devilry) by Dutch politician Geert Wilders.\n\nOn 11 December, a 50-year-old woman, visiting the town to watch the Ganga Aarti on the Dasashwamedh Ghat, succumbed to her injuries at a local hospital.\n\n==Investigations==\nThe following day, Mumbai Police investigations showed that Pakistan-based Bhatkal brothers, Riyaz and Iqbal, the chiefs of the Indian Mujahideen (IM) being the brains behind the explosion, which was carried out by Dr Shahnawaz presently based both in Dubai and Pakistan. He is the brother of IM foot soldier Mohammed Saif, who was arrested in the Batla House encounter on 19 September 2008 in which IM commander Atiq Amin was killed, while Dr Shahnawaz along with Khalid, Abu Rashid and Bada Sajid or Mohammed Sajid had fled to Nepal and now hold Nepalese passports.\n\nOn 8 December, three people, two amongst them identified as Shahnawaz and Assadullah (arrested by NIA August 2010 in Indo-Nepal Border), were arrested by the Uttar Pradesh state Anti Terror squad (ATS), and as per ATS sources they are linked to the 2008 Delhi serial blasts and also the Batla House encounter, which also occurred in 2008. The arrests suggested the revival of the Indian Mujahiddin terror outfit, which was dormant after the last encounter in 2008, a fact that is worrisome both for the state as well as the central government. The group however was previously suspected to be involved in the September 2010 Jama Masjid attack, in which two tourists were wounded in a machine gun attack, just before the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi.\n\nIn the subsequent investigations at the site, which was cordoned off soon after the incident and screened by the investigating agencies, improvised explosive device (IED) was recovered from a metal dustbin, though no residue of the explosives, remains of any circuit or detonator were found, the device did not have shrapnel in it, thus there were no burn or shrapnel injuries, and all the injured were hit by pieces of wall that broke following the explosion, all suggesting the use of plastique explosive, PETN, TNT or C4. Early results revealed used of Semtex, a general-purpose plastic explosive containing RDX and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN); however, the final report of the Forensic Science Institute, Gujarat is awaited.\n\nA writer for The Diplomat suggested that the blast not having occurred on the anniversary of Babri Mosque destruction on 6 December, and the shoddy design of the attack, were indicative of the weakening of the Indian Mujahideen due to police action.\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n*  Photo Gallery.
