{"title":"McGurk's Bar bombing","article":"On 4 December 1971, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), an Ulster loyalist paramilitary group, detonated a bomb at McGurk's Bar in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The pub was frequented by Irish Catholics\/nationalists. The explosion caused the building to collapse, killing fifteen Catholic civilians\u2014including two children\u2014and wounding seventeen more. It was the deadliest attack in Belfast during the Troubles.\n\nDespite evidence to the contrary, the British security forces asserted that a bomb had exploded prematurely while being handled by Irish Republican Army (IRA) members inside the pub, implying that the victims themselves were partly to blame. A report later found that the police (Royal Ulster Constabulary) were biased in favour of this view, and that this hindered their investigation. The victims' relatives allege that the security forces deliberately spread disinformation to discredit the IRA. In 1977, UVF member Robert Campbell was sentenced to life imprisonment for his part in the bombing and served fifteen years.\n\nThe bombing sparked a series of tit-for-tat bombings and shootings by loyalists and republicans, which contributed to making 1972 the bloodiest year of the conflict.\n\n==Background==\n\nMcGurk's (also called the Tramore Bar) was a two-storey public house on the corner of North Queen Street and Great George's Street, in the New Lodge area to the north of Belfast city centre. This was a mainly Irish nationalist and Catholic neighbourhood, and the pub's regular customers were from the community. The pub was owned by Patrick and Philomena McGurk, who lived on the upper floor with their four children.\n\nThe Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) was formed in Belfast in 1966, declaring \"war\" on the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Until 1971, however, its actions were few and it \"scarcely existed in an organisational sense\". The British Army was deployed in Northern Ireland following the August 1969 riots, which are usually seen as the start of the Troubles. In December 1969 the IRA split into two factions: the 'Official' IRA and Provisional IRA. Both launched armed campaigns against the British Army, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the government of Northern Ireland.\n\nDuring 1971, the violence gradually worsened. There were daily bombings and shootings by republicans, loyalists and the security forces. During the first two weeks of December, there were about 70 bombings and about 30 people were killed. On 2 December, three republican prisoners escaped from Crumlin Road prison, not far from McGurk's. Security was tightened and there was a heavy RUC and British Army presence in the area over the next two days. Eyewitnesses asserted that the checkpoints around McGurk's were removed just an hour before the attack.\n\n==Bombing==\n\n\nOn the evening of Saturday 4 December 1971, a four-man UVF team met in the Shankill area of Belfast and were ordered to bomb a pub on North Queen Street. According to the only convicted bomber\u2014Robert Campbell\u2014they were told not to return until the job was done. Campbell said that their target had not been McGurk's, but another pub nearby. It is believed this was a pub called The Gem, which was allegedly linked to the Official IRA. The  bomb was disguised as a brown parcel, which they placed in a car and drove to their target. Campbell says they stopped near The Gem at about 7:30pm, but could not gain access to it because there were security guards outside. After waiting for almost an hour, they drove a short distance to McGurk's. At about 8:45pm, one of them placed the bomb in the porch entrance on Great George's Street and rushed back to the car. It exploded just moments after they drove off. Campbell implied that McGurk's had been chosen only because it was \"the nearest Catholic pub\".\n\nThe blast caused the building to collapse. Bystanders immediately rushed to free the dead and wounded from the rubble. Firefighters, paramedics, police and soldiers were quickly on the scene. Fifteen Catholic civilians had been killed\u2014including two children\u2014and a further seventeen wounded. The rescue effort lasted many hours.\n\nWithin two hours of the blast, a sectarian clash had erupted nearby at the New Lodge\u2013Tiger's Bay interface. The British Army and RUC moved in and a gun battle developed. A British Army officer, Major Jeremy Snow, was shot by the IRA on New Lodge Road and died of his wounds on 8 December. Two RUC officers and five civilians were also wounded by gunfire. Eventually, five companies of troops were sent into the district and they searched almost 50 houses.\n\nMeanwhile, the UVF team had driven to a nearby pickup point where they dumped their car. They walked to the area of St Anne's Cathedral and were picked up by another. They were driven back to the Shankill and met the man who had ordered the attack in an Orange Hall, telling him that \"the job has been done\".\n\nAmong those killed were Philomena and Maria McGurk, wife and 14-year-old daughter of the pub owner Patrick McGurk. Patrick and his three sons were seriously injured. Shortly after the attack, McGurk appeared on television calling for no retaliation: \"It doesn't matter who planted the bomb. What's done can't be undone. I've been trying to keep bitterness out of it.\"\n\n==Investigation==\n===Responsibility===\nAfter the bombing, the media reported various theories about who was responsible. The main theories were:\n*that it had been planted by loyalists;\n*that it had exploded prematurely while being prepared by IRA members inside the pub;\n*that it had exploded prematurely while \"in transit\", an IRA member having left it in the pub to be collected by another IRA member; and\n*that it had been planted as part of a feud between the Provisional IRA and Official IRA.\n\nThe security forces promoted the idea that it was an IRA bomb which exploded prematurely (an \"own goal\"). Survivors and relatives denied this. They said the pub was not associated with the IRA and there had been no suspicious people or activity in the pub that night. An Intelligence Corps document from December 1971 also said that the pub was not known to have IRA associations. On 6 December, both wings of the IRA condemned the attack, denied responsibility and blamed the UVF and security forces.\n\n====Claims of responsibility====\nThat same day, several newspapers received telephone calls from someone claiming to be a spokesman for the \"Empire Loyalists\". Their statement to the Belfast Telegraph was:We [the Empire Loyalists] accept responsibility for the destruction of McGurk's pub. We placed 30lb of new explosives outside the pub because we had proved beyond doubt that meetings of IRA Provisionals and Officials were held there. The \"Empire Loyalists\" had made only one other claim of responsibility; for bombing a community centre on 12 November. The RUC, however, had no intelligence about such a group; suggesting that it may have been a covername.\n\nOn Tuesday 7 December, a youth claimed to have seen a man acting oddly at a phone kiosk the night before. He said the man was wearing a jacket with a UVF badge on it. The youth claimed to have checked the kiosk after the man left and found a torn bit of paper. When put together, it included the lines:We the Empire Loyalists wish to state that we did not destroy McGurk's public house as an act of retaliation ... Furthermore we do not require the forensic experts of the Army to cover up for us ... We shall not issue any further statements until we exterminate another rebel stronghold.\n\nIn the days following the bombing, the RUC received a letter signed by \"Chief of Staff, UVF\" claiming that the UVF bombed the pub because an IRA meeting was due to take place there. It said that two UVF members entered the pub, had a drink and asked the barman to mind a package while they \"ran an errand\". Witnesses told the RUC, however, that there had been no strangers in the pub and that nobody had left a package. Three other unsigned letters were sent to the RUC, claiming it was an IRA bomb \"in transit\" and that two IRA members were killed.\n\n====Location of the bomb====\n\nFor the RUC, the location of the bomb (whether it exploded inside or outside) became the key to finding who was responsible. However, investigators (both RUC and British Army) were unsure and gave conflicting opinions.\n\nRUC duty officers' reports were made daily. Their purpose was to brief the Chief Constable and others at HQ about events that had happened that day. The reports were also made available to the British Army's General Officer Commanding for Northern Ireland. The 4\u20135 December 1971 report said of the bombing: \"Just before the explosion a man entered the licensed premises and left down a suitcase, presumably to be picked up by a known member of the IRA. The bomb was intended for use on other premises. Before the 'pick-up' was made the bomb exploded\". The origin of this information could not be established.\n\nOn 6 December, however, the RUC took a witness statement from an 8-year-old boy. He said that a car had stopped outside the pub with four men inside and \"a wee Union Jack stuck in the back window\". He said one left a package in the Great George's Street doorway and ran back to the car, which sped off just moments before the package exploded. A man and a woman backed up his story, although they did not witness as much as the boy. \n  \nDespite this, the security forces and the government stood behind the \"own goal\" theory. A British Intelligence Corps document covering the period 8\u201315 December said: \"It has been confirmed that it was a [Provisional IRA] bomb which was destined for another target, but exploded prematurely.\" A Ministry of Defence (MOD) document dated 14 December said that this \"should be publicised\". On 23 December, the British Army sent a letter (signed by a lieutenant colonel) to people living in north Belfast. It said that when the IRA in the area is destroyed, \"we can look forward to \u2026 a period in which you will not lose your friends in a repetition of the [IRA's] accident in the McGurk\u2019s bar.\"\n\n===Arrest and conviction of Robert Campbell===\nIn March 1976, the RUC received intelligence that linked UVF member Robert Campbell and four others to the McGurk's bombing. Campbell was arrested on 27 July 1977 and held at Castlereagh RUC base. He was interviewed seven times during 27 and 28 July. He admitted his part in the bombing but refused to name the others. Campbell's story matches that given by the young boy witness.\n\nOn 29 July 1977, Campbell was charged with the 15 murders and 17 attempted murders. On 6 September 1978 he pleaded guilty to all charges and received life imprisonment with \"a recommendation to serve no less than 20 years\", in part for a separate conviction for the murder of a Protestant delivery driver in 1976. He is the only person to have been charged for the bombing. He eventually served fifteen years in prison and was released on 9 September 1993.\n\n===Collusion claims and Police Ombudsman's investigation===\nThe victims' relatives campaigned for an independent investigation of the bombing as they believed that the RUC's investigation was flawed from the outset. Moreover, they wished to disprove the claim that the victims were IRA members killed by their own bomb (the \"own goal\" theory). Even after Campbell's conviction, the \"own goal\" theory remained officially unchallenged. Relatives argued that this theory was promoted as part of a \"government policy to avoid publicly acknowledging the loyalist campaign of violence\". Another argument is that it was promoted to undermine the IRA's support and stir tension between the two IRA factions.\n\nRelatives also asked how the bombers were able to plant the bomb and flee despite the usually heavy security presence. Some alleged that the security forces helped the bombers by removing checkpoints. The 2009 book Killing For Britain, written by former UVF member 'John Black', claimed that the British undercover unit known as the Military Reaction Force or Military Reconnaissance Force (MRF) organized the bombing and helped the bombers get in and out of the area. The bombers' original target, The Gem, was associated with the Official IRA. It is claimed that the MRF ordered the team to bomb The Gem, with the intention of blaming it on the Provisional IRA. The plan was allegedly to start a feud between the two IRA factions, which would both divert them from their campaign against British forces and drain their support. However, as The Gem had security outside, they bombed the nearest 'Catholic pub'.\n\nOn 21 February 2011, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland published a report about the bombing and the RUC's investigation of it. The report said that there is no evidence that the RUC helped the UVF bombers. However, it found that the RUC investigation was biased in favour of the view that the IRA was responsible. It failed to give enough thought to the possible involvement of loyalists, and this bias hindered the investigation. The report also found that RUC gave \"selective\" and \"misleading\" briefings to the government and media, which furthered the idea that it was an IRA bomb. The Ombudsman has not found an explanation why successive Chief Constables have not addressed this mistake. Ombudsman Al Hutchinson said: \"Inconsistent police briefings, some of which inferred that victims of the bombing were culpable in the atrocity, caused the bereaved families great distress, which has continued for many years\".\n\nOn 6 December 2012, Scottish Labour MP Michael Connarty - whose uncle was killed in the bombing - claimed in Westminster that then-Prime Minister Edward Heath \"may have been involved\" in wrongfully blaming the IRA and spreading the story. Connarty also urged David Cameron, Prime Minister at the time, to apologise to victims and launch a full investigation.\n\n==Remembrance==\n\nIn 2001 a memorial was unveiled on the site of McGurk's Bar to mark the 30th anniversary of the bombing. Relatives of the victims called for an investigation into allegations that British forces helped the bombers. Almost a thousand people attended a service at St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street, after which fifteen wreaths, one for each victim, were carried by relatives leading a silent candlelit procession to a new memorial at Great George's Street.\n\nPatrick McGurk died on 15 December 2007, having forgiven those responsible for the explosion and having prayed for the men who carried out the attack.\n\n==See also==\n*Dublin and Monaghan bombings\n*Glasgow pub bombings\n*Timeline of Ulster Volunteer Force actions\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n* The true story of the McGurk's Bar Massacre, told by the families of the victims themselves.\n* News Hound \u2013 McGurk's bombing\n* CAIN \u2013 List of 1971 deaths in the Troubles\n* House of Commons debate on the bombing\n*  The Newlodge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaque near the site of the bombing listing those killed.\nA mock-up of the original bar erected close to its original location, December 2011.\nMemorial on Great George's Street.","urls":["http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/northern_ireland\/1683058.stm","https:\/\/archive.is\/20140821165015\/http:\/\/www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk\/news\/local-national\/northern-ireland\/mcgurks-bar-massacre-victim-confronts-killer-28593468.html","https:\/\/www.policeombudsman.org\/PONI\/files\/8b\/8b63d4ea-7575-4015-b9bf-1548536a9f2f.pdf","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140401030319\/http:\/\/www.policeombudsman.org\/Publicationsuploads\/McGurk%27s---Final-Report.pdf","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/historyofulster00jona\/page\/635","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/historyofulster00jona\/page\/635","https:\/\/archive.is\/20130420004509\/http:\/\/www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk\/news\/local-national\/recriminations-still-fly-over-mcgurks-bar-massacre-14870866.html","https:\/\/publications.parliament.uk\/pa\/cm200708\/cmhansrd\/cm080714\/debtext\/80714-0018.htm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160304001100\/http:\/\/www.publications.parliament.uk\/pa\/cm200708\/cmhansrd\/cm080714\/debtext\/80714-0018.htm","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/cgi-bin\/dyndeaths.pl","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/sutton\/chron\/1971.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160422085336\/http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/sutton\/chron\/1971.html","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/onthisday\/hi\/dates\/stories\/december\/4\/newsid_3403000\/3403883.stm","http:\/\/www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk\/news\/mcgurk-bar-owner-dies-28070889.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20130302032801\/http:\/\/mcgurksbar.com\/collusion\/","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-northern-ireland-20629776","http:\/\/republican-news.org\/archive\/2001\/December06\/06mcgu.html"]}
{"title":"Bloody Friday (1972)","article":"Bloody Friday is the name given to the bombings by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) in Belfast, Northern Ireland on 21 July 1972, during the Troubles. At least twenty bombs exploded in the space of eighty minutes, most within a half hour period. Most of them were car bombs and most targeted infrastructure, especially the transport network. Nine people were killed: five civilians, two British soldiers, a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) reservist, and an Ulster Defence Association (UDA) member, while 130 were injured. The IRA said it sent telephoned warnings at least thirty minutes before each explosion and said that the security forces wilfully ignored some of the warnings for its own ends. The security forces said that was not the case and said they were overstretched by the sheer number of bombs and bomb warnings, some of which were hoaxes.\n\nThe bombings were partly a response to the breakdown of talks between the IRA and the British government. Since the beginning of its campaign in 1970, the IRA had carried out a bombing campaign against economic, military and political targets in Northern Ireland and less often elsewhere. It carried out 1,300 bombings in 1972. However, Bloody Friday was a major setback for the IRA and there was a backlash against the organization. Immediately after the bombings, the security forces carried out raids on the homes of republicans. Ten days later, the British Army launched Operation Motorman, in which it re-took the no-go areas controlled by Republicans. Loyalist paramilitaries also reacted to the bombings by carrying out 'revenge' attacks on Catholic civilians.\n\nOn the thirtieth anniversary of the bombings, the IRA formally apologized to the families of all the civilians it had killed and injured.\n\n==Background==\nIn late June and early July 1972, a British government delegation led by Secretary of State of Northern Ireland William Whitelaw held secret talks with the Provisional IRA leadership. As part of the talks, the IRA agreed to a temporary ceasefire beginning on 26 June. The IRA leaders sought a peace settlement that included a British withdrawal from Northern Ireland by 1975 and the release of republican prisoners. However, the British refused and the talks broke down. The ceasefire came to an end on 9 July.\n\n'Bloody Friday' was the IRA's response to the breakdown of the talks. According to the IRA's Chief of Staff, Se\u00e1n Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in, the main goal of the bombing operation was to wreak financial harm. It was a \"message to the British government that the IRA could and would make a commercial desert of the city unless its demands were met\". Some also saw it as a reprisal for Bloody Sunday in Derry six months earlier. The attack was carried out by the IRA's Belfast Brigade and the main organiser was Brendan Hughes, the brigade's Officer Commanding.\n\n==The bombings==\nThe bombings happened during an 80-minute period on the afternoon of Friday 21 July. At least 24 bombs were planted; at least 20 exploded and the rest failed to detonate or were defused. At the height of the bombing, the middle of Belfast \"resembled a city under artillery fire; clouds of suffocating smoke enveloped buildings as one explosion followed another, almost drowning out the hysterical screams of panicked shoppers\". According to The Guardian: \"for much of the afternoon, Belfast was reduced to near total chaos and panic. Thousands streamed out of the stricken city [\u2026] and huge traffic jams built up. All bus services were cancelled, and on some roads, hitch-hikers frantically trying to get away lined the pavements\".\n\nNine people were killed and a further 130 injured, some of them horrifically mutilated. Of those injured, 77 were women and children. All of the deaths were caused by two of the bombs: at Oxford Street bus depot, and at Cavehill Road. The Oxford Street bomb killed two British soldiers and four Ulsterbus employees. One of these employees was a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) reservist; one was an Ulster loyalist paramilitary; and the other two were civilians. The Cavehill Road bomb killed three civilians.\n\n===Timeline===\n\nThe accounts of the events that appeared in the first editions of local and national newspapers were, naturally enough, somewhat confused about the details of the events of the day. The timetable below is approximate and given in BST (GMT+1). The details are based on a number of accounts.\n\n; ~210 pm (Smithfield bus station): A car bomb exploded in an enclosed yard at Smithfield bus station, destroying many buses and causing extensive damage to the surrounding area. Some sources give the time of this bombing as 3:10 pm.\n\n; ~216 pm (Brookvale Hotel) : A bomb (estimated at 50 pounds (23\u00a0kg) of explosive) exploded at the Brookvale Hotel on Brookvale Avenue. The bomb was left in a suitcase by three men armed with sub-machine guns. The area had been cleared and there were no injuries. Some sources give the time of this bombing as 2:36 pm.\n\n; ~223 pm (Railway station, York Road) : A bomb (estimated at 30 pounds (14\u00a0kg) of explosive) exploded in a suitcase on the platform, wrecking the inside of the station and blowing the roof off. The station had not been fully cleared and there were some injuries. Some sources give the time of this bombing as 3:03 pm.\n\n; ~240 pm (Ulster Bank, Limestone Road) : A car bomb (estimated at 50 pounds (23\u00a0kg) of explosive) exploded outside the Ulster Bank on Limestone Road. The area had not been cleared and several people were seriously injured. Some sources give the time of this bombing as 2:50 pm.\n\n; ~245 pm (Crumlin Road) : A car bomb exploded at the Star Taxis depot on Crumlin Road. Nearby were the houses of the Crumlin Road Prison warders and the prison itself. Some sources say that there were two bombs and that both exploded at 3:25 pm.\n\n; ~248 pm (Railway station, Great Victoria Street) : A van bomb exploded in the station's bus yard. Four buses were wrecked and 44 others damaged. The nearby Murray's Tobacco Factory in Sandy Row was also damaged.\n\n; ~252 pm (Railway station, Botanic Avenue) : A car bomb (estimated at 50 pounds (23\u00a0kg) of explosive) exploded outside the station. There was much damage to property, including a hotel, but no serious injuries.\n\n; ~255 pm (Queen Elizabeth Bridge) : A car bomb (estimated at 160 pounds (73\u00a0kg) of explosive) exploded on the Queen Elizabeth Bridge. There was some damage to the structure of the bridge but no serious injuries.\n\n; ~257 pm (Gas Department Offices, Ormeau Avenue) : A car bomb (estimated at 50 pounds (23\u00a0kg) of explosive) exploded outside the offices of the Gas Department, causing extensive damage but no serious injuries.\n\n; ~259 pm (Garmoyle Street) : A parcel bomb, which had been planted by armed men, exploded at the premises of John Irwin seed merchants. The building was destroyed. \n\n; ~302 pm (Oxford Street bus station) : A car bomb exploded at the Ulsterbus station on Oxford Street, one of the busiest bus stations in Northern Ireland, killing six and injuring almost forty. This was the highest number of casualties from any of the bombs. An Austin 1100 saloon car loaded with explosives had been driven in to the rear of the depot.\nThe car had been stolen from outside Inglis\u2019 bakery in Eliza Street in the Markets area of Belfast between 6.15am and when the owner discovered it missing at 2.30pm on Friday, July 21, 1972, whilst the owner was at work in the bakery.\nA telephoned warning was sent to the RUC 22 minutes before the bomb exploded. According to the RUC, the line to the station was busy, so they asked the Army to send a patrol. The patrol arrived in an armoured vehicle and began clearing the area. Rather than evacuating, some Ulsterbus workers had begun searching for the bomb. While this was ongoing, it exploded. Two British soldiers, Stephen Cooper (19) and Philip Price (27), were killed outright. Four Ulsterbus workers, all Protestants, were killed: Robert 'Jackie' Gibson (45), Thomas Killops (39), William Irvine (18) and William Crothers (15). Jackie Gibson was a bus driver and had joined the part-time RUC Reserve just a few weeks earlier he had finished his bus route minutes before the blast. Irvine was a member of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), a loyalist paramilitary group. Some of the victims' bodies were torn to pieces by the blast, which led authorities to give an initial estimate of 11 deaths. Some sources give the time of this bombing as 3:10 pm.\n\n; ~302 pm (Liverpool ferry terminus, Donegall Quay) : A car bomb (estimated at 50 pounds (23\u00a0kg) of explosive) exploded at the Belfast\u2013Liverpool ferry terminus at Donegall Quay. The nearby Liverpool Bar was badly damaged. Some sources give the time of this bombing as 2:57 pm.\n\n; ~304 pm (M2 motorway bridge, Bellevue) : A car bomb (estimated at 30 pounds (14\u00a0kg) of explosive) partially exploded on a road bridge over the M2 motorway at the Bellevue Arms in north Belfast. As the bomb only partially detonated, nearby buildings were not damaged.\n\n; ~305 pm (Filling station, Upper Lisburn Road) : A car bomb exploded at Creighton's filling station, setting the petrol pumps ablaze.\n\n; ~305 pm (Electrical substation, Salisbury Avenue) : A car bomb exploded at an electrical substation at the junction of Salisbury Avenue and Hughenden Avenue. The substation was badly damaged but there were no injuries.\n\n; ~305 pm (Railway bridge, Finaghy Road North) : A lorry bomb exploded on a road bridge over the railway line at Finaghy Road North.\n\n; ~309 pm (Railway bridge, Windsor Park) : A bomb (estimated at 30 pounds (14\u00a0kg) of explosive) exploded on a bridge over the railway line near Windsor Park football grounds. Some sources say the bomb exploded on a footbridge, while others say it exploded on Tate's Avenue road bridge. Concrete sleepers were blown on to the line, blocking it. One source gave the time of this bombing as 2:09 pm.\n\n; ~312 pm (Eastwood's Garage, Donegall Street) : A car bomb (estimated at 150 pounds (68\u00a0kg) of explosive) destroyed Eastwood's Garage on Donegall Street. There were several injuries.\n\n; ~315 pm (Stewartstown Road) : A bomb, thought to have been abandoned on the Stewartstown Road, exploded but caused no serious injuries.\n\n; ~315 pm (Cavehill Road) : A car bomb (estimated at 50 pounds (23\u00a0kg) of explosive) exploded outside a row of single storey shops near the top of Cavehill Road, north Belfast. The shops were in a religiously-mixed residential area. A warning had been sent more than an hour before, but those in the area had not received the warning and the area had not been evacuated. Two women and a boy died in this blast. Margaret O'Hare (37), a Catholic mother of seven children, died in her car. Her 11-year-old daughter was with her in the car and was badly injured. Catholic Brigid Murray (65) and Protestant teenager Stephen Parker (14) were also killed. Many others were seriously injured. Parker had spotted the bomb shortly before it exploded and was attempting to warn people when he was killed. His father, the Reverend Joseph Parker, was only able to identify his son's body at the mortuary by the box of trick matches in his pocket, and the shirt and Scout belt he had been wearing. Some sources give the time of this bombing as 3:20 pm.\n\n; ~330 pm (Grosvenor Road) : A bomb (estimated at 50 pounds (23\u00a0kg) of explosive) exploded at the Northern Ireland Carriers depot on Grosvenor Road. There were no serious injuries.\n\nTwo other bombs were defused: one on the Albert Bridge and one on a road bridge over the Sydenham bypass.\n\nThere were also notable IRA bombings outside Belfast on Bloody Friday. In Derry, a 300lb van bomb exploded at Waterloo Place, near the city's RUC headquarters. It blasted the six-storey Embassy Court building and dislodged a British Army observation post on the roof. Another IRA bomb de-railed ten wagons of a goods train near Portadown. There were three other large car bombs that exploded in Derry city, however unlike in Belfast the Derry bombings did not cause a single injury.\n\n===Warnings===\nThe IRA's Belfast Brigade claimed responsibility for the bombings and said that it had given warnings to the security forces before the bombs exploded. It said that the Public Protection Agency, the Samaritans and the press \"were informed of bomb positions at least 30 minutes to one hour before each explosion\". Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in said that \"It required only one man with a loud hailer to clear each target area in no time\" and alleged that the warnings for the two bombs that claimed lives were deliberately ignored by the British for \"strategic policy reasons\".\n\nThe Public Protection Agency said it received telephoned warnings of the two bombs that claimed lives, and immediately passed the warnings on to the security forces. It said it received a warning of the Cavehill Road bomb an hour and eight minutes before the explosion, and a warning of the Oxford Street bomb 22 minutes before the explosion. According to an article in The Guardian, a warning of the Oxford Street bomb was heard over military radio almost an hour before the explosion.\n\nThe security forces denied that they wilfully ignored warnings and said they were overstretched by the sheer number of bombs and bomb warnings. The security forces also received hoax warnings, which \"added to the chaos in the streets\". The RUC and British Army only effectively cleared a small number of areas before the bombs went off. Furthermore, because of the large number bomb threats in the confined area of Belfast city centre, people evacuated from the site of one bomb were mistakenly moved into the vicinity of other bombs.\n\n==Immediate aftermath==\nAfter the bombings there was a two-hour emergency meeting at Stormont Castle. It was attended by William Whitelaw, the British government's Secretary of State for Northern Ireland; Peter Carrington, Secretary of State for Defence; Harry Tuzo, the British Army's commander in Northern Ireland; David Corbett, the acting chief of the RUC; and other advisers. Whitelaw announced that immediate action would be taken against the IRA. Unionist politicians demanded a further wave of arrests and internment of IRA suspects.\n\nOn Friday night, 2,000 British troops began carrying out raids on the homes of IRA suspects in Belfast. They arrested 58 people and seized bomb-making equipment, explosives and ammunition. The raids sparked gun battles. In the Markets area, IRA member Joseph Downey (23) was shot dead and five other people were wounded. The British Army claim to have hit at least three gunmen. In Ardoyne, at least 900 shots were fired at soldiers and the British Army claim to have hit at least five gunmen. In Andersonstown, two soldiers were shot and they claim to have hit one gunman. Shots were also fired at the security force bases on Oldpark Road, Glenravel Street and York Street. The raids continued over the next three days. More than 100 people were arrested, weapons were seized in Belfast and Portadown, and barricades were demolished in Belfast and Armagh.\n\nLoyalist paramilitaries also reacted to the bombings. On Friday night, members of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) took to the streets in Protestant areas and began carrying out 'patrols' and setting up checkpoints. Four Catholic civilians were killed by loyalists that night, allegedly in retaliation for the bombings. Joseph Rosato (59) was shot by gunmen who called at his home in the Oldpark district. Patrick O'Neill (26) and Rosemary McCartney (27) were found shot dead in a car on Forthriver Road. Another, Francis Arthurs (34) was found shot dead in a car on Liffey Street.\n\n==Reactions and consequences==\n\nAccording to former RUC officer Jack Dale, a large group of people in the republican Markets area had \"jeered and shouted and yelled\" as if each explosion was \"a good thing\".\n\nSpeaking in the House of Commons on 24 July, William Whitelaw called the bombings \"appallingly bloodthirsty\". He also drew attention to the Catholic victims, and mentioned the revulsion in the Republic of Ireland and elsewhere. Leader of the Opposition Harold Wilson described the events as \"a shocking crime against an already innocent population\". The Irish Times wrote, \"The chief injury is not to the British Army, to the Establishment or to big business but to the plain people of Belfast and Ireland. Anyone who supports violence from any side after yesterday's events is sick with the same affliction as those who did the deed\". Television images of fire-fighters shovelling body parts into plastic bags at the Oxford Street bus station were the most shocking of the day.\n\nTwenty-five years later, a police officer who had been at Oxford Street bus station described to journalist Peter Taylor the scene he came upon in the wake of the bombing\n\nThe first thing that caught my eye was a torso of a human being lying in the middle of the street. It was recognisable as a torso because the clothes had been blown off and you could actually see parts of the human anatomy. One of the victims was a soldier I knew personally. He'd had his arms and legs blown off and some of his body had been blown through the railings. One of the most horrendous memories for me was seeing a head stuck to the wall. A couple of days later, we found vertebrae and a rib cage on the roof of a nearby building. The reason we found it was because the seagulls were diving onto it. I've tried to put it at the back of my mind for twenty-five years.\n\nIn The Longest War, author Kevin Kelley wrote that the IRA \"had done irreparable damage to their cause \u2013 in Britain, abroad, and in their own communities. They had handed Britain a perfect propaganda opportunity \u2013 Bloody Friday could not be equated with Bloody Sunday. Nearly everyone was sickened by the slaughter\".\n\nTen days after the bombings, the British Army launched Operation Motorman, in which it re-took IRA-controlled areas in Belfast and Derry. It was the biggest British military operation since the Suez Crisis of 1956. In his memoirs, Whitelaw wrote \"The re-establishment of control required a major military operation. Fortunately [\u2026] the IRA leaders gave me further propaganda assistance. While the planning for [Operation Motorman] was in progress they unleashed a savage bombing operation in the centre of Belfast\".\n\nThe City of Belfast Youth Orchestra set up the Stephen Parker Memorial Trust in memory of teenager Stephen Parker, who had been a music student and played the French horn in the orchestra at the time he was killed. Parker was posthumously awarded the Queen's Commendation for bravery as he had died while trying to warn others about the car bomb left outside the row of shops on Cavehill Road.\n\n===Irish republican reaction===\nFor the IRA, it was \"an operation gone awry\". IRA Chief of Staff, Se\u00e1n Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in, said the civilian casualties \"compromised the intended effect\" of the bombings. Brendan Hughes, Officer Commanding of the IRA's Belfast Brigade, viewed the attack as a disaster. He described his reaction in an interview organised by Boston College:\n\nI was the operational commander of the \"Bloody Friday\" operation. I remember when the bombs started to go off, I was in Leeson Street, and I thought, \"There's too much here\". I sort of knew that there were going to be casualties, either [because] the Brits could not handle so many bombs or they would allow some to go off because it suited them to have casualties. I feel a bit guilty about it because, as I say, there was no intention to kill anyone that day. I have a fair deal of regret that \"Bloody Friday\" took place ... a great deal of regret ... If I could do it over again I wouldn't do it.\n\nIn July 2002, the Provisional IRA issued a statement of apology to An Phoblacht, which read:\n\n\n\n==See also==\n*Timeline of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n* Bloody Friday at the Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN)\n* List of dead, from Malcolm Sutton's \"Index of Deaths from the Conflict in Ireland\"\n* Northern Ireland Office news-sheet about the bombings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAftermath of the Oxford Street bomb showing the remains of one of the victims being shovelled into a bag.","urls":["http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/events\/bfriday\/nio\/nio72.htm","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/events\/peace\/docs\/ira160702.htm","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/northern_ireland\/2132188.stm","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/brits00pete\/page\/139","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/brits00pete\/page\/139","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/uk_news\/northern_ireland\/2132219.stm","http:\/\/encarta.msn.com\/encyclopedia_761571415_8\/Northern_Ireland.html","https:\/\/www.webcitation.org\/5kwQB9k6d?url=http:\/\/encarta.msn.com\/encyclopedia_761571415_8\/Northern_Ireland.html","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/uk\/1972\/jul\/22\/northernireland.simonhoggart","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/events\/bfriday\/events.htm","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/history\/events\/bloody_friday_belfast","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/sutton\/chron\/1972.html","http:\/\/www.u.tv\/News\/Bloody-Friday-never-forgotten-by-victims\/2fcb4a70-6ba9-4cf6-b1eb-e87eed546f98","https:\/\/archive.is\/20130418195544\/http:\/\/www.u.tv\/News\/Bloody-Friday-never-forgotten-by-victims\/2fcb4a70-6ba9-4cf6-b1eb-e87eed546f98","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/events\/bfriday\/sum.htm","http:\/\/www.newsletter.co.uk\/news\/local\/sf-should-help-solve-bloody-friday-say-mps-1-4071073","https:\/\/publications.parliament.uk\/pa\/cm200304\/cmselect\/cmdfence\/57\/3070205.htm","http:\/\/www.independent.ie\/opinion\/analysis\/cry-for-reconciliation--which-should-be-welcomed--by-all-299816.html","http:\/\/www.cbyo.co.uk\/stephenparker.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110911232623\/http:\/\/www.cbyo.co.uk\/stephenparker.html","http:\/\/www.creggan.armagh.anglican.org\/firstba.html"]}
{"title":"Newry customs bombing","article":"On 22 August 1972 a bomb planted by the Provisional Irish Republican Army, an Irish republican paramilitary group, detonated prematurely at a customs office in Newry. Three IRA members killed six civilians and themselves in the explosion. The event was one of the bloodiest of 1972, the deadliest year of The Troubles.\n\n== Background ==\nSince 1971, the Provisional IRA had been waging a campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland. Gun and bomb attacks became daily occurrences in the province as the campaign continued. In January 1972, soldiers from the Parachute Regiment shot dead 14 civil rights protesters in Derry, in an event later known as Bloody Sunday. The attack enraged the nationalist community and as a result support for the IRA surged. In the following months the ferocity of the conflict, and as a result number of casualties, rose dramatically.\n\nMilitary installations and civilian businesses were targeted frequently. Civilians often fell victim to the IRA's attacks. This most prominently occurred on Bloody Friday, when at least 20 bombs planted by the IRA exploded in quick succession in Belfast. As a result of the bombs, 9 people were killed and another 130 injured.\n\nNewry, a mainly nationalist town near the Irish border, had a lot of IRA supporters. Attacks had already taken place in the town, leading to seven people - three civilians, two police officers, one British soldier and one IRA volunteer - being killed.  \n\n== Attack ==\nThree IRA members walked into the office with a bomb.

{"title":"Bombings of King's Cross and Euston stations","article":"The King's Cross station and Euston station bombings were two bombing attacks on 10 September 1973 by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) that targeted two mainline railway stations in central London. The blasts wounded 13 civilians, some of whom were seriously injured, and also caused large-scale but superficial damage. This was a second wave of bombing attacks launched by the IRA in England in 1973 after the Old Bailey car bombing earlier in the year which had killed one  and injured around 200 civilians.\n\n==Background==\n\n\nIn 1971, during The Troubles, after two years engaged in violence based on a defensive strategy in Irish communal districts of Northern Ireland, the Provisional IRA launched an offensive against the United Kingdom. At a meeting of the IRA Army Council in June 1972 the organization's Chief of Staff, Se\u00e1n Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in, first proposed making bombing attacks in England. The Army Council did not at first agree to the suggestion, but in early 1973 after its negotiations with the British Government for a truce the previous year had failed to advance the political objective of the removal of Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom by the application of the threat of violence, it re-engaged its paramilitary campaign and sanctioned Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in's proposal. Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in had put the strategy forward on the basis that extending the urban paramilitary violence of the Northern Ireland state into England would help to relieve pressure being exerted by the British Army on the IRA's strongholds of Irish communal support in districts in the province, such as West Belfast and Derry, by diverting British security strength from them back into England, whilst at the same time increasing strategic pressure upon the British Government to resolve the conflict by political concessions to the IRA's demands. He also believed that a successful bombing campaign in London, as the capital city of the United Kingdom, would offer substantial propaganda value for paramilitary Irish Republicanism, and provide a morale boost to its supporters.\n\nThe effects of the previous 1973 Old Bailey bombing appeared to give some credence to the idea of the propaganda value of extending violence into London as, although it would have been considered almost routine in Northern Ireland by the mid-1970s and have drawn only brief media notice, being carried out instead in London, a global capital city, had made the event world news headlines. However, although the bombing of the Old Bailey had been successfully carried out, and had gained media attention, increasing political pressure upon the British Government to address the issue of the conflict in Northern Ireland with more urgency, it had been costly to the IRA, as 10 out of the 11 man Active Service Unit that had carried it out had been arrested by the British police whilst trying to leave England before the bombs they had planted detonated. Drawing the tactical lesson that large teams were a security liability, for the second wave of bombings in England later in 1973, instead of sending a large team to carry it out with orders to withdraw back to Ireland immediately afterwards, smaller detached \"cell\" units of about 3-4 personnel were sent to carry out the operation, with instructions to remain in England afterwards and wage a campaign of bombings around England upon a variety of targets.\n\nThere were bombings on 8 September 1973, including one at Victoria railway station which injured four civilians.\n\n==Bombings==\nOn 10 September 1973 a bomb (with no warning issued beforehand) exploded at King's Cross railway station in the booking hall at 12.24 p.m. when a youth of around 16\/17 years of age walked up to the entrance of the station's old booking hall and threw a bag into it which contained a 3\u00a0lb (1.4\u00a0kg) device, which detonated, shattering glass throughout the hall and throwing a baggage trolley several feet into the air. The youth then fled into the station's crowd and escaped the scene.\n\nApproximately 45 minutes after the attack at King's Cross, after a telephone called warning 5 minutes beforehand by a man with an Irish accent to the Press Association, a second bomb detonated in a snack bar at Euston railway station, injuring another eight civilians. One witness at Euston said: \"I saw a flash and suddenly people were being thrown through the air - it was a terrible mess, they were bleeding and screaming\" A total of 13 civilians were injured in the two attacks. The Metropolitan Police issued a photofit picture of a 5\u00a0ft 2 tall 16\/17-year-old youth they were seeking in regard to the King's Cross attack.\n\n==Subsequent events==\nOn 12 September 1973 two more bombs exploded, one in Oxford Street and another in Sloane Square, targeting retail shopping centres. Police subsequently announced that they were looking for five people in connection with this second wave of bomb attacks in England.\n\nJudith Ward was later wrongly convicted for having been involved in the late 1973 London bombings, along with the M62 coach bombing. She was later acquitted. No one else was brought to trial for this IRA bombing campaign.\n\n==See also==\n*Bombings of Paddington and Victoria stations \n*Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions (1970\u201379)\n\n==Sources==\n* CAIN project \n* BBC ON THIS DAY  Bomb blasts rock central London \n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/othelem\/chron\/ch73.htm","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/othelem\/chron\/ch73.htm","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/cgi-bin\/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&day=8&month=03&year=1973","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/onthisday\/hi\/dates\/stories\/november\/14\/newsid_4724000\/4724181.stm","http:\/\/find.galegroup.com\/iln\/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=ILN&userGroupName=kccl&tabID=T003&docPage=article&docId=HN3100416456&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/theguardian\/1973\/sep\/11\/fromthearchive","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/onthisday\/hi\/dates\/stories\/september\/10\/newsid_2504000\/2504619.stm","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/onthisday\/hi\/dates\/stories\/november\/4\/newsid_2538000\/2538321.stm"]}

It was their first attack. The bombing culminated a year which saw a high number of racist violence incidents against Algerians in the country, particularly in Marseille, which was mainly ignited by the murder of a local bus driver by a deranged Algerian youngster on 25 August 1973.\n\nOn 28 January 2018, a memorial plaque was laid down on the consulate's entrance.\n\n==See also==\n*1980 Turkish Consulate attack in Lyon\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1973\/12\/15\/archives\/blast-hits-algerian-consulate-in-tense-marseilles-killing-4.html","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=-Xd_BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA88&lpg=PA88&dq=algerian+consulate+bomb+marseille+1973&source=bl&ots=K0kOA8x3Tk&sig=LDBZCbTvPhXQDJoE3NgP0Ht_6Mk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg482g7qncAhUM6KQKHWn1C3wQ6AEIVDAG","http:\/\/www.aps.dz\/en\/algeria\/22517-plaque-commemorating-1973-attack-against-consulate-general-of-algeria-in-marseille-laid-down"]}
{"title":"Birmingham pub bombings","article":"The Birmingham pub bombings were carried out on 21 November 1974, when bombs exploded in two public houses in Birmingham, England, killing 21 people and injuring 182 others.\n\nThe Provisional Irish Republican Army has never officially admitted responsibility for the Birmingham pub bombings, although a former senior officer of the organisation confessed to their involvement in 2014. In 2017, one of the alleged perpetrators, Michael Hayes, also claimed that the intention of the bombings had not been to harm civilians, and that their deaths had been caused by an unintentional delay in delivering an advance telephone warning to security services.\n\nSix Irishmen were arrested within hours of the blasts, and in 1975 sentenced to life imprisonment for the bombings. The men\u2014who became known as the Birmingham Six\u2014maintained their innocence and insisted police had coerced them into signing false confessions through severe physical and psychological abuse. After 16 years in prison, and a lengthy campaign, their convictions were declared unsafe and unsatisfactory, and quashed by the Court of Appeal in 1991. The episode is seen as one of the worst miscarriages of justice in British legal history.\n\nThe Birmingham pub bombings were one of the deadliest acts of the Troubles, and the deadliest act of terrorism to occur in England between the Second World War and the 2005 London bombings.\n\n==Background==\n\nIn 1973, the Provisional IRA extended its campaign to mainland Britain, attacking military and symbolically important targets to both increase pressure on the British government, via popular British opinion, to withdraw from Northern Ireland, and to maintain morale amongst their supporters. By 1974, mainland Britain saw an average of one attack\u2014successful or otherwise\u2014every three days. These attacks included five explosions which had occurred in Birmingham on 14 July, one of which had occurred at the Rotunda. Prior to any attack upon civilian targets, a code of conduct was followed in which the attacker or attackers would send an anonymous telephone warning to police, with the caller reciting a confidential code word known only to the Provisional IRA and to police, to indicate the authenticity of the threat.\n\nOn 14 November, James McDade, a 28-year-old UK-based member of the Provisional IRA, was killed in a premature explosion as he attempted to plant a bomb at a telephone exchange and postal sorting office in Coventry. Another man, Raymond McLaughlin, was arrested near the scene; he was charged with unlawfully killing McDade and causing an explosion. The republican movement in England had planned to bury McDade in Birmingham, with a paramilitary guard of honour. These plans were altered after the British Home Secretary vowed that such a funeral, and any associated sympathy marches, would be prevented. Councils in the West Midlands chose to ban any processions linked to the death of McDade under the Public Order Act 1936.\n\nMcDade's body was driven to Birmingham Airport and flown to Ireland on the afternoon of 21 November 1974. Initially, his body had been scheduled to be flown to Belfast Airport; however, upon learning that staff at the airport had refused to handle the coffin, McDade's body was instead flown to Dublin. All police leave was cancelled on this date, with an extra 1,300 officers drafted into Birmingham to quell any unrest as the hearse carrying McDade's coffin was driven to the airport. McDade's body was buried in Milltown Cemetery in Belfast on 23 November. According to a senior Provisional IRA figure, tensions within the Birmingham IRA unit were \"running high\" over the disrupted funeral arrangements for James McDade.\n\n==The bombings==\nIn the early evening hours of 21 November, at least three bombs connected to timing devices were planted inside two separate public houses and outside a bank located in and around central Birmingham. It is unknown precisely when these bombs were planted; if official IRA protocol of preceding attacks upon non-military installations with a 30-minute advance warning to security services was followed, and subsequent eyewitness accounts are accurate, the bombs would have been planted at these locations after 19:30 and before 19:47.\n\nAccording to testimony delivered at the 1975 trial of the six men wrongly convicted of the Birmingham pub bombings, the bomb planted inside the Mulberry Bush was concealed inside either a duffel bag or briefcase, whereas the bomb planted inside the Tavern in the Town was concealed inside a briefcase or duffel bag (possibly concealed within a large, sealed plastic bag) and Christmas cracker boxes. The remnants of two alarm clocks recovered from the site of each explosion leaves the possibility that two bombs had been planted at each public house; the explosion crater at each location indicates that if two bombs had been planted at each public house, they would each have been placed in the same location and likely the same container.\n\nReportedly, those who planted these bombs then walked to a preselected phone box to telephone the advance warning to security services; however, the phone box had been vandalised, forcing the caller to find an alternative phone box and thus shortening the amount of time police had to clear the locations.\n\nAt 20:11, an unknown man with a distinct Irish accent telephoned the Birmingham Post newspaper. The call was answered by an operator named Ian Cropper. This caller said: \"There is a bomb planted in the Rotunda and there is a bomb in New Street at the tax office. This is Double X\", before terminating the call. (\"Double X\" was an IRA code word given to authenticate any warning call.) A similar warning was also sent to the Birmingham Evening Mail newspaper, with the anonymous caller(s) again giving the code word, but again failing to name the public houses in which the bombs had been planted.\n\n===Mulberry Bush===\nThe Rotunda is a 25-storey office block that housed the Mulberry Bush pub on its lower two floors. Within minutes of the warning, police arrived and began checking the upper floors of the Rotunda, but they did not have sufficient time to clear the crowded pub at street level. At 20:17, six minutes after the first telephone warning had been delivered to the Birmingham Post, the bomb\u2014which had been concealed inside either a duffel bag or briefcase located close to the rear entrance to the premises\u2014exploded, devastating the pub. The explosion blew a 40-inch (100\u00a0cm) crater in the concrete floor, collapsing part of the roof and trapping many casualties beneath girders and concrete blocks. Many buildings near the Rotunda were also damaged, and passersby in the street were struck by flying glass from shattered windows. Several of the fatalities were killed outright, including two youths who had been walking past the premises at the moment of the explosion.\n\nTen people were killed in this explosion and dozens were injured, including many who lost limbs. Several casualties had been impaled by sections of wooden furniture; others had their clothes burned from their bodies. A paramedic called to the scene of this explosion later described the carnage as being reminiscent of a slaughterhouse; one fireman said that, upon seeing a writhing, \"screaming torso\", he had begged police to allow a television crew inside the premises to film the dead and dying at the scene, in the hope the IRA would see the consequences of their actions; however, the police refused this request, fearing the reprisals would be extreme.\n\nOne of those injured was a 21-year-old woman named Maureen Carlin, who had such extensive shrapnel wounds to her stomach and bowel she told her fianc\u00e9, Ian Lord (himself badly wounded in the explosion): \"If I die, just remember I love you\". Carlin was given the last rites, with surgeons initially doubtful she would live, although she recovered from her injuries.\n\n===Tavern in the Town===\nThe Tavern in the Town was a basement pub on New Street located a short distance from the Rotunda and directly beneath the New Street Tax Office. Patrons there had heard the explosion at the Mulberry Bush, but did not believe that the sound (described by one survivor as a \"muffled thump\") was an explosion.\n\nPolice had begun attempting to clear the Tavern in the Town when, at 20:27, a second bomb exploded there. The blast was so powerful that several victims were blown through a brick wall. Their remains were wedged between the rubble and live underground electric cables that supplied the city centre. One of the first police officers on the scene, Brian Yates, later testified that the scene which greeted his eyes was \"absolutely dreadful\", with several of the dead stacked upon one another, others strewn about the ruined pub, and several screaming survivors staggering aimlessly amongst the debris, rubble, and severed limbs. A survivor said the sound of the explosion was replaced by a \"deafening silence\" and the smell of burnt flesh.\n\nRescue efforts at the Tavern in the Town were initially hampered as the bomb had been placed at the base of a set of stairs descending from the street which had been destroyed in the explosion, and the premises had been accessible solely via this entrance. The victims whose bodies had been blown through a brick wall and wedged between the rubble and underground electric cables took up to three hours to recover, as recovery operations were delayed until the power could be isolated. A passing West Midlands bus was also destroyed in the blast.\n\nThis bomb killed nine people outright, and injured everyone in the pub\u2014many severely; two later died of their injuries: 28-year-old barman Thomas Chaytor on 28 November, and 34-year-old James Craig on 10 December.\nAfter the second explosion, police evacuated all pubs and businesses in Birmingham City Centre and commandeered all available rooms in the nearby City Centre Hotel as an impromptu first-aid post. All bus services into the city centre were halted, and taxi drivers were encouraged to transport those lightly injured in the explosions to hospital. Prior to the arrival of ambulances, rescue workers removed critically injured casualties from each scene upon makeshift stretchers constructed from devices such as tabletops and wooden planks. These severely injured casualties would be placed on the pavement and given first aid prior to the arrival of ambulance services.\n\n===Hagley Road===\nAt 21:15, a third bomb, concealed inside two plastic bags, was found in the doorway of a Barclays Bank on Hagley Road, approximately two miles from the site of the first two explosions. This device consisted of  of Frangex connected to a timer, and was set to detonate at 23:00. The detonator to this device activated when a policeman prodded the bags with his truncheon, but the bomb did not explode; it was destroyed in a controlled explosion early the following morning.\n\n===Fatalities===\nAltogether, 21 people were killed and 182 injured in the Birmingham pub bombings, making them the deadliest terrorist attack in mainland Britain during the Troubles. Residents of Birmingham have referred to the Birmingham pub bombings as the \"darkest day\" in their city's history.\n\nMany of those wounded were left permanently disabled, including one young man who lost both legs, and a young woman who was blinded by shrapnel. The majority of the dead and wounded were between the ages of 17 and 30, including a young couple on their first date, and two Irishmen, brothers Desmond and Eugene Reilly (aged 21 and 23 respectively). The widow of Desmond Reilly gave birth to his first child four months after his death. One of the victims, 18-year-old Maxine Hambleton, had only entered the Tavern in the Town to hand out tickets to friends for her housewarming party. She was killed seconds after entering the pub and had been standing directly beside the bomb when it exploded, killing her instantly. Her friend, 17-year-old Jane Davis, was one of two 17-year-olds killed in the bombings, and had entered the Tavern in the Town to view holiday photographs she had developed that afternoon.\n\n==Initial reaction==\nThe bombings stoked considerable anti-Irish sentiment in Birmingham, which then had an Irish community of 100,000. Irish people were ostracised from public places and subjected to physical assaults, verbal abuse and death threats. Both in Birmingham and across England, Irish homes, pubs, businesses and community centres were attacked, in some cases with firebombs. Staff at thirty factories across the Midlands went on strike in protest at the bombings, while workers at airports across England refused to handle flights bound for Ireland. Bridget Reilly, the mother of the two Irish brothers killed in the Tavern in the Town explosion, was herself refused service in local shops.\n\nThe bombings were immediately blamed on the IRA, despite the organisation not having claimed responsibility. Due to anger against Irish people in Birmingham after the bombings, the IRA's Army Council placed the city \"strictly off-limits\" to IRA active service units. In Northern Ireland, loyalist paramilitaries launched a wave of revenge attacks on Irish Catholics: within two days of the bombings, five Catholic civilians had been shot dead by loyalists.\n\n===First IRA statement===\nTwo days after the bombings, the Provisional IRA issued a statement in which they denied any responsibility. The statement stressed that a detailed internal investigation was underway to determine the possibility of any rogue members' involvement, the Provisional IRA emphasised that the methodology of the attacks contradicted the official IRA code of conduct when attacking non-military targets, whereby adequate warnings would be sent to security services to ensure the safety of civilians. Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh, then-president of Sinn F\u00e9in, conducted an internal investigation which he stated confirmed the bombings had not been sanctioned by the IRA leadership.\n\nThe Provisional IRA never officially admitted responsibility for the Birmingham pub bombings.\n\n===Prevention of Terrorism Act===\nWithin four days of the bombings, Roy Jenkins, the Home Secretary, announced that the Irish Republican Army was to be proscribed within the UK. Two days later, on 27 November, Jenkins introduced the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1974,which granted the police in mainland Britain the right to arrest, detain, and question people for up to seven days if they were suspected of the commission or preparation of an act of terrorism on the British mainland, and their subsequent deportation to either Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland if culpability was proven. Jenkins later described the measures of this Act as being \"draconian measures unprecedented in peacetime\".\n\nIn response to public pressure, a separate debate within the House of Commons as to whether those convicted of terrorist offences should face the death penalty was held on 11 December 1974. This motion drew the support of more than 200 MPs, although the majority of those in Parliament voted against the restoration of the death penalty, reportedly in part due to fear that such a move could have encouraged the IRA to use children to plant bombs.\n\nThe Prevention of Terrorism Act became law on 29 November, and remained in force until superseded by the Terrorism Act in July 2000.\n\n===Forensic analysis===\nAn analysis of the remnants of the bombs placed at the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town revealed these devices had been constructed in a similar manner to the bomb placed at Hagley Road. Each bomb placed inside the public houses would have weighed between 25 and 30\u00a0lbs, and had contained numerous shards of metal. The forensic analyst was able to state that the construction of these devices was very similar to that of seven other bombs and incendiary devices discovered at various locations in Birmingham, Coventry and Wolverhampton in the 16 days prior to the Birmingham pub bombings, and that the explosive material used to construct the bomb discovered at Hagley Road was of a brand solely manufactured in the Irish Republic which could not legally be imported into Britain. All these factors led the explosives expert to conclude that all three bombs had been manufactured by the same people, and that it was likely that whoever had constructed these bombs had also committed previous IRA attacks. This conclusion was further supported by the methodology of the attacks, and the official IRA code word given to the Birmingham Evening Mail and Birmingham Post newspapers minutes before the explosions.\n\n==Arrest of the Birmingham Six==\n\nAt 19:55 on 21 November (scarcely 20 minutes before the first bomb had exploded), five men from Northern Ireland\u2014Patrick Hill, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, William Power and John Walker\u2014had boarded a train at Birmingham New Street station. These men\u2014who, alongside Hugh Callaghan, would become known as the \"Birmingham Six\"\u2014were originally from Northern Ireland. Five of the Birmingham Six hailed from Belfast, whereas John Walker had lived in Derry until age 16. All six men had lived in Birmingham for between 11 and 27 years respectively and, although they had known James McDade and\/or his family to varying degrees, each man was adamant they had not known of his IRA affiliations.\n\nWhen the bombs exploded, the booking clerk from whom the men had purchased tickets informed police that a man with an Irish accent, dressed in a dust-covered purple suit, had purchased a ticket to travel to the coastal village of Heysham, en route to Belfast. The man had then run onto the train. A spot check on ticket sales that evening revealed that four further tickets to travel to Belfast via Heysham had also been issued. Within three hours of the bombings, each man had been detained at Heysham Port and taken to Morecambe police station to undergo forensic tests to eliminate them as suspects in the bombings. Each man expressed their willingness to assist in these inquiries, having informed the officers of a half-truth as to the reason they had been travelling to Belfast: that they intended to visit their families, although they also intended to attend McDade's funeral.\n\nBetween 03:00 and 06:10 the following morning, forensic scientist Frank Skuse  conducted a series of Griess tests upon the hands, fingernails and belongings of the five men arrested at Heysham Port, to determine whether any of the men had handled the explosive nitroglycerine. He concluded with a 99% degree of certainty that both Patrick Hill and William Power had handled explosives, and remained uncertain as to the test results conducted on John Walker, whose right hand had tested positive, but whose left hand had tested negative. The test results upon Hunter and McIlkenny had been negative.\n\nEach man was ordered to change his clothes. A search of Walker's possessions revealed several mass cards printed in reference to the upcoming funeral of James McDade. Upon discovering these mass cards, two officers led Walker into an adjacent room, where he was repeatedly punched, kicked and, later, burned with a lit cigarette by three officers as his arms were restrained by the two policemen who had escorted him into the room. Similar assaults were committed upon Power, Hunter, Hill and, to a lesser degree, McIlkenny; the officers who administered these beatings took great care to avoid marking the men's faces.\n\nAt 12:55 on the afternoon of 22 November, while detained at Morecambe police station, William Power signed a confession admitting his involvement in the Birmingham pub bombings. This confession was extracted after Power had been subjected to extreme physical and psychological abuse, which included repeated kicking in the stomach, head and legs, dragging by the hair, and the stretching of his scrotum.\n\n===False confessions===\nThe five men were transferred to the custody of the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad on the afternoon of 22 November. At 22:45 that evening, Hugh Callaghan was arrested at his home in Birmingham and driven to Sutton Coldfield police station, where he was briefly questioned before being detained in a cell overnight, but intentionally denied sleep. The same evening Callaghan was arrested, the homes of all six men were extensively\u2014and unsuccessfully\u2014searched for explosives and explosive material.\n\nFollowing their transfer to the custody of the West Midlands Crime Squad, three other members of the Birmingham Six (Callaghan, McIlkenny and Walker) signed false confessions on 23 November. In these three further false statements obtained by the West Midlands Crime Squad, Callaghan, McIlkenny and Walker each falsely claimed to be members of the IRA; to have conspired with McDade to cause explosions prior to his death; and to have planted the bombs at the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town public houses. As had been the case with William Power while detained at Morecambe police station, the three men later claimed that, before and during their transfer to Birmingham, officers had coerced them into signing these confessions through severe physical, psychological and emotional abuse. This mistreatment included beatings, deprivation of food and sleep, being subject to mock executions, intimidation, being burned with lit cigarettes, and being forced to stand or squat in various stress positions. In addition, each man had heard threats directed against their families. Hill and Hunter both claimed they had been subject to the same mistreatment, and although both men had refused to sign false confessions, police later claimed that both men had verbally confessed their guilt. On 24 November, each man was initially charged with the murder of 17-year-old Jane Davis, who had been killed in the Tavern in the Town explosion. All six were remanded in custody at Winson Green Prison, and they were only assigned solicitors the following day.\n\nInside Winson Green Prison, all six men were subject to the same mistreatment at the hands of prison officers as they had endured at the hands of police, with one of the men losing four teeth in one assault. At a further court hearing on 28 November, each man was observed to have extensive facial injuries; an examination by a prison doctor revealed each man had received extensive injuries not only to their faces, but across their bodies. (Following an independent investigation into this mistreatment, the British Director of Public Prosecutions recommended that 14 prison warders be charged with assault. These men were suspended from duty in December 1975; all 14 were found not guilty of 90 separate charges of misconduct and assault on 15 July 1976.)\n\n===Second IRA statement===\nD\u00e1ith\u00ed \u00d3 Conaill, then a member of the Provisional IRA's Army Council, had four days before the Birmingham pub bombings issued a statement declaring that the \"consequences of war\" would incessantly be felt not only in Northern Ireland, but on the British mainland, until the British government announced their intentions to \"disengage from Ireland\". One week after the Birmingham Six had been charged with the murder of Jane Davis, \u00d3 Conaill issued a further statement emphasising that none of the Birmingham Six had ever been members of the IRA. \u00d3 Conaill further stated:\n\n\n\n===Committal hearing===\nAt a committal hearing in May 1975, each man was formally charged with 21 counts of murder, with additional charges of conspiracy to cause explosions. Due to the wave of public outrage towards the perpetrators of the Birmingham pub bombings within the Midlands, Judge Bridge conceded to defence motions to move the trial away from the Midlands, and the trial was set to be heard within the Shire Hall and Crown Court of Lancaster Castle the following month. Also to stand trial with the Birmingham Six were three men: Mick Murray (a known member of the Provisional IRA who had previously been convicted of a separate charge of conspiracy to cause explosions), James Francis Gavin (a.k.a. James Kelly, who had likewise been tried alongside the Birmingham Six and convicted of the possession of explosives), who had allegedly constructed each of the bombs, and Michael Sheehan. Murray was also charged with conspiracy to cause explosions across the Midlands, with Kelly and Sheehan charged with possession of explosives.\n\nPrior to the trial, defence lawyers for the Birmingham Six applied for their clients to be tried separately from Sheehan, Kelly and, particularly, Murray, stating that their clients' presumptions of innocence and denials of association with the IRA would be tainted if they were tried alongside an admitted member of the Provisional IRA, who had been convicted of causing explosions. This application was rejected by Judge Bridge, who was to preside over the trial.\n\n\n==Trial==\nOn 9 June 1975, the Birmingham Six stood trial at Lancaster Crown Court before Judge Nigel Bridge. Each man was charged with 21 counts of murder and conspiring with the deceased James McDade to cause explosions across the Midlands between August and November 1974. Murray, Kelly and Sheehan were also charged with conspiracy to cause explosions across the Midlands, with Kelly and Sheehan facing the additional charges of possession of explosives.\n\nAll six men emphatically maintained their innocence, stating they had never been members of the IRA; that they had not known James McDade had been a member of the Provisional Irish Republican Army until his death; and reiterating their earlier claims of having been subject to intense physical and psychological abuse upon their arrest. Sheehan and Kelly also denied the charges brought against them, with Murray simply refusing to acknowledge or speak throughout the entire proceedings. (No direct evidence was offered to link Murray, Sheehan or Kelly with the Birmingham pub bombings. Nonetheless, the Crown alleged they were part of the same IRA unit as the Birmingham Six, and contended the Birmingham pub bombs may have been planted \"in some illogical way\" to avenge or commemorate the death of James McDade.)\n\nThe primary evidence presented against the Birmingham Six linking them to the Birmingham pub bombings were their written confessions, the Griess tests conducted by Frank Skuse at Morecambe police station, and circumstantial evidence indicative of Irish republican sympathies which would be supported by character witnesses called to testify on behalf of the prosecution.\n\nSkuse testified as to his conducting Griess tests upon the hands of the six men following their arrest, stating as to his being 99% certain that both Hill and Power had handled explosive materials, and to a possibility Walker may also have done so. Skuse conceded that he could not rule out the possibility that Walker's right hand could have been contaminated from his (Skuse's) own hands, as Walker was the last of the five men to be swabbed at Morecambe police station, and had at first tested negative to the Griess test, before a second swab had revealed faint, positive traces of ammonium and nitrates. This testimony was refuted by Dr. Hugh Kenneth Black, a former Chief Inspector of Explosives for the Home Office, who testified that a range of innocuous substances and objects one could handle on a daily basis containing nitrocellulose (such as varnishes and paints) would produce a positive result to a Griess test. Moreover, the tests conducted by Skuse had not succeeded in identifying nitroglycerine as the source of the positive results produced by the Griess tests, and the Crown had earlier conceded that an exhaustive search of the six men's homes had revealed no traces of nitroglycerine.\n\nSeveral weeks into the trial, Judge Bridge overruled motions from the defence counsel that the four written confessions obtained from their clients should be omitted from evidence due to their being extorted under extreme physical and mental pressure, instead citing the statements as admissible evidence. These written confessions were presented in evidence at the trial following an eight-day hearing conducted without the presence of the jury. The judge refused to allow the jury to view the written confessions, which would have disclosed not only that each of the four written confessions contradicted details contained within the three other confessions, but that they also contradicted testimony from forensic scientists delivered earlier in the trial as to the devices used to conceal the bombs, and the locations in which they had been placed inside the public houses. For example, William Power had claimed in his written confession that he had placed the bomb which devastated the Mulberry Bush public house by a jukebox at the foot of a staircase to the premises; whereas a forensic scientist named Douglas Higgs had testified on the fourth day of the trial that the bomb which had detonated within these premises had been left by a wall located towards the rear of the premises.\n\n===Conviction===\nThe trial lasted 45 days, and saw one hundred witnesses testify on behalf of the prosecution and defence. On 14 August 1975, the jury retired to consider their verdicts. These deliberations continued until the following day. On the afternoon of 15 August, having deliberated for over six-and-a-half hours, the jury returned unanimous guilty verdicts in relation to the 21 murder charges against the Birmingham Six. Upon passing sentence, Judge Nigel Bridge informed the defendants: \"You stand convicted of each of 21 counts, on the clearest and most overwhelming evidence I have ever heard, of the crime of murder.\" All six men were sentenced to life imprisonment. None of the Birmingham Six displayed any emotion upon hearing the verdict, although William Power saluted the judge.\n\nAt the same trial, Michael Murray and Michael Sheehan were each convicted of conspiracy to cause explosions and sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. James Kelly was found not guilty of conspiracy to cause explosions, but guilty of the possession of explosives and sentenced to one year's imprisonment; his counsel, Edwin Jowett, successfully argued that his client had already served the equivalent of a one-year sentence, and he was released from prison on 23 August.\n\nAfter sentencing all nine defendants, Judge Bridge summoned the Chief Constable of Lancashire and the Assistant Chief Constable of the West Midlands to hear a final address; both were commended for their collective efforts in interrogating and obtaining the four confessions presented in evidence. In addressing the defendants' assertions as to physical and psychological abuse while in the custody of both constabularies, Judge Bridge concluded: \"These investigations both at Morecambe and Birmingham were carried out with scrupulous propriety by all your officers\".\n\n==Appeals and independent reviews==\nFollowing their conviction, the Birmingham Six continued to steadfastly maintain their innocence. All six men submitted an application to appeal their convictions; this motion was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in March 1976. Two years later, in November 1978, the Birmingham Six were granted legal aid to sue the Lancashire and West Midlands Police forces, and the Home Office, through the Court of Appeal in relation to the injuries they had suffered in custody. This motion to appeal their convictions on these grounds was challenged by the West Midlands Police, and was stricken by Lord Denning in January 1980, thereby thwarting the attempts of the men to find legal redress for their grievances via these grounds. The Birmingham Six were initially refused permission to further appeal against their convictions. The following year, Patrick Hill embarked on a month-long hunger strike in an unsuccessful bid to have his case reopened.\n\nIn 1982, Patrick Hill was visited by civil rights lawyer Gareth Peirce, who agreed to act on his behalf. Peirce also encouraged Hill and his co-accused to continue to compile evidence attesting to their innocence and to write to media personnel such as journalist Chris Mullin, and politicians such as Sir John Farr in an effort to garner support for a review of their case. Farr responded to this correspondence in March 1983, and later thoroughly reviewed all documents relating to the men's conviction, concluding that the forensic evidence which existed against the six men was \"not worth the paper it was written on\".\n\nIn 1985, the current affairs news programme World in Action presented the first of six episodes focusing upon the Birmingham pub bombings which seriously challenged the validity of the convictions of the six men. In this first episode broadcast, two distinguished forensic scientists conducted a series of Griess tests upon 35 separate common substances which the men had likely come into contact within their everyday lives.\n\nEach forensic scientist confirmed that only substances containing nitrocellulose produced a positive result, and that the Griess test would only produce a positive reaction to nitrocellulose if conducted in a room at typical room temperature. When asked to comment on testimony delivered at the trial of the Birmingham Six, in which Dr. Skuse had stated that the temperature in a room in which the Griess test was conducted would need to be heated to 60\u00a0\u00b0C to produce a false positive reaction to nitrocellulose (thereby confusing the reading with nitroglycerine), one of the forensic scientists stated, \"Frankly, I was amazed.\"\n\nAlso appearing on this first World in Action episode broadcast was a former West Midlands policeman, who confirmed that each of the Birmingham Six had been subjected to beatings and threats while in the custody of the West Midlands Crime Squad. In addition, a former IRA Chief of Staff, Joe Cahill, on the same programme, acknowledged the IRA's role in the Birmingham pub bombings.\n\nIn 1986, British Labour politician and journalist Chris Mullin published Error of Judgement: Truth About the Birmingham Bombings, which provided further evidence that the men had been wrongly convicted. The book included anonymous interviews with some of those who claimed to have been involved in the bombings, and who claimed the protocol 30-minute warning bomb warning had been delayed because the preselected telephone box had been vandalised, and that by the time another telephone box was found, the advance warning had been significantly delayed.\n\n===1987 Court of Appeal hearing===\nIn January 1987, the Home Office referred the conviction of the Birmingham Six to the Court of Appeal. This motion resulted from the findings of forensic scientists working for the Home Office, who had expressed grave concerns as to the reliability of the Griess tests cited as forensic evidence of the defendants' guilt. In granting this motion, the Home Secretary himself emphasised that he had \"little or no confidence\" in the reliability of this test. This appeal was heard before three judges of the Court of Appeal in November 1987.\n\nAt this hearing, the defence counsels argued that the Birmingham Six were victims of a gross miscarriage of justice, that they had been convicted upon unreliable forensic evidence, and that the signed confessions were contradictory and had been obtained under extreme physical and mental duress. The allegations of physical mistreatment were corroborated by a former policeman named Thomas Clarke, who testified as to the defendants' mistreatment while incarcerated at Winson Green Prison.\n\nThis appeal also heard evidence from Mullin, who testified in detail as to the contradictions in the written and verbal confessions obtained from the defendants, both with regards to the events of the day, and with regards to the content of the statements made by their fellow defendants\u2014all purported by the Crown to be solid evidence. Mullin also testified as to the fundamental flaws in the forensic tests conducted upon the men's hands for traces of nitroglycerine.\n\nThis evidence was contradicted by Igor Judge, QC, who informed the three judges of the Court of Appeal of the Crown's allegations that police had obtained false confessions by subjecting the men to severe physical and emotional abuse was \"baseless\", and of his belief that only film footage of the defendants planting the bombs would provide stronger evidence than that which already existed against the Birmingham Six. On 28 January 1988, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales again upheld the convictions of the Birmingham Six as safe.\n\n===Further media exposure===\nIn March 1990, ITV broadcast the Granada Television documentary drama, Who Bombed Birmingham?; a drama which recounted the events of the arrest of the Birmingham Six, the evidence presented at the trial and Mullins' then-ongoing efforts to prove Birmingham Six had been the victims of a miscarriage of justice. This documentary drama extensively detailed both the flaws in the forensic evidence against the men, and the extensive physical and psychological abuse to which they had been subjected. The programme named four of five members of the Provisional IRA as having organised and committed the Birmingham pub bombings.\n\nOne of these men was Mick Murray, who had been tried alongside the Birmingham Six and convicted of conspiracy to cause explosions. Murray was named as having assisted in the selection of the targets, and had later placed the advance warning call to the Birmingham Post and Birmingham Evening Mail newspapers, which was delayed by a half-hour due to the fact that the pre-selected telephone had been vandalised and another needed to be located, leading to the fateful delay in the warning calls. The other three named in the documentary were Seamus McLoughlin, whom the programme asserted had also planned the atrocities; James Francis Gavin (a.k.a. James Kelly, who had likewise been tried alongside the Birmingham Six and convicted of the possession of explosives), who had allegedly constructed each of the bombs; and Michael Christopher Hayes, who had planted the bombs at the preselected locations.\n\nThe executive producer of Who Bombed Birmingham?, Ray Fitzwalter, has stated that those involved in the production of this documentary drama are 100 percent certain that those named as the perpetrators of the Birmingham pub bombings had committed the atrocities. (When broadcast in Ireland, the caption before the credits where these names were given was redacted.)\n\n\n==Release==\nOn 29 August 1990, as a result of further fresh evidence uncovered following the 1988 dismissal of appeal, the Home Secretary again referred the convictions of the Birmingham Six to the Court of Appeal. This appeal was heard by Lord Justice Lloyd between 4 and 14 March 1991. At the conclusion of this second appeal, the convictions of the Birmingham Six were quashed upon the bases of police fabrication of evidence, the suppression of evidence, and the unreliability of the scientific evidence presented at their 1975 trial. The tests conducted by Skuse upon the defendants' hands for nitroglycerine were deemed by the three Court of Appeal judges as being particularly unreliable and \"demonstrably wrong ... even by the state of forensic science in 1974\".\n\nThe discrediting of this evidence was sufficient for the Crown to dismiss pleas from the prosecution to find the convictions \"unsatisfactory but not unsafe\". On the afternoon of 14 March, Lord Justice Lloyd announced his intentions to withdraw the Crown's case against the defendants. Upon announcing his intention to withdraw the convictions, Lord Justice Lloyd informed the Birmingham Six: \"In the light of the fresh evidence which has been made available since the last hearing in this court, your appeals will be allowed and you are free to go.\"\n\nEmerging from the Old Bailey to an ecstatic public reception, each of the men addressed the press and public with varying statements.\n\nIn 2001, each of the Birmingham Six was subsequently paid between \u00a3840,000 and \u00a31.2million in compensation.\n\n\n==Renewed inquests==\nThe West Midlands Police and then-Director of Public Prosecutions, Dame Barbara Mills, reopened their investigation into the Birmingham pub bombings following the release of the Birmingham Six. In April 1994, the Chief Constable of the West Midlands, Ron Hadfield, publicly stated: \"The file, so far as we are concerned is now closed ... We have done everything we could possibly have done to bring the perpetrators to justice\". Hadfield then emphasised that the Director of Public Prosecutions had found \"insufficient evidence for [criminal] proceedings to be taken\".\n\nAt the conclusion of the 1994 investigation, the Director of Public Prosecutions implemented a 75-year public-interest immunity certificate on documents relating to the Birmingham pub bombings\u2014effectively preventing any release of documents relating to the reinvestigation until 2069. This court order forbids the disclosure of this evidence to the public on the grounds that any disclosure would be deemed to be damaging to the public interest.\n\nOn 1 June 2016, the senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull, Louise Hunt, announced renewed inquests into the Birmingham pub bombings, citing two occasions where evidence clearly indicated the West Midlands Police had received a minimum of two advance warnings of the impending attacks at the two pubs\u2014one of which had been made by known IRA members who had unequivocally stated on 10 November that Birmingham was to be \"hit next week\". This conversation had been reported to police; no evidence is known to exist the West Midlands Police had taken any effective responsive action to this threat. A second warning had been given to police on the day of the bombings, yet no action is known to have been taken.\n\nAlthough Hunt states that any claims that police were\/are protecting an IRA mole are unfounded, and that the response of emergency services on the night of the blasts did not in any way contribute to the deaths, in one section of her report, she states: \"I have serious concerns that advanced notice of the bombs may have been available to the police, and that they failed to take the necessary steps to protect public life.\"\n\nIn September 2018, the Lord Chief Justice ruled that any suspects in the bombings were not due to be named at upcoming inquests into the bombings, the judges present at the hearing having upheld an earlier coroner's decision to omit issues pertaining to responsibility for the bombings in these inquests. The renewed inquests commenced on 11 February 2019.\n\nWith permission from the current head of the IRA, an individual known only as \"Witness O\" testified at this inquest on 22 March, naming four men (one of whom was Mick Murray) as responsible for the bombings. He also testified as to his belief that security services had been given adequate time to evacuate both pubs. On 5 April, the jury of 11 found that a botched advance IRA telephone warning contributed to or caused the 21 deaths and that there had been no error or omission in the police response to the given warning call which might have limited the loss of life.\n\n\n\n==Independent campaign==\nIn 2011, Brian and Julie Hambleton, who lost their 18-year-old sister Maxine in the Tavern in the Town explosion, initiated a campaign called Justice for the 21. The stated aims of this campaign are to highlight and resolve the fact that, although the inquiry is officially an open one, no efforts are being made to actively pursue the perpetrators of the Birmingham pub bombings unless significant new leads are to surface, and to resolve the issue that the families of the 21 victims have never seen true justice for the loss of their loved ones. Justice for the 21 wants to see the criminal investigation into the bombings reopened and the perpetrators brought to justice or, if deceased, publicly named. When asked in 2012 why she and her brother had instigated this campaign, Julie Hambleton stated: \"Someone has to fight for them; someone has to speak on their behalf, because they're not here to do it themselves ... It doesn't matter how much time has passed.\"\n\nCampaigners for Justice for the 21 believe they have amassed evidence indicating that a British double agent was part of an IRA unit that had committed the pub bombings.\n\nFollowing a 2014 meeting held at the West Midlands Police headquarters to discuss the findings of a two-year reassessment of all available evidence connected with the original 1974 inquiry, campaigners within Justice for the 21 were informed that unless \"new and significant information\" was forthcoming, there would be no further inquiry into the Birmingham pub bombings. At this meeting, the Chief Constable of the West Midlands informed the campaigners that 35 pieces of evidence from the original 1974 inquiry were now missing, including the bomb which had been discovered at Hagley Road and safely destroyed in a controlled explosion.\n\nIn November 2014, the Justice for the 21 campaign implemented a fresh petition to pressure the British Government to form a new inquiry into the Birmingham pub bombings. This petition was signed by four retired West Midlands Police officers, and by Patrick Hill, who wrote of his desire that a fresh inquiry would \"establish the true circumstances of the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings, and to order the release of all government, police, and Crown papers related to the case in order to bring truth and justice for the 21 innocent people who died, the 182 people who were injured, for the six innocent men who were wrongfully convicted, and for the families of all those affected.\"\n\nPatrick Hill has publicly backed the efforts of the Justice for the 21 campaign, and would later state that, following their 1991 release from prison, the Birmingham Six had been informed of the names of the true perpetrators of the Birmingham pub bombings and that their identities are known among the upper echelons of both the IRA and the British government. Hill stated that, following the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, he has been told that five members of the Provisional IRA have admitted to committing the Birmingham pub bombings, relying on a clause in the Good Friday Agreement offering immunity from prosecution. Two of these men have since died and a further two have been promised immunity, whereas a fifth man reportedly had not received any such assurances.\n\n\n==Aftermath==\n* In the weeks and months following the Birmingham pub bombings, Birmingham's Irish community experienced ostracism, assault and abuse. As a result of these tensions, any public celebrations of Irish culture, including the annual St Patrick's Day Parade, were cancelled. Tensions created in the wake of the bombings would take more than a decade to heal.\n* In 1983, the Director of the Birmingham Irish Welfare and Information Centre, Rev. Joe Taaffe, reinstated Birmingham's annual St Patrick's Day Parade, with a message that the Irish community in Birmingham should again unashamedly celebrate their heritage without fear of reprisal. Birmingham's annual St Patrick's Day Parade is considered to be the world's third largest St Patrick's Day Parade, with annual attendance figures reaching or surpassing 130,000.\n* Following his release from prison in 1991, Patrick Hill co-founded of the Miscarriages of Justice Organisation; a group whose dual aims are to provide and improve emotional and physical support for those found to have been wrongly convicted once released from prison, and to provide advocacy for those still inside prison who proclaim their innocence. Patrick Hill and the families of those killed in the Birmingham pub bombings remain united in their efforts to overturn the 75-year public interest immunity order imposed in 1994, and have publicly demanded the British Government order the release of all government, police, and crown papers related to the case. In reference to the public interest immunity order, a spokeswoman for the Justice for the 21 campaign group commented in 2014:\n\n\n\n\n* In 2004, civil rights campaigner and Catholic priest Rev Denis Faul (who had previously campaigned for the release of the Birmingham Six) officially called on the IRA to both admit their culpability in the Birmingham pub bombings, and to apologise. These calls were echoed by Sinn F\u00e9in, who stated: \"What happened in Birmingham 30 years ago was wrong and should not have happened\", adding \"[if] issues relating to the IRA concerning the Birmingham bombings are still to be addressed, then it is very clearly the Sinn F\u00e9in position that this should happen\".\n* In 2014, the Birmingham Mail named Michael Murray as the mastermind behind the Birmingham pub bombings. Murray was an admitted member of the Provisional IRA who held a high rank within the Birmingham IRA unit; he had been arrested just four days after the Birmingham pub bombings and had stood trial alongside the Birmingham Six, and although charged only with conspiracy to cause explosions, the prosecutor had suggested Murray may have been the mastermind behind the bombings. Prior to his 1975 trial, Murray had been convicted of separate charges of conspiracy to cause explosions and with causing an explosion.\n* The Birmingham Mail alleges Murray had assisted in the construction of the bombs at a house in Bordesley Green, and had then transported them to the city centre, where he had handed them to another person, who then placed them in the preselected targets, before Murray telephoned the delayed warning calls to the two Birmingham newspapers. These allegations are supported by Patrick Hill and John Walker, who remain adamant that at one stage during the 1975 trial, Murray had privately admitted being one of the bombers. Murray allegedly told the two men: \"I'm very sorry to see yous in here. Nothing went right that night. The first telephone box we got to was out of order\", before threatening the two men that if they ever divulged this admission, both they and their families would be attacked.\n* Mick Murray never admitted his alleged involvement in the Birmingham pub bombings. Following his release from prison, he remained active within the Provisional IRA, and later became a vocal opponent of the decommissioning in Northern Ireland as part of the Northern Ireland peace process. He died of a heart attack in County Tipperary in 1999.\n* Kieran Conway, a former senior officer of the Provisional Irish Republican Army, admitted in 2014 the PIRA had committed the Birmingham pub bombings, adding that he was \"appalled and ashamed\" at the attack, and that other senior IRA officials shared his opinion the bombings had been immoral and detrimental to the objectives of the republican movement. Conway, however, disputed allegations that an insufficient warning had deliberately been given to security services due to ill-feeling within the IRA over the disrupted funeral arrangements for James McDade, but claimed the perpetrators had tried to use several phone boxes which were either out of order or in use to deliver the protocol 30-minute warning, before finding a free, operable phone box to deliver the warning call.\n* On 10 July 2017, BBC Northern Ireland radio released an interview with Michael Christopher Hayes, a self-confessed bomb maker active within the Birmingham IRA unit in the 1970s. In this interview, Hayes (who had been named as a perpetrator of the bombings in the 1990 Granada documentary drama Who Bombed Birmingham?) stated he took \"collective responsibility\" for the bombings, although he refused to name who had planted the bombs in each of the locations. Nonetheless, he did state: \"We were horrified when we heard, because it was not intended. I personally defused the third bomb. It was not the intention of the IRA to kill innocent people ... It wouldn't have been done if that was the case.\"\n\n\n==Memorials==\nA memorial plaque for the victims stands in the grounds of Birmingham's Saint Philip's Cathedral. This plaque is engraved with the names of the 21 people killed in the Birmingham pub bombings, and bears the inscription: \"The people of Birmingham remember them and those who suffered.\"\n\nA memorial commemorating those lost and wounded in the Birmingham pub bombings was unveiled on 21 November 2018. Commissioned by the Birmingham Irish Association and designed by a local artist named Anuradha Patel, this memorial consists of three steel trees, and is located outside the city's New Street Station.\n\nSeveral survivors and relatives of those killed in the Birmingham pub bombings have visited the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation in the Republic of Ireland in an effort to come to terms with the events of 21 November 1974. The Glencree Centre is a charitable organisation whose stated aim is to promote peace and reconciliation in Britain and Ireland as a response to the Troubles. One of those who has visited the Glencree Centre, Maureen Carlin (who survived the Mulbery Bush bombing), said in 2009 that she had spoken with two former IRA members, who referred to the Birmingham pub bombings as a mistake for which the IRA would never publicly admit responsibility.\n\n==Media==\n\n\n===Film===\nThe made-for-TV film Who Bombed Birmingham? was first broadcast in 1990. Directed by Mike Beckham, the film is directly inspired by the painstaking efforts of then-journalist Chris Mullin to prove the six men convicted of the bombing had been the victims of a miscarriage of justice, as detailed in his 1986 book Error of Judgement: The Truth about the Birmingham Bombings. The film casts John Hurt as Mullin and Martin Shaw as Granada Television World in Action producer and fellow researcher Ian McBride, as they investigate the convictions of the \"Birmingham Six.\"\n\n===Books===\n* Encyclopedia of Modern Murder 1962\u20131982, by Colin Wilson\n* Error of Judgement: The Truth about the Birmingham Bombings, by Chris Mullin\n* Forever Lost, Forever Gone, by Patrick Hill\n* The Birmingham Bombs, by Brian Gibson\n* The Birmingham Six and Other Cases: Victims of Circumstance, by Louis Blom-Cooper\n\n===Television===\n* The British investigative current affairs programme World in Action has broadcast a total of six episodes focusing upon the Birmingham pub bombings between 1985 and 1991. The last of these episodes, World in Action Special: The Birmingham Six \u2013 Their Own Story, was broadcast on 18 March 1991\u2014four days after the release of the Birmingham Six\u2014and was later nominated for a BAFTA award.\n* The BBC have commissioned a 30-minute documentary focusing upon the Birmingham pub bombings. This documentary, Who Murdered Maxine?, was first broadcast in 2013 and focuses upon the ongoing campaign by relatives of one of those killed in the Birmingham pub bombings, Maxine Hambleton, to reopen the investigation into the bombings and their ongoing efforts to raise public awareness of their campaign.\n\n\n==See also==\n*Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions (1970\u201379)\n*List of miscarriage of justice cases\n\n==Notes==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n==Cited works and further reading==\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n== External links ==\n* 1974 BBC news article  describing the aftermath of the Birmingham pub bombings\n*  News article and image galleries relating to the Birmingham pub bombings\n*  Contemporary BBC news article detailing the arrest of the Birmingham Six\n*  Transcripts of the false confessions given by the Birmingham Six\n*  Contemporary BBC news article detailing the release of the Birmingham Six\n*  World In Action Special: The Birmingham Six \u2013 Their Own Story as broadcast on 18 March 1991\n*  Official website of the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation\n*  Justice for the 21: A website detailing the campaign by relatives of those killed in the Birmingham pub bombings for those responsible to be brought to trial\n*  Audio interview with Julie Hambleton detailing the resolve and obstacles the Justice for the 21 campaign has endured in their efforts to seek a fresh inquiry into the Birmingham pub bombings\n* A  personal account of the Birmingham pub bombings, written by a member of the West Midlands Fire Service\n* 2013 Birmingham Mail article detailing the  renovation of the memorial to the victims of the Birmingham pub bombings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Street in central Birmingham facing the cylindrical Rotunda.

{"title":"Guildford pub bombings","article":"The Guildford pub bombings occurred on 5 October 1974 when a subgroup of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) detonated two 6-pound gelignite bombs at two pubs in Guildford, Surrey, England. The pubs were targeted because they were popular with British Army personnel stationed at Pirbright barracks. Four soldiers and one civilian were killed. Sixty-five people were wounded.\n\nThe bomb in the Horse and Groom detonated at 8:30 pm. It killed Paul Craig (a 22-year-old plasterer), two members of the Scots Guards and two members of the Women's Royal Army Corps. The Seven Stars was evacuated after the first blast causing no serious injuries to any customers when the second bomb exploded at 9:00 pm. However the owner of the Seven Stars pub Owen O'Brien and his wife looked for a second device in their pub. When the second explosion occurred O'Brien sustained a fractured skull and his wife a broken leg. Five members of staff and one customer who had just stepped outside when the blast happened received less serious injuries.\n\nThese attacks were the first in a year-long campaign by an IRA Active Service Unit who became known as the Balcombe Street Gang \u2013 who police arrested in December 1975 after the Balcombe Street siege leading to their trial and conviction for other murders and offences. A similar bomb to those used in Guildford, with the addition of shrapnel, was thrown into the Kings Arms pub in Woolwich on 7 November 1974. Gunner Richard Dunne and Alan Horsley, a sales clerk, died in that explosion. On August 27, 1975 the same IRA unit detonated a bomb in Surrey at the Caterham Arms pub which injured over 30 people, Surrey police said it was \"a carbon copy of the Guildford bombs\". \n\nThe bombings contributed to the speedy and unchallenged passing of the Prevention of Terrorism Acts in November 1974, which were then misused by the Metropolitan Police to force false confessions from the \"Guildford Four\".\n\n==The Guildford Four==\nThe bombings were at the height of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The Metropolitan Police were under enormous pressure to apprehend the IRA bombers responsible for the attacks in England. In December 1974 the police arrested three men and a woman, later known as the Guildford Four. They were Gerry Conlon, Paul Hill, Patrick Armstrong and Carole Richardson.\n\nConlon had been in London at the time of the bombings, and had visited his mother's sister, Annie Maguire. A few days after the Guildford Four were arrested, the Metropolitan Police arrested Annie Maguire and her family, including Gerry Conlon's father, Patrick \"Giuseppe\" Conlon \u2013 the \"Maguire Seven\".\n\nThe Guildford Four were falsely convicted of the bombings in October 1975 and sentenced to life in prison. The Maguire Seven were falsely convicted of providing bomb-making material and other support in March 1976 and sentenced to terms varying between four and fourteen years.\n\nThe Guildford Four were held in prison for fifteen years, while Giuseppe Conlon died near the end of his third year of imprisonment. All the convictions were overturned years later in the appeal courts after it was proved the Guildford Four's convictions had been based on confessions obtained by torture (as were some Maguire Seven confessions), whilst evidence specifically clearing the Four was not reported by the police. \n\nDuring the trial of the \"Balcombe Street Four\" in February 1977, the four IRA members instructed their lawyers to \"draw attention to the fact that four totally innocent people were serving massive sentences\" for three bombings in Woolwich and Guildford. The Balcombe Street Four were never charged with these offences.

{"title":"M62 coach bombing","article":"The M62 coach bombing occurred on 4 February 1974 on the M62 motorway in northern England, when a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) bomb exploded in a coach carrying off-duty British Armed Forces personnel and their family members. Twelve people (nine soldiers, three civilians) were killed by the bomb, which consisted of  of high explosive hidden in a luggage locker on the coach. Later in 1974 Judith Ward was convicted of the crime, but 18 years later the conviction was judged as wrongful and she was released from prison.\n\n==The bombing==\n\nThe coach had been specially commissioned to carry British Army and Royal Air Force personnel on leave with their families from and to the bases at Catterick and Darlington during a period of railway strike action. The vehicle had departed from Manchester and was making good progress along the motorway. Shortly after midnight, when the bus was between junction 26 and 27, near Oakwell Hall, there was a large explosion on board. Most of those aboard were sleeping at the time. The blast, which could be heard several miles away, reduced the coach to a \"tangle of twisted metal\" and threw body parts up to .\n\nThe explosion killed eleven people outright and wounded over fifty others, one of whom died four days later. Amongst the dead were nine soldiers \u2013 two from the Royal Artillery, three from the Royal Corps of Signals and four from the 2nd Battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. One of the latter was Corporal Clifford Haughton, whose entire family, consisting of his wife Linda and his sons Lee (5) and Robert (2), also were killed. Numerous others suffered severe injuries, including a six-year-old boy, who was badly burned. \n\nThe driver of the coach, Roland Handley, was injured by flying glass, but was hailed as a hero for bringing the coach safely to a halt. Handley died, aged 76, in January 2012.\n\nSuspicions immediately fell upon the IRA, which was in the midst of an armed campaign in Britain involving numerous operations, later including the Guildford pub bombing and the Birmingham pub bombings.\n\n===Reaction===\n\n\nReactions in Britain were furious, with senior politicians from all parties calling for immediate action against the perpetrators and the IRA in general.\nThe British media were equally condemnatory; according to The Guardian, it was \"the worst IRA outrage on the British mainland\" at that time, whilst the BBC has described it as \"one of the IRA's worst mainland terror attacks\".  Irish newspaper The Sunday Business Post later described it as the \"worst\" of the \"awful atrocities perpetrated by the IRA\" during this period.\n\nIRA Army Council member D\u00e1ith\u00ed \u00d3 Conaill was challenged over the bombing and the death of civilians during an interview, and replied that the coach was bombed because IRA intelligence indicated that it was carrying military personnel only.\n\nThe attack's most lasting consequence was the adoption of much stricter 'anti-terrorism' laws in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, allowing police to hold those 'suspected of terrorism' for up to seven days without charge, and to deport those 'suspected of terrorism' in Britain or the Republic of Ireland to Northern Ireland to face trial, where special courts judged with separate rules on 'terrorism' suspects.\n\nThe entrance hall of the westbound section of the Hartshead Moor service area was used as a first aid station for those wounded in the blast. A memorial to those who were killed was later created there.  Following a campaign by relatives of the dead, a larger memorial was later erected, set some yards away from the entrance hall. The site, situated behind four flag poles, includes an English oak tree, a memorial stone, a memorial plaque and a raised marble tablet inscribed with the names of those who died. A memorial plaque engraved with the names of the casualties was also unveiled in Oldham in 2010. The Haughton family are buried in Blackley Cemetery, Manchester.\n\n== Prosecution of Judith Ward ==\n\nFollowing the explosion, the British public and politicians from all three major parties called for \"swift justice\". The ensuing police investigation led by Detective Chief Superintendent George Oldfield was rushed, careless and ultimately forged, resulting in the arrest of the mentally ill Judith Ward (born 10 January 1949). Ward claimed to have conducted a string of bombings in Britain in 1973 and 1974 and to have married and had a baby with two separate IRA members. Despite her subsequent retraction of these claims, the lack of any corroborating evidence against her, and serious gaps in her testimony\u00a0\u2013 which was frequently rambling, incoherent and \"improbable\"\u00a0\u2013 she was wrongfully convicted in November 1974. Following her conviction, the Irish Republican Publicity Bureau issued a statement:\n\nMiss Ward was not a member of \u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann and was not used in any capacity by the organisation. She had nothing to do what-so-ever with the military coach bomb (on 4 February 1974), the bombing of Euston Station and the attack on Latimer Military College. Those acts were authorised operations carried out by units of the Irish Republican Army.\n\nThe case against her was almost completely based on inaccurate scientific evidence using the Griess test and deliberate manipulation of her confession by some members of the investigating team. The case was similar to those of the Guildford Four, the Birmingham Six and the Maguire Seven, which occurred at the same time and involved similar forged confessions and inaccurate scientific analysis. Ward was finally released in May 1992, when three Appeal Court judges held unanimously that her conviction was \"a grave miscarriage of justice\", and that it had been \"secured by ambush\".\n\n==Notes==\n\n\n==Further reading==\n*\n*\n\n==External links==\n\n* BBC On this Day Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlaque unveiled in Oldham in 2010 in memory of the victims of the bombing.\nMemorial plaque at Hartshead Moor services.\nSecond memorial at Hartshead Moor services.\nHaughton family grave, Blackley Cemetery.","urls":["http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/cgi-bin\/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&day=4&month=02&year=1974","http:\/\/www.examiner.co.uk\/news\/tributes-paid-m62-coach-bomb-6661977","http:\/\/www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk\/news\/greater-manchester-news\/hero-driver-of-m62-coach-bombing-1280524","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/crime\/article\/0,2763,634024,0.html","http:\/\/archives.tcm.ie\/businesspost\/2003\/12\/14\/story198885913.asp","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20070926222352\/http:\/\/archives.tcm.ie\/businesspost\/2003\/12\/14\/story198885913.asp","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/bradford\/content\/articles\/2006\/11\/29\/m62_bombing_feature.shtml","http:\/\/findarticles.com\/p\/articles\/mi_6784\/is_2008_Dec_29\/ai_n31153139","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/england\/west_yorkshire\/7530833.stm","http:\/\/www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk\/news\/4101758.New_memorial_unveiled_to_bus_bomb_victims\/","http:\/\/www.examiner.co.uk\/news\/west-yorkshire-news\/m62-coach-bombing-victims-remembered-8557217","https:\/\/books.google.co.uk\/books?id=22Bvs_DkOXcC&pg=PA247","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/onthisday\/hi\/dates\/stories\/february\/4\/newsid_4148000\/4148933.stm"]}

The bomb had been placed in the fifth passenger car of the train and exploded at 01:23. Under its own momentum, the train reached the end of the tunnel.

They received the order from the Italian fascist terrorist organizations Fronte Nazionale Rivoluzionario (\"revolutionary national front\") and Ordine Nuovo.\n\nAt the time, police and intelligence knew that Tuti was a subversive.

{"title":"Cafeter\u00eda Rolando bombing","article":"The Cafeter\u00eda Rolando bombing was an attack on 13 September 1974 at the Rolando cafe in Calle del Correo, Madrid, Spain which killed 13 people and wounded 71. Though no claim of responsibility was made, the attack is widely believed to have been carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA.\n\n==Background==\nThe Rolando Cafe was located on 4 Calle del Correo in Madrid, close to the General Directorate of Security, the headquarters of the Spanish Police. It was regularly frequented by members of the police force and security services.\n\n==The attack==\nThe bomb was placed at the entrance to the building and exploded on a Friday afternoon, during a busy lunchtime period. More than 300 people were eating in the neighbouring El Tobogan restaurant at the time of the explosion, two of whom were among the dead. The explosion caused significant damage to nearby buildings, shattering the windows of the nearby General Directorate of Security, while two cars parked nearby were totally destroyed. The bomb caused part of the Rolando Cafe's ceiling to collapse and guests staying in a pension above were injured due to falling through the gaps in the ceiling. The police immediately arrived and cordoned off the scene.\n\nTwo of the 12 initially killed and 11 of the injured were members of the police force. However the wounded included the number two of the Spanish Political Police, with the remainder employees and customers of the cafe. A thirteenth victim died in 1977 of injuries suffered during the attack.\n\n==Responses and arrests==\nThe leadership of ETA was taken aback by the responses to the attack and on 15 September, issued a statement denying their responsibility, though implicitly defending the bombing, claiming that the cafe was full of police agents. This caused tensions within the group, with some members believing that the organisation had to admit responsibility for attacks carried out, even if the results were not those intended. The bombing gave those opposed to further liberalisation of the country, such as Blas Pi\u00f1ar, the opportunity to attack the Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro.\n\nIn the immediate period of confusion following the attack, some blamed the attack on the far-right. The police, however, concluded that ETA were responsible and launched an operation against the group's infrastructure in Madrid. Initially the police also blamed the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) of cooperating in the attack, but the PCE energetically denied involvement. Reports that police officers had received a circular advising them not to go to the Rolando Cafe or stand outside the building added to the mystery surrounding the incident.\n\nLeftists known to be sympathetic to ETA were arrested, including Eva Forest, wife of the communist playwright Alfonso Sastre, Mari Luz Fernandez and her relatives, Lidia Falc\u00f3n, the theatre director Vicente Sainz de la Pe\u00f1a, construction worker Antonio Dur\u00e1n, pilot Bernardo Badell and his wife Mar\u00eda del Carmen Nadal, the actress Mar\u00eda Paz Ballesteros, and the writer Eliseo Bayo. Between June 1975 and February 1976, courts dismissed the cases and released the defendants. However Eva Forest and Mari Luz Fernandez remained in prison as they were charged with complicity in the assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco one year before. However, neither Forest nor Luz Fernandez were tried for the Rolando bombing, as they were released in June 1977 as part of a general amnesty for political prisoners. In 1981 Lidia Falc\u00f3n published a denunciation of Eva Forest which suggested that Forest's role in the Rolando attack had been considerable.\n\nThe government also offered a reward of one million pesetas for information leading to the capture of Juan Manuel Galarraga Mendizabal who they suspected of being a high ranking ETA figure involved in the bombing. Exact authorship of the bombing has however remained a mystery.\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/www.elpais.com\/articulo\/espana\/MADRID\/MADRID_\/MUNICIPIO\/Atentado\/calle\/Correo\/caso\/similar\/todavia\/aclarado\/elpepiesp\/19790527elpepinac_7\/Tes","https:\/\/hemeroteca.abc.es\/nav\/Navigate.exe\/hemeroteca\/madrid\/abc\/1988\/06\/07\/025.html","https:\/\/archive.is\/20121027071917\/http:\/\/hemeroteca.abc.es\/nav\/Navigate.exe\/hemeroteca\/madrid\/abc\/1988\/06\/07\/025.html","http:\/\/www.diariodenavarra.es\/20110110\/nacional\/documentacion-historia-eta-casi-900-muertos-medio-siglo-terror.html?not=2011011012491732&idnot=2011011012491732&dia=20110110&seccion=nacional&seccion2=terrorismo&chnl=30","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110720140212\/http:\/\/www.diariodenavarra.es\/20110110\/nacional\/documentacion-historia-eta-casi-900-muertos-medio-siglo-terror.html?not=2011011012491732&idnot=2011011012491732&dia=20110110&seccion=nacional&seccion2=terrorismo&chnl=30","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=9oEacwj7ViYC&pg=PA50&dq=eta+cafeteria+rolando&hl=en&ei=41BzTa-eBYrCswbd6s34AQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=FfKkhaQ_vV4C&pg=PA162&dq=cafeteria+rolando+ataque+eta&hl=en&ei=VplyTeeUGIzBswa0xZWEDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ","http:\/\/hemeroteca.lavanguardia.es\/preview\/1974\/09\/14\/pagina-3\/34263319\/pdf.html","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=n6-7u0RneKYC&pg=PA49&dq=eta+cafeteria+rolando&hl=en&ei=7VFzTaCJEs7ysgaWgYmEDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/news\/2007\/jun\/06\/guardianobituaries.spain","http:\/\/hemeroteca.lavanguardia.es\/preview\/1974\/09\/15\/pagina-5\/34265703\/pdf.html"]}
{"title":"Caterham Arms pub bombing","article":"On 27 August 1975 a Provisional IRA bomb exploded without warning at the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey, England. There were no fatalities but 33 people were injured, some severely. Two off-duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing.\n\n==Background==\nIn February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office. Seven \"incident centres\" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces. Before the truce, the IRA active service unit (ASU) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang (due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London. Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974.\n\n==The bombing==\nThe Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9:20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off-duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign (Phase Two) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people.\n\n==Aftermath==\nOne of the police officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a \"carbon copy\" of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their sentences. The cell's campaign would continue until December 1975 when they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street. The unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in London and elsewhere in southern England and carrying out several shootings which, along with the bombings, caused the deaths of nearly 20 people, injured hundreds and caused millions of pounds worth of damage to property.\n\n==See also==\n*Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions (1970\u201379)\n\n== References ==","urls":["https:\/\/hansard.parliament.uk\/Commons\/1976-11-02\/debates\/e71e14a1-6288-409f-b591-f63144ff4ac7\/WrittenAnswers","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=7V61DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT142&lpg=PT142&dq=%22caterham%22+%22paul+thomas%22+leg","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/cgi-bin\/PRONI\/pronidbase.pl?field=doctype&martin=1&title=(25%20August%201975)&key=PRONI","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/cgi-bin\/PRONI\/pronidbase.pl?field=doctype&martin=1&title=(28%20August%201975)&key=PRONI"]}
{"title":"Dublin Airport bombing","article":"On 29 November 1975, a bomb exploded in the arrivals terminal of Dublin Airport, killing a man and injuring nine other people. The Ulster Defence Association (UDA), a loyalist paramilitary group from Northern Ireland, claimed responsibility for the bombing. It was one of a series of loyalist bomb attacks in the Republic of Ireland between the late 1960s and mid 1970s.\n\n==Background==\nLoyalists had been carrying out bomb attacks in the Republic of Ireland, mainly in Dublin, and in border counties Cavan, Donegal, Louth and Monaghan, since the beginning of the Troubles in August 1969. Several of these had resulted in fatalities. Three civilians were killed and almost 200 injured in the 1972 and 1973 Dublin bombings, while 34 civilians were killed in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in 1974, the deadliest attack of the Troubles.\n\n==The bombing==\nOn the afternoon of 29 November 1975, a bomb exploded in the public toilets in the arrivals terminal of Dublin Airport. It killed Aer Lingus worker John Hayes (38), who lived in Balbriggan, and injured nine others. According to bomb experts the bomb was hidden in a toilet tissue dispenser and went off after Hayes washed his hands and was about to leave. The blast ripped through a wall into a public bar where about thirty people were sitting. The airport was evacuated and a second bomb was found and safely detonated by a bomb disposal team.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe UDA claimed responsibility for the bombing shortly after. It said it was \"retaliation for the murders of members of the British security forces  by the IRA operating unhindered from the haven of the Republic with the blessing of the Dublin government\". \n\nPolitical leaders and the main political parties condemned the bombing. Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Gerry Fitt said it was \"crazy that the UDA was still a fully legalised organisation\" in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe UDA bombed Dublin again 11 years later in November 1986, planting four small bombs in bins. Two of the bombs were defused but the other two detonated, although they only caused minor damage and a small fire and nobody was killed or injured. The UDA said they planted the bombs in protest at the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985.\n\n==See also==\n* RTE Studio bombing\n* Belturbet bombing \n* 1972 and 1973 Dublin bombings\n* Dublin and Monaghan bombings\n* 1975 Dundalk pub bombing \n* Castleblayney bombing\n* 1994 Dublin-Belfast train bombing\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/www.independent.ie\/regionals\/fingalindependent\/news\/airport-worker-was-killed-by-1975-bombing-27768908.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1986\/11\/09\/world\/around-the-world-irish-protestant-group-says-it-planted-bombs.html"]}
{"title":"Donnelly's Bar and Kay's Tavern attacks","article":"During the evening of 19 December 1975, two coordinated attacks were carried out by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) in pubs either side of the Irish border. The first attack, a car bombing, took place outside Kay's Tavern, a pub along Crowe Street in Dundalk, County Louth, Republic of Ireland - close to the border. The second, a gun and bomb attack, took place at Donnelly's Bar & Filling Station in Silverbridge, County Armagh, just across the border inside Northern Ireland. The attack has been linked to the Glenanne gang, a group of loyalist militants who were either members of the UVF, the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the closely linked UVF paramilitary the Red Hand Commando (RHC), some of the Glenanne gang were members of two of these organizations at the same time like gang leaders Billy Hanna who was in both the UVF and the UDR and who fought for the British Army during the Korean War and John Weir who was in the UVF and was a sergeant in the RUC. At least 25 UDR men and police officers were named as members of the gang. The Red Hand Commando claimed to have carried out both attacks.\n\n==Attacks==\nAccording to journalist Joe Tiernan, the attacks were planned and led by Robert McConnell and Robin \"The Jackal\" Jackson who were both alleged to have carried out dozens of sectarian murders during The Troubles, mainly from 1974 to 1977, mostly in south Armagh - which in 1975 was virtually lawless; loyalist paramilitaries and the Provisional IRA roamed the streets and countryside and could set up bogus military checkpoints freely.\n\nThe attack was planned at the Glenanne farm of RUC reserve officer James Mitchell which was where most terrorist acts were planned by the gang and the farm also acted as a UVF arms dump and bomb-making site. After the attacks were finished everyone involved in both attacks was to meet at Mitchell's farm. Then if there was any heat Mitchell could claim the bombers and shooters were with him when the attacks happened.\n\nThe first phase of the plan started at around 18:15 along Crowe Street in Dundalk when a 100-pound no-warning bomb exploded in a Ford Sports car just outside Kay's Tavern. The blast killed Hugh Waters who was a tailor and had just dropped into the pub to deliver some clothes he had altered for the pub's owner almost instantly. Jack Rooney who was walking past the town hall on the opposite side of the street was struck in the head by flying shrapnel and died three days later. A further 20 people were injured in the explosion, several of them very seriously. The car bomb was fitted with fake southern registration plates and placed in one of the busiest streets in Dundalk in the hope of causing maximum death and injury. According to Joe Tiernan, UVF commander Robin Jackson planted the bomb and along with other members of his unit escaped across the border in a blue Hillman Hunter around the time the bomb went off.\n\nAt around 21:00(9:00PM), about three hours after the Dundalk bombing, the second phase of the coordinated plan which was led by McConnell took place at Donnelly's Bar & Filling Station in the small Armagh village Silverbridge, close to Crossmaglen. As the unit arrived in two cars came unusually fast towards the pub, the publican's son Michael Donnelly (14) who was serving petrol to a customer noticing the strange speed of the cars ran towards the pub to warn people, but before he could make it inside, McConnell jumped out of one of the cars and shot the teenage boy dead with a Sten gun. McConnell then shot the man Michael Donnelly had been serving petrol to in the head, although the man survived the shooting he was maimed for life. Then a second gunman, believed to be Billy McCaughey, a UVF volunteer and member of the RUC Special Patrol Group, shot dead a second person, local man Patrick Donnelly (no relation to the pub owner's family) who had been waiting for petrol. McConnell then went inside the pub and sprayed the bar with his Sten SMG, killing a third man, Trevor Bracknell, and seriously injuring three more people. As McConnell withdrew to his car, two other members of the unit carried a 25-pound cylinder bomb inside the pub. As McConnell's unit fled back to Mitchell's farm, the bomb detonated inside the pub, however by this time most of the people had already left. The explosion at Kay's Tavern destroyed about 80% of the building, started a huge fire and injured two more people; with one of the injured men losing a foot and a hand in the explosion. Nobody has ever been charged for these crimes.\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/cgi-bin\/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&day=19&month=12&year=1975","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/issues\/collusion\/docs\/cassel061106.pdf","https:\/\/talkofdatown.wordpress.com\/tag\/crowes-nest\/<\/ref>"]}
{"title":"1977 Moscow bombings","article":"The 1977 Moscow bombings were a series of three terrorist bombings in Moscow on 8 January 1977. The attacks killed seven people and seriously injured 37 others. No one claimed responsibility for the bombings, although three members of an Armenian nationalist organization were executed early in 1979 after a KGB investigation and a secret trial. Some Soviet dissidents said that the suspects had an alibi. Soon after the event Andrei Sakharov issued a public appeal, expressing concern that the bombings might \"be a new provocation on the part of the organs of repression\". According to historian Jay Bergman, \"who actually caused the explosion has never been determined conclusively\".\n\n==Bombings==\nOn 8 January 1977, three bombs were detonated in Moscow. \n\nThe first exploded at 17:33 on a crowded train between the Izmailovskaya and Pervomaiskaya stations of the Moscow Metro. At 18:05, the second bomb detonated inside a grocery store close to KGB headquarters. Five minutes later, the third bomb exploded near another grocery store on 25 October Street, just a few hundred meters away from the headquarters of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\n\nAt that moment, and for the next two months, there was little public information about the explosions. The TASS news agency reported on 10 January 1977 that the explosion was not of great force, \"medical help was given to those suffering injury, and an investigation is being conducted\". Later, at meetings of Party activists, it was said that not long before the explosion in the underground on 8 January there had been two other explosions on 25 October Street.\n\nOnly on 8 February 1979, after the trial and execution of the three convicted men, did a letter to Izvestia, the official newspaper of the Soviet government, indicate that the attacks had killed seven people and injured 37.\n\n==Investigation and trial==\nSince this was a case of terrorism the official investigation was conducted by the KGB, rather than the Procurator General's Office. \n\nAn initial suspect, named Potapov, was arrested in Tambov after setting off a bomb which killed his neighbour's wife and two daughters. After being arrested, Potapov confessed that he was also behind the acts of terrorism in Moscow. However, this turned out to have been a forced confession, and after an investigation lasting one month, this lead was dropped by KGB operatives.\n\nIn October 1977, at Tashkent Airport, a KGB officer noticed a woman carrying a bag similar to a reconstructed picture of a bomb sent by the KGB to all local branches. It turned out that these bags were manufactured only in Yerevan. In November 1977, Stepan Zatikyan, a founding member of a splinter group of the National United Party, an underground Armenian nationalist organization, was arrested. His accomplices, Zaven Bagdasaryan and Hakop Stepanyan, were also taken into custody after an unsuccessful attempt to detonate a bomb at the Kursky Rail Terminal in Moscow. \n\nA secret trial followed. Zatikyan, Stepanyan, and Bagdasaryan were all found guilty on 24 January 1978 and executed five days later. The Supreme Court issued a brief statement, dated 31 January 1979, after the trial and execution, naming Zatikyan alone as the perpetrator. According to KGB general Philip Bobkov, any publications in Armenia about the bombings were blocked by Karen Demirchyan, the head of Soviet Armenia.\n\n==Alleged KGB involvement==\nThe 8 January 1977 bombings occurred during systematic reprisals by the Soviet authorities against the Helsinki Groups in Moscow, Ukraine and Lithuania, set up to monitor the USSR's observance of the Helsinki Accords.\n\nOn 10 January 1977, Soviet journalist Victor Louis (Vitaly Yevgenyevich Lui), a well known KGB agent provocateur, published an article in a British newspaper, hinting at the involvement of Soviet dissidents in the bombings. Several dissidents, including Albrekht, the secretary of the Soviet branch of Amnesty International, were threatened and interrogated by the KGB. (Soviet dissident Alexander Tarasov claimed to have been interrogated by a KGB investigator who tried to \"convince\" him that he was involved in the bombing. Without his strong alibi - he was confined at a hospital at the time of the bombings - \"it would be me who was executed instead of Zatikyan\", he said.) In response Andrei Sakharov wrote an \"Appeal to world community\", in which he requested an impartial investigation and suggested that the bombings might have been arranged by the KGB itself to discredit the entire Soviet dissident movement.\n\n\u2026 I cannot rid myself of the hunch that the explosion in the Moscow underground and the tragic deaths of individuals are a new provocation on the part of the organs of repression, and the most dangerous of recent years. Precisely this hunch, and the fears connected with it that this provocation could lead to changes in the whole internal climate of the country, have prompted me to write this article. I would be very glad if my thoughts turned out to be wrong \u2026\n\n\nIn an exchange with the deputy Procurator General, he added, \"I have serious grounds for concern. This is the provocation article in London Evening News by Victor Lui. These are arrests and interrogations of people who are clearly not related to the bombings. These are murders of last months, probably committed by the KGB which were not investigated. It is enough to mention only two of them: murder of poet Konstantin Bogatyrev and murder of lawyer Evgeni Brunov.\" After this statement, Sakharov was not only attacked in Soviet newspapers but also received threats by phone. Several people tried to break into his apartment, claiming to be relatives of those killed in the Metro.\n\nAccording to former KGB colonel Oleg Gordievsky, the three Armenians were selected as scapegoats for this terrorist act. He wrote, \"The case that most alarmed the KGB was the bombing of the Moscow subway by Armenian separatists in 1977. Three Armenians were later shot. It was rumored in the Center that, when the KGB and militia failed to track down those responsible, three other Armenian separatists had been selected as scapegoats in order to demonstrate that terrorists would always be caught and punished.\"\n\nIn 1982, historians Michel Heller and Alexander Nekrich assert Zatikyan, Stepanyan, and Bagdasaryan had an alibi supported by multiple witnesses, and their execution was the first political execution in the Soviet Union after the death of Stalin.\n\nThe Armenian dissident Sergei Grigoryants said in 2016 that KGB chief Yuri Andropov and Philipp Bobkov were responsible for the bombings.\n\n==Sakharov's letter to Brezhnev==\nOn 30 January 1979, A. D. Sakharov wrote a letter to L. I. Brezhnev, about the trial of the three Armenian suspects:\n\nThere are strong grounds for fearing that a deliberate frame-up or a judicial mistake is taking place in this case. Zatikyan was not in Moscow at the time of the underground explosion \u2014 many witnesses can confirm his alibi. The investigation did not show any interest in clarifying this or other important circumstances. The trial, totally unnecessarily, was closed and secret, and even relatives did not know that it was taking place. Such a trial, in which the principle of openness is totally disregarded, cannot determine the truth.\n\nI appeal to you to stop the death sentence being carried out on all the accused in this case, and to demand a new inquiry from the investigative and court organs.\n\nOn 1 February 1979, the Moscow Helsinki Group made an official statement on the execution of Stepan Zatikyan and two other unnamed individuals, stating, \"The lack of transparency and the whole atmosphere of secrecy give reasons to doubt the validity of charges, objectivity and impartiality of the court\".\n\nOne consequence was the 8 February 1979 letter to Izvestia, denouncing Sakharov and other rights activists as \"Defenders of Murderers\".\n\n==See also==\n* Russian apartment bombings\n* February 2004 Moscow Metro bombing\n* August 2004 Moscow Metro bombing\n* 2010 Moscow Metro bombings\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/chronicle-of-current-events.com\/2019\/06\/26\/concerning-the-explosions-in-moscow-march-1977-44-15\/","http:\/\/old.samara.ru\/paper\/41\/5070\/91049\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20091224124752\/http:\/\/old.samara.ru\/paper\/41\/5070\/91049\/","https:\/\/chronicle-of-current-events.com\/2019\/06\/26\/concerning-the-explosions-in-moscow-march-1977-44-15\/","https:\/\/chronicle-of-current-events.com\/2019\/06\/27\/the-case-of-the-explosion-on-the-underground-march-1979-52-1\/","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/world\/europe\/3465385.stm","https:\/\/chronicle-of-current-events.com\/2019\/06\/27\/the-case-of-the-explosion-on-the-underground-march-1979-52-1\/","http:\/\/old.samara.ru\/paper\/41\/5142\/91314\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20090404165546\/http:\/\/old.samara.ru\/paper\/41\/5142\/91314\/","https:\/\/chronicle-of-current-events.com\/no-44-16-march-1977-2\/","http:\/\/www.panorama.ru\/gazeta\/1-30\/p30tar.html","https:\/\/chronicle-of-current-events.com\/2019\/06\/26\/concerning-the-explosions-in-moscow-march-1977-44-15\/","http:\/\/www.memo.ru\/ABOUT\/bull\/b14\/13.htm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20090730224436\/http:\/\/www.memo.ru\/about\/bull\/b14\/13.htm","http:\/\/www.ras.ru\/FStorage\/FileInfo.aspx?catalogId=2ab39994-3e88-4481-bc17-bb73f14b9633&id=5a82913b-75e2-45da-b27b-fa932920a2e1&_Language=ru","http:\/\/www.krotov.info\/history\/11\/geller\/gell_1965.html","http:\/\/grigoryants.ru\/sovremennaya-diskussiya\/vzryv-v-moskovskom-metro-1977\/","https:\/\/chronicle-of-current-events.com\/2019\/06\/27\/the-case-of-the-explosion-on-the-underground-march-1979-52-1\/","http:\/\/www.mhg.ru\/history\/15D6785","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180330155829\/https:\/\/www.mhg.ru\/index.php","https:\/\/chronicle-of-current-events.com\/2019\/06\/27\/the-case-of-the-explosion-on-the-underground-march-1979-52-1\/"]}
{"title":"Bologna massacre","article":"The Bologna massacre was a terrorist bombing of the Bologna Centrale railway station in Bologna, Italy, on the morning of 2 August 1980, which killed 85 people and wounded over 200. Several members of the neo-fascist terrorist organization  (NAR, Armed Revolutionary Nuclei) were sentenced for the bombing, although the group denied involvement.\n\n== Events ==\n\n\nAt 10:25 CEST, a time bomb hidden in an unattended suitcase detonated in an air-conditioned waiting room at the Bologna station, which was full of people seeking refuge from the August heat. The explosion collapsed the roof of the waiting room, destroyed most of the main building, and hit the Ancona\u2013Chiasso train which was waiting at the first platform.\n\nThe station was full of tourists that Saturday, and the city was unprepared for a major disaster. Many passers-by and travelers provided first aid to victims and helped rescue people who were buried under the rubble.\n\nDue to the large number of casualties and an insufficient number of emergency vehicles available to transport the injured to hospitals, firefighters used buses, private cars, and taxis. Some doctors and hospital staff returned early from vacation to care for the victims, and hospital departments which were closed for the summer holidays were reopened to accommodate the casualties.\n\nAfter the attack, large demonstrations were held in Piazza Maggiore (Bologna's central square). Harsh criticism was directed at government representatives who attended the 6 August funerals of the victims in the Basilica San Petronio. The only applause was reserved for President Sandro Pertini, who arrived by helicopter in Bologna at 5:30 pm the day of the massacre and tearfully said: \"I have no words; we are facing the most criminal enterprise that has ever taken place in Italy.\"\n\nThe #37 bus (used to transport victims) and the clock (stopped at 10:25) were symbols of the massacre. The attack was the worst atrocity in Italy since World War II.\n\n== Investigation ==\nThe Italian government, led by Christian Democratic Prime Minister Francesco Cossiga, first assumed that the incident was due to an accidental explosion of an old boiler in the station's basement. Evidence, however, soon pointed to terrorism. L'Unit\u00e0, the Italian Communist Party (PCI) newspaper, attributed responsibility for the attack to neo-fascists on 3 August. Later, in a special session of the Senate, Cossiga also supported the theory that neo-fascists were behind the attack: \"Unlike leftist terrorism, which strikes at the heart of the state through its representatives, right-wing terrorism prefers acts such as massacres because acts of extreme violence promote panic and impulsive reactions.\" The bomb was later found to be composed of  of explosives:  of TNT and Composition B and  of T4 (nitroglycerin for civil use).\n\n== False leads ==\nShortly after the bombing, the Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata press agency received a call from an individual claiming to represent NAR and claiming responsibility. The call later proved fake, originating instead from the Florence office of SISMI (the Italian Military Secret Service). Federigo Manucci Benincasa, the director of SISMI's Florence branch, was later charged with obstruction of justice.\n\nA Lebanese connection was manufactured in September 1980 involving Al Fatah, Phalangists, Italian radicals and Swiss journalists tied to the Italian intelligence community, who supplied investigators with fake notes, memos, and reports. This was followed by a KGB connection concocted by intelligence head General Giuseppe Santovito, a member of P2, and Francesco Pazienza.\n\nGenerals Pietro Musumeci, another member of P2, and Belmonte of SISMI had a police sergeant put a suitcase full of similar explosives on a train in Bologna. The suitcase also contained personal items belonging to two right-wing extremists, a Frenchman, and a German. Musumeci also produced a phony dossier, entitled \"Terror on trains\". He was charged with falsifying evidence to incriminate Roberto Fiore and Gabriele Adinolfi, two leaders of the far-right Terza Posizione who had fled to London. Both Terza Posizione leaders said that Musumeci was trying to divert attention from P2 head Licio Gelli. Musumeci and Belmonte were convicted of obstructing the investigation.\n\n== Prosecution ==\nThe attack has been attributed to the NAR (Armed Revolutionary Nuclei), a neo-fascist terrorist organization. A long, controversial court case began after the bombing. Francesca Mambro and Valerio Fioravanti were sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Luigi Ciavardini, a NAR member with close ties to Terza Posizione, in April 2007. Ciavardini received a 30-year prison sentence for his role in the attack. He had been arrested after the armed robbery of the Banca Unicredito di Roma on 15 September 2005. Ciavardini was also charged with the assassinations of Francesco Evangelista on 28 May 1980 and Judge Mario Amato on 23 June 1980.\n\nOn 26 August 1980, the prosecutor of Bologna issued twenty-eight arrest warrants for far-right militants of the NAR and Terza Posizione. Among those arrested were Massimo Morsello (future founder of the neo-fascist organization and political party Forza Nuova), Francesca Mambro, Aldo Semerari, Maurizio Neri, and Paolo Signorelli. They were interrogated in Ferrara, Rome, Padua, and Parma. All were released from prison in 1981.\n\nThe first trial began in Bologna on 9 March 1987. Massimiliano Fachini, Valerio Fioravanti, Francesca Mambro, Sergio Picciafuoco, Roberto Rinani and Paolo Signorelli were charged with murder. Gilberto Cavallini, Fachini, Fioravanti, Egidio Giuliani, Marcello Iannilli, Mambro, Giovanni Melioli, Picciafuoco, Roberto Raho, Rinani and Signorelli were charged with forming an armed gang. Marco Ballan, Giuseppe Belmonte, Fabio De Felice, Stefano Delle Chiaie, Fachini, Licio Gelli, Maurizio Giorgi, Pietro Musumeci, Francesco Pazienza, Signorelli and Adriano Tilgher were charged with subversive association. Belmonte, Gelli, Musumeci and Pazienza were charged with defamation.\n\nOn 11 July 1988, Fachini, Fioravanti, Mambro and Picciafuoco were sentenced to life imprisonment for murder; Rinani and Signorelli were acquitted. Cavallini, Fachini, Fioravanti, Giuliani, Mambro, Picciafuoco, Rinani and Signorelli were convicted of forming an armed gang; Iannilli, Melioli and Raho were acquitted. Ballan, Belmonte, Felice, Delle Chiaie, Fachini, Gelli, Giorgi, Musumeci, Pazienza, Signorelli and Tilgher were acquitted of subversive association. Belmonte, Gelli, Musumeci and Pazienza were convicted of defamation. The appeal process began on 25 October 1989.\n\nOn appeal, Fachini, Fioravanti, Mambro, Picciafuoco, Rinani and Signorelli were acquitted of murder on 18 July 1990. Cavallini, Fioravanti, Mambro and Giuliani were convicted of forming an armed gang. Belmonte and Musumeci were convicted of defamation, and the other defendants were acquitted.\n\nOn 12 February 1992, the Supreme Court of Cassation acquitted Rinani and Signorelli of murder; Signorelli was also acquitted of forming an armed gang and subversive association. The court also acquitted other defendants, canceled the judgment and ordered a new trial because the sentences were \"illogical, incoherent, not assessing proofs and evidence in good terms, not taking into account the facts preceding and following the event, unmotivated or poorly motivated, in some parts the judges supporting unlikely arguments that not even the defense had argued\".\n\nThe new trial began on 11 October 1993. Massimiliano Fachini, Valerio Fioravanti, Francesca Mambro and Sergio Picciafuoco were charged with murder; Gilberto Cavallini, Massimiliano Fachini, Egidio Giuliani, Valerio Fioravanti, Francesca Mambro, Sergio Picciafuoco and Roberto Rinani were charged with forming an armed gang, and Giuseppe Belmonte, Licio Gelli, Pietro Musumeci, and Francesco Pazienza were charged with defamation. On 16 May 1994, Fioravanti, Mambro and Picciafuoco were sentenced to life imprisonment; Fachini was acquitted.\nCavallini, Fioravanti, Giuliani, Mambro and Picciafuoco were convicted of forming an armed gang; Fachini and Rinani were acquitted.\nBelmonte, Gelli, Musumeci and Pazienza were convicted of defamation.\n\nOn 23 November 1995: The Supreme Court upheld Fioravanti, Mambro, Gelli, Pazienza, Musumeci and Belmonte's convictions, ordering a new trial for Picciafuoco (who was acquitted by the Appeals Court in Florence on 18 June 1996, a verdict upheld by the Supreme Court on 15 April 1997). In April 1998, Mambro was given home confinement and allowed to leave prison during the day.\n\nIn June 2000, Massimo Carminati (NAR member), Ivano Bongiovanni (far-right sympathizer) and Federigo Manucci Benincasa (SISMI officer) were convicted of obstruction. Carminati and Manucci Benincasa were acquitted for lack of evidence in December 2001, and Bongiovanni's conviction was upheld. On 30 January 2003, the Court of Cassation finally acquitted Carminati and Manucci Benincasa.\n\n== Hypotheses ==\n\nAs a result of protracted legal procedures and false leads, a number of theories were proposed during the years after the attack. Involvement by Italian Secret Service officials was suggested.\n\nBetween 1999 and 2006, during sessions of the parliamentary commission established to probe terrorism in Italy and the failure to identify those responsible for the massacre and a commission investigating the Mitrokhin dossier and Italian intelligence activity, new information emerged on international terrorist networks and Italian intelligence in the former Soviet bloc and Arab countries such as Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Yemen and Iraq. Secret agreements with the Palestinian leadership tied to arms trafficking between the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and Italy and a warning to the Italian anti-terrorist secret service three weeks before the massacre were discovered. Thomas Kram, member of a German terrorist group linked to Carlos the Jackal and the Palestinians, was in Bologna on the day of the massacre. On 17 November 2005, the Bologna prosecutor opened a case (Dossier 7823\/2005 RG) against unknown persons. According to media reports in 2004 and 2007, Francesco Cossiga suggested Palestinian involvement in a letter to Enzo Fragal\u00e0 of the Mitrokhin Commission.\n\nIn 2005, Carlos the Jackal said that \"the Mitrokhin Commission attempts to falsify history\" and \"they were the CIA and the Mossad to hit in Bologna\" with the intent to punish Italy for its relationship with the PLO. After the 2006 arrest of former Argentine Triple A member Rodolfo Almir\u00f3n, Spanish lawyer Jos\u00e9 Angel P\u00e9rez Nievas declared that it was \"probable that Almir\u00f3n participated\u2014along with Stefano Delle Chiaie and Augusto Cauchi\u2014in the 1980 bombing in Bologna's train station\". In 1998, the Supreme Court of Argentina refused to extradite Cauchi to Italy.\nIn May 2007, Massimo Sparti's son said: \"My father has always lied about the Bologna investigation\".\n\nDuring a 2008 BBC interview, former Italian president Francesco Cossiga reaffirmed his belief that the massacre was attributable to Palestinian resistance groups operating in Italy (rather than fascist black terrorism) and in the innocence of Francesca Mambro and Valerio Fioravanti. The PFLP has always denied responsibility. On 19 August 2011, the Bologna prosecutor began an investigation of two German terrorists: Thomas Kram and Christa Margot Fr\u00f6hlich, both linked to Carlos the Jackal's group and in Bologna on the day of the attack.\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nRelatives of the victims formed the Associazione dei familiari delle vittime della strage alla stazione di Bologna del 2 agosto 1980 on 1 June 1981 to raise and maintain awareness of the bombing. The group, which began with 44 members, grew to 300. On 6 April 1983, the association and victims' associations of victims of the Piazza Fontana, Piazza della Loggia and Italicus Express bombings formed the Union of Relatives of Victims to Massacres (Unione dei Familiari delle Vittime per Stragi) in Milan.\n\n\n\nBologna and the Associazione tra i familiari delle vittime della strage alla stazione di Bologna del 2 agosto 1980 sponsor an annual international composition competition which ends with a concert in Piazza Maggiore on 2 August, a national memorial day for all terrorist massacres. Although the damaged part of the station has been mostly reconstructed, the original floor tile pierced by the detonation has been left in place and a deep crack (covered by a glass panel) has been left in the reconstructed main wall. The station clock was stopped at 10:25, the time of the explosion, in 1996.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe bombing is the backdrop of a chapter of Laurent Binet's . The 2017 French novel, which satirizes late-20th-century Parisian intellectual and political life, involves two detectives investigating what they assume to be the murder of the philosopher Roland Barthes. The detectives, who travel to Bologna to interview Umberto Eco, narrowly escape injury in the attack.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* Banda della Magliana, a mafia gang with links to the fascist-aligned NAR\n* False flag operations\n* List of terrorist incidents\n* Itavia Flight 870\n* La notte della Repubblica (TV programme)\n* List of massacres in Italy\n* Piazza Fontana bombing\n* Strategy of tension\n* Games of the XXII Olympiad (Moscow)\n* Propaganda Due (P2 lodge)\n* Carlos the Jackal\n* Terrorism in Europe\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n*La strage.

{"title":"Oktoberfest bombing","article":"-->\n}}\nThe Oktoberfest bombing was a terrorist attack with a right-wing radical motive. On 26 September 1980, 12 people were killed and 211 were injured by the explosion of an improvised explosive device (IED) at the main entrance of the Oktoberfest in Munich, West Germany. The attack is the second-deadliest in Germany since World War II. The attack was attributed to the right-wing extremist and geology student Gundolf K\u00f6hler who was killed while placing the bomb; however, doubts remain as to whether he acted alone.\n\n==Attack and immediate impact==\nOktoberfest is an outdoor beer festival held during a 16-day period running from late September to the first weekend in October, celebrating beer in Munich, Germany.\n\nAt 10:19\u00a0p.m. on 26 September 1980, a bomb exploded at the main entrance to Oktoberfest, killing 13 people instantly (including the perpetrator) and injuring 225 people. Amongst the individuals killed were one Briton, one Swiss, and three German children, aged 6, 8, and 10; the remaining victims were West German adults.\n\nThe bomb had been planted in a litter bin at about waist level, allowing it to wreak significant havoc upon detonation. Approximately 50 of the 225 survivors experienced serious, life-threatening injuries with the potential to impact the afflicted individuals for the rest of their lives. The area affected by the bombing was the size of a football field, approximately 100 metres by 60 metres. Reconstruction from the site of the bombing indicates that it was created from a British mortar projectile manufactured in 1954. This particular projectile was modified to ensure an intense degree of fragmentation, assisting in causing as many fatalities and severe injuries as quickly as possible. This explains the large scale of casualties and injuries caused by the blast.\n\n== Criticism of the official investigation ==\n\nThe \"single attacker\" theory that was the conclusion of the official investigation has been doubted by many, including local politicians, victims and various journalists and attorneys.\n\nThe criticisms of the official investigation include the fact that known connections between K\u00f6hler and the Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann, a known neo-Nazi militia, were all but ignored in the final report. Also, several eyewitness accounts of the attack itself mentioned K\u00f6hler speaking to two individuals wearing olive parkas immediately prior to the explosion as well as statements that a second individual was seen with K\u00f6hler looking into the plastic bag that the IED was believed to be in.\n\nThe last remaining pieces of evidence from the attack such as shrapnel from the IED were disposed of in 1997. This is routine in investigations that are considered cleared, yet it created some blow-back due to the political background of the attack and the lingering questions surrounding the official investigation.\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn 2009, German novelist Wolfgang Schorlau published a book about the event, entitled Das M\u00fcnchen-Komplott (\"The Munich plot\").\n\nIn 2013, the feature film Der blinde Fleck (\"The blind spot\") was released to German cinemas, starring Benno F\u00fcrmann in the lead and concerning a dramatized event of journalist Ulrich Chaussy's investigations throughout the 1980s regarding the Oktoberfest bombing and possible political cover-ups of a radical right-wing network behind it.\n\nThe 1988 album What Good Is Grief to a God? by D.I. includes the event in a list of terrorist actions in the song \"Terrorist's Life\".\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n*  Oktoberfest-Attentat, 26 September 1980 ,  (Bavarian historical lexicon).","urls":["https:\/\/www.dw.com\/en\/germany-1980-oktoberfest-bombing-a-far-right-attack\/a-54085190","https:\/\/www.sueddeutsche.de\/muenchen\/oktoberfest-attentat-muenchen-ermittlungen-beendet-1.4959372","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=1w8xDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT200","https:\/\/www.zeit.de\/gesellschaft\/zeitgeschehen\/2019-05\/muenchen-oktoberfestattentat-ermittlungen-soko-einstellung","https:\/\/www.sueddeutsche.de\/muenchen\/oktoberfest-attentat-die-asservatenkammer-ist-leer-1.465382","https:\/\/www.dw.com\/en\/german-prosecutors-re-open-probe-into-deadly-1980-okoberfest-attack\/a-18123766","https:\/\/www.spiegel.de\/international\/germany\/1980-oktoberfest-bombing-did-neo-nazi-murderer-really-act-alone-a-717229.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/12\/12\/world\/europe\/germany-reopens-inquiry-into-1980-oktoberfest-bombing-with-new-witness.html","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=MT4nDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT178"]}
{"title":"1981 Azbakiyah bombing","article":"The 1981 Azbakiyah bombing was a terrorist car bomb attack that rocked the densely populated al-Azbakiyah neighborhood of central Damascus in Syria on 29 November 1981. The explosion, which took place in front of a school in Baghdad Street, close to a complex of intelligence agencies, destroyed three five-story apartment buildings, and killed 64 civilians and military men. The attack was blamed on the Muslim Brotherhood which was waging an insurrection against the government of Hafez al-Assad at the time.\n\nHowever, a group calling itself the Organisation for the Liberation of Lebanon from Foreigners claimed responsibility for the bombing. It is believed to be the same group as the Front for the Liberation of Lebanon from Foreigners, which was responsible for a series of bombings in Lebanon, which killed 146 people.\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/asadofsyriastrug00seal\/page\/331","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/asadofsyriastrug00seal\/page\/331","https:\/\/mobile.nytimes.com\/1981\/11\/30\/world\/bomb-explosion-in-syria-kills-64-and-hurts-135-in-crowded-area.html"]}
{"title":"Iraqi embassy bombing in Beirut","article":"On December 15, 1981, the Iraqi Shi'a Islamist group al-Dawa carried out a suicide car bombing targeting the Iraqi embassy in Beirut, Lebanon. The explosion leveled the embassy and killed 61 people, including Iraq's ambassador to Lebanon, and injured 110 others.\n\nThe attack is considered by many to be the second modern suicide bombing, preceded by the 1927 Bath School bombings and presaged the 1983 United States embassy bombing and the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings.\n\n==Background==\nEmboldened by the success of the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the anti-Baathist Shi'a Islamist group al-Dawa, with financial and military assistance from the Islamic Republic of Iran, began to employ violence in its struggle against the Iraqi government. In 1979 and 1980, al-Dawa assassinated a number of \"senior but low-profile\" Baathist officials in Iraq. In response to a failed assassination attempt on Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz in April 1980 by al-Dawa, the Iraqi government launched a severe crackdown on the group, which included the execution of al-Dawa spiritual leader Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr.\n\nThe remaining al-Dawa leadership fled to Iran and the group became an \"effective proxy\" for the Iranian government against Iraq during the Iran\u2013Iraq War, which broke out in September 1980.\n\n==Bombing==\nOn December 15, 1981, a car filled with approximately 100 kilograms of explosives was driven into Iraq's embassy building in Beirut by a suicide bomber. The ensuing explosion devastated the embassy, killed 61 people, including the Iraq ambassador, Abdul Razzak Lafta, and injured more than 100 others. Balqis al-rawi, the Iraqi wife of Syrian poet Nizar Qabbani, who worked for the embassy's cultural section, was also killed in the attack.\n\n==Impact==\nThe attack, which presaged the 1983 United States embassy bombing and the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing, is considered by some to be the first modern suicide bombing, though others nominate earlier attacks.\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/www.meib.org\/articles\/0306_iraqd.htm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20030715202301\/http:\/\/www.meib.org\/articles\/0306_iraqd.htm","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=E24eVvgg6yUC&pg=PT50&lpg=PT50&dq","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=IMTu5gwWE0kC&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=","http:\/\/www.apnewsarchive.com\/1998\/Syrian-Poet-Nizar-Qabbani-Dies\/id-e1090608286b31493838761292984678","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=Sgcmk-Gx_mIC&pg=PA81&lpg=PA81&dq","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=hYDCAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31&dq","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=iex_V2M2VB0C&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=%22first+modern+suicide+bombing%22&source=bl&ots=z0X8qCG4lq&sig=ytXAO1LERvYdeNPQ8S0NcjWGFhY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dKqtUvuUGIP_iAeAt4Fo&redir_esc=y","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=jZIXOlW7pgwC&pg=PA35&dq=%22first+modern+suicide+bombing%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GKPjUp7wKI-HkgWZ54G4CQ&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA"]}
{"title":"Droppin Well bombing","article":"The Droppin Well bombing or Ballykelly bombing occurred on 6 December 1982, when the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) exploded a time bomb at a disco in Ballykelly, Northern Ireland. The disco, known as the Droppin Well, was targeted because it was frequented by British Army soldiers from nearby Shackleton Barracks. The bomb killed eleven soldiers and six civilians; 30 people were injured, this made it the most deadly attack during the INLA's paramilitary campaign and the most deadly attack during The Troubles carried out in County Londonderry.\n\n==Attack==\nThe bomb was manufactured by the INLA in nearby Derry. One of those involved later revealed that the INLA unit had carried out reconnaissance missions to the Droppin Well to see if there were enough soldiers to justify the likelihood of civilian casualties.\n\nOn the evening of 6 December 1982, an INLA member left a bomb inside the pub. There were about 150 people inside. The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) believed that the bomb, estimated to be  of commercial (Frangex) explosives, was small enough to fit into a handbag. It had, however, been left beside a support pillar and, when it exploded at about 23:15, the blast brought down the roof. Many of those killed and injured were crushed by fallen masonry.\n\nFollowing the blast, it took a few hours to pull survivors from the rubble. The last survivor was freed at 04:00, but it was not until 10:30 that the last of the bodies was recovered. Ultimately, 17 people died (11 soldiers, six civilians) and about 30 were injured, some seriously. Five of the civilians were young women and three (Alan Callaghan, Valerie McIntyre and Angela Maria Hoole) were teenagers. Angela Hoole was celebrating her engagement to one of the soldiers who survived the incident. Of the eleven soldiers who died, eight were from the 1st Battalion Cheshire Regiment, two from the Army Catering Corps and one from the Light Infantry. One of those on the scene was Bob Stewart, then a company commander in the Cheshire Regiment. He lost six soldiers from his company and was deeply affected as he tended to the dead and injured.\n\n==Aftermath==\nSuspicion immediately fell upon the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), who denied involvement.  By 8 December, the British Army was blaming the INLA on grounds that the IRA, in a mixed village, would have made greater efforts not to risk killing civilians.\n\nShortly afterwards, the INLA issued a statement of responsibility:\n\n\nWe believe that it is only attacks of such a nature that bring it home to people in Britain and the British establishment. The shooting of an individual soldier, for the people of Britain, has very little effect in terms of the media or in terms of the British administration.\n\nThe INLA also described the civilians killed as \"consorts\". The attack was criticised by many on both sides of the conflict in Northern Ireland due to the high loss of civilian lives. Soon after the INLA had issued its statement, the government of the Republic of Ireland banned the INLA, making membership punishable by seven years imprisonment.\n\nIn an interview after the bombing, INLA leader Dominic McGlinchey said that the Droppin Well's owner had been warned six times to stop offering entertainment to British soldiers. McGlinchey added that the owner, and those who socialised with the soldiers, \"knew full well that the warnings had been given and that the place was going to be bombed at some stage\". It later emerged that the INLA may also have targeted Ballykelly because it believed that the military base was part of NATO's radar and communications network.\n\nSix days after the bombing, RUC officers shot dead INLA members Seamus Grew and Roddie Carroll near a vehicle checkpoint in Armagh. The officers said they believed that the two men were ferrying McGlinchey into Northern Ireland. Neither was armed, nor was McGlinchey in their car.\n\n==Convictions==\nIn June 1986, four INLA members (sisters Anna Moore and Helena Semple, Eamon Moore (no blood relation) and Patrick Shotter) received life sentences for the attack. Anna Moore would later marry loyalist Bobby Corry, whilst both were in prison. Anna's daughter, Jacqueline Moore, was given ten years for manslaughter as the court believed she had been coerced into involvement. She was pregnant during her arrest and later gave birth in jail. All of those convicted were from Derry.\n\n==See also==\n* Timeline of Irish National Liberation Army actions\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.irishexaminer.com\/breakingnews\/specialreports\/special-report-operation-banner--50-years-since-british-army-campaign-started-in-n-ireland-943649.html","http:\/\/www.nuzhound.com\/articles\/irish_news\/arts2002\/dec4_dropping_well__Editorial.php","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/othelem\/chron\/ch82.htm","http:\/\/www.palacebarracksmemorialgarden.org\/ACC.htm","http:\/\/www.londonderrysentinel.co.uk\/news\/local\/tory_mp_still_marked_by_ballykelly_atrocity_1_2102129","http:\/\/www.nuzhound.com\/articles\/irish_news\/arts2007\/dec6_Dropping_Well_INLA_nearly_called-off.php","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/issues\/violence\/docs\/rolston00.htm","http:\/\/www.irishnews.com\/news\/2013\/09\/25\/news\/bomber-mum-still-feels-guilt-but-blames-dirty-protest-cells-71225\/"]}
{"title":"Ankara Esenbo\u011fa Airport attack","article":"The Ankara Esenbo\u011fa Airport attack was a terrorist attack on Ankara Esenbo\u011fa Airport in Ankara, Turkey, located  northeast of Ankara, the capital city of Turkey. The airport has been in operation since 1955. The attack was perpetrated by Zohrab Sarkissian and Levon Ekmekjian of the \"Khrimian Hayrik Suicide Squad\" and the \"Pierre Gulumian commando\" group from the Armenian militant organization Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (known as ASALA) on 7 August 1982. The attack killed nine people and injured 72 others.\n\n==Attack==\nThe attack was carried out by Zohrab Sarkissian and Levon Ekmekjian (Ekmekdjian, Ekmek\u00e7iyan), who detonated a bomb in the middle of the crowded check-in area at Ankara's Esenbo\u011fa Airport, and then opened fire with submachine guns on passport control officers and passengers, going through passport control for a KLM flight. The witnesses said that one of the perpetrators had kept firing at the fleeing passengers while shouting, \"More than a million of us died, what does it matter if 25 of you die?\"\n\nThe gunmen then fled into the cafeteria, where they took 20 people hostage. Security forces rushed into the cafeteria, killing Sarkissian and wounding Ekmekjian, who was then arrested.\n\n==Victims==\nAs result of the attack and the ensuing two-hour shootout, nine people were killed and 72 were wounded. The dead were three Turkish police officers, three Turkish passengers, a Turkish airport worker, an American woman, and a West German engineer.\n\n\n\n==Responsibility==\n\nASALA claimed responsibility for the attack in a phone call and a communique delivered to the Associated Press office in Beirut, by the Pierre Gulumian commando group\" of the ASALA and said that it was a protest against \"the Turkish fascist occupation of our land.\" The ASALA statement said that the responsibility for \"the innocent victims\" of the Ankara airport attack was \"on the shoulders of the enemies of peaceful peoples: the Turkish Government, NATO and the United States.\" They also warned of further attacks in various Western countries unless 85 Armenians imprisoned in those countries were freed within seven days.\n\n==Attackers==\n===Zohrab Sarkissian===\n\nZohrab Sarkissian (alternatively Sarkisyan, in Armenian \u0536\u0585\u0570\u0580\u0561\u057a \u054d\u0561\u0580\u0563\u056b\u057d\u0565\u0561\u0576) born in 1958 was an Armenian member of ASALA and co-perpetrator of the ASALA attack on the Esenbo\u011fa International Airport. He was killed by Turkish police during the Esenbo\u011fa International Airport attack. There is a memorial burial for Sarkissian in Yerablur, near Yerevan, Armenia in a pantheon for deceased ASALA fighters.\n\n===Levon Ekmekjian===\n\nLevon Ekmekjian (alternatively Ekmekdjian or in the Turkish press Ekmek\u00e7iyan, in Armenian \u053c\u0565\u0582\u0578\u0576 \u0537\u0584\u0574\u0567\u0584\u0573\u0565\u0561\u0576) was Lebanese Armenian member of ASALA. He was born in 1958 in Bourj Hamoud, an Armenian quarter near Beirut, Lebanon. He was co-perpetrator of the ASALA attack on the Esenbo\u011fa International Airport. He was seriously injured by the Turkish security police during the operation and was captured alive. \n\nWhen Levon Ekmekjian was told by Turkish police that the gunmen had killed nine people and wounded 72 others, he furiously shouted, \"It wasn't enough!\" \n\nHowever, during the trial by Ankara martial law command military court he said: \"I came here motivated by a belief. However, after this incident, I understand how ridiculous and wrong that belief was.\"\n\nEkmekjian was found guilty of carrying out armed action with the aim of separating the whole or part of the state territory and placing it under the sovereignty of another state and sentenced to death on 7 September 1982.\n\nWhile in prison, Ekmekjian wrote a letter, in which he expressed his remorse about killing innocent people and admonished other ASALA members to give up violence.\n \nHis appeal of the sentence was declined, and he was hanged on 29 January 1983. He is reportedly the last person who was hanged before the death penalty was abolished in Turkey. \n\nThere were many demonstrations by Armenians to protest the sentencing of Ekmekjian in Turkey. The Armenian poet Silva Kaputikyan wrote a poem titled \"Nightly Requiem\" (in Armenian \u00ab\u0533\u056b\u0577\u0565\u0580\u0561\u0575\u056b\u0576 \u057c\u0565\u0584\u057e\u056b\u0565\u0574\u00bb pronounced Gisherayin Rekviyem) in his memory.

{"title":"Tyre headquarters bombings","article":"The Tyre headquarters bombings were two suicide bombings against the Israel Defense Forces' headquarters building in Tyre, Lebanon, in 1982 and 1983. The blasts killed 103 Israelis and 46\u201359 Lebanese, wounding 95 people and were some of the worst losses ever for the IDF. Israel believes both to be the responsibility of Hezbollah.\n\n==First bombing==\nAfter invading Lebanon in June, the Israeli military set up command posts to run the cities they occupied. On November 11, 1982, a Peugeot car packed with explosives struck the seven-story building being used by the Israeli military to govern Tyre. The explosion leveled the building and killed 75 Israeli soldiers, border policemen, and Shin Bet agents. In addition, anywhere from 14\u201327 Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners that were being held by Israel were killed. Twenty-seven Israelis and 28 Arabs were injured.\n\nThe Israeli government said soon after the blast, and insists to this day, that the explosion was an accident resulting from gas cylinders exploding. This is contrary to the three witnesses who saw the Peugeot speed to the building, the identification of the car's parts in the rubble of the building, and the existence of a Shin Bet report detailing the Hezbollah preparations for the bombing.\n\nThere is a monument near Baalbek, Lebanon, dedicated to 17-year-old Ahmad Qassir, the suicide bomber responsible for the attack.\n\n==Second bombing==\nAlmost a year later, a nearly identical bombing happened in Tyre. On November 4, 1983, a suicide bomber drove a pickup truck filled with explosives into a Shin Bet building at an army base in Tyre. The explosion killed 28 Israelis and 32 Lebanese prisoners, and wounded about 40 others.\n\n==See also==\n*1983 Beirut barracks bombing\n*1983 United States embassy bombing\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n*  When in Rome, don't forget the bombs of 1983 - Article on Ahmed Qassir\n*  Sacrifice and \"Self-Martyrdom\" in Shi'ite Lebanon\n*  Suicide Superpower: Martyrdom as a Weapon of Mass Destruction","urls":["https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/secretwarwithira00berg","http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.il\/MFA\/Foreign%20Relations\/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947\/1982-1984\/HIGHLIGHTS%20OF%20MAIN%20EVENTS-%201982-1984","http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/magazine\/article\/0,9171,952250,00.html"]}
{"title":"Chez Jo Goldenberg restaurant attack","article":"The Chez Jo Goldenberg restaurant attack was a bombing and shooting attack on a Jewish restaurant in Paris's Marais district, on 9 August 1982 carried out by the Abu Nidal Organization, a group that splintered from Fatah.  Two assailants threw a grenade into the dining room, then rushed in and fired machine guns.  They killed six people, including two Americans, Ann Van Zanten, a curator at the Chicago Historical Society, and Grace Cutler, and injured 22 others.  Mrs. Van Zanten's husband, David, an art history professor at Northwestern University, was among the injured. BusinessWeek later said it was \"the heaviest toll suffered by Jews in France since World War II.\" The restaurant closed in 2006 and former owner Jo Goldenberg died in 2014.\n\nAlthough the Abu Nidal Organization had long been suspected, suspects from the group were only definitively identified, 32 years after the attacks, in evidence given by two former Abu Nidal members granted anonymity by French judges.\n\nIn March 2015, French authorities said that an international arrest warrant had been issued in connection with the case for three men who belonged to the organization. The suspects were identified as living in  Norway, Jordan and Ramallah in the Palestinian territories. Walid Abdulrahman Abou Zayed, 56, who has become a Norwegian citizen and is unlikely to be extradited or face charges in Norway, and Mahmoud Khader Abed, 59, living in Ramallah are still being sought.\n\nIn June 2015, a Palestinian named Zuhair Mohammed Hassan Khalid al-Abbasi, also known as \"Amiad Atta,\" was arrested in Jordan, according to the Paris prosecutor's office, which also said that France has requested extradition.  On June 17, Jordan released al-Abbasi on bail.\n\n==See also==\n* Irish of Vincennes\n* List of attacks attributed to Abu Nidal\n* List of terrorist incidents in France\n* 1982 Berlin restaurant bombing\n* 1982 Paris car bombing\n*Grand V\u00e9four restaurant bombing\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1982\/08\/11\/world\/plo-foes-linked-to-attack-in-paris.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160307071547\/http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1982\/08\/11\/world\/plo-foes-linked-to-attack-in-paris.html","http:\/\/www.businessweek.com\/news\/2012-03-19\/three-dead-in-shooting-in-front-of-french-jewish-school-afp","https:\/\/www.webcitation.org\/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessweek.com%2Fnews%2F2012-03-19%2Fthree-dead-in-shooting-in-front-of-french-jewish-school-afp&date=2012-03-19","http:\/\/www.ejpress.org\/article\/news\/france\/5194","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170815175341\/http:\/\/www.ejpress.org\/article\/news\/france\/5194","http:\/\/www.jpost.com\/Jewish-World\/Jewish-Features\/Owner-of-famous-Paris-Jewish-restaurant-dies-351950","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180120035339\/http:\/\/www.jpost.com\/Jewish-World\/Jewish-Features\/Owner-of-famous-Paris-Jewish-restaurant-dies-351950","https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/worldnews\/europe\/france\/11681450\/Suspected-mastermind-of-1982-Paris-Jewish-restaurant-attack-held-in-Jordan.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20151117152626\/http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/worldnews\/europe\/france\/11681450\/Suspected-mastermind-of-1982-Paris-Jewish-restaurant-attack-held-in-Jordan.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/03\/05\/world\/europe\/paris-attack-goldenberg-restaurant.html?_r=0","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150403094527\/http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/03\/05\/world\/europe\/paris-attack-goldenberg-restaurant.html?_r=0","http:\/\/www.ladepeche.fr\/article\/2015\/03\/05\/2060921-rue-rosiers-suspect-norvegien-peu-chances-etre-inquiete.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170902011432\/http:\/\/www.ladepeche.fr\/article\/2015\/03\/05\/2060921-rue-rosiers-suspect-norvegien-peu-chances-etre-inquiete.html","https:\/\/www.dagbladet.no\/nyheter\/terrorsiktet-tatt-i-skien\/72827639","https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/jordan-arrests-suspect-in-1982-attack-on-jewish-restaurant-in-paris-1434566976","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180617115551\/https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/jordan-arrests-suspect-in-1982-attack-on-jewish-restaurant-in-paris-1434566976","http:\/\/en.ammonnews.net\/article.aspx?articleno=29197","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180415064124\/http:\/\/en.ammonnews.net\/article.aspx?articleno=29197","https:\/\/www.vg.no\/nyheter\/innenriks\/i\/oARRGj\/nordmann-tatt-i-forbindelse-med-terrorangrep-i-paris-i-1982","https:\/\/www.aftenposten.no\/norge\/i\/yRvvMr\/terrorsiktet-mann-paagrepet-i-skien-knyttes-til-terrorangrep-i-paris","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2020\/sep\/10\/norway-arrests-suspect-linked-to-1982-attack-on-jewish-restaurant-in-paris"]}

{"title":"Church Street, Pretoria bombing","article":"The Church Street bombing was a car bomb attack on 20 May 1983 in the South African capital Pretoria by Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the paramilitary wing of the African National Congress. The bombing killed 19 people, including the two perpetrators, and wounded 217. The Church Street Bombing was the most deadly attack by the ANC against South Africa's ruling National Party.\n\n==Attack==\nThe terrorist attack consisted of a car bomb set off outside the Nedbank Square Building, which was rented by the South African Air Force, on Church Street West, Pretoria, at 4:30 pm on 20 May 1983. The target was supposedly South African Air Force (SAAF) headquarters, but as the bomb was set to go off at the height of rush hour, those killed and wounded included civilians. The bomb exploded ten minutes earlier than planned, killing two of the perpetrators, Freddie Shangwe and Ezekial Maseko, along with 19 other people. At least 20 ambulances took the dead and wounded to hospitals.\n\n==Truth Commission hearing==\nIn submissions to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in 1997 and 1998, the ANC revealed that the attack was orchestrated by a special operations unit of the ANC's Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), commanded by Aboobaker Ismail. At the time of the attack, they reported to Joe Slovo as chief of staff, and the Church Street attack was authorised by Oliver Tambo.\n\nThe ANC's submission said the bombing was in response to a South African cross-border raid into Lesotho in December 1982, which killed 42 ANC supporters and civilians, and the assassination of Ruth First, an ANC activist and the wife of Joe Slovo, in Maputo, Mozambique. It claimed that 11 of the casualties were SAAF personnel and hence a military target. The legal representative of some of the victims argued that as administrative staff including telephonists and typists they could not accept that they were a legitimate military target. \n\nTen MK operatives, including Aboobaker Ismail, applied for amnesty for this and other bombings. The applications were opposed on various grounds, including that it was a terrorist attack disproportionate to the political motive. The TRC found that the number of civilians versus military personnel killed was unclear. Police statistics indicated that seven members of the SAAF were killed. The commission found that at least 84 of the injured were SAAF members or employees. Amnesty was granted by the TRC in 2000.\n\n==See also==\n*List of massacres in South Africa\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/onthisday\/hi\/dates\/stories\/may\/20\/newsid_4326000\/4326975.stm","http:\/\/www.justice.gov.za\/trc\/media\/1998\/9805\/s980506b.htm","http:\/\/www.justice.gov.za\/trc\/media%5C1997%5C9705\/s970512a.htm","http:\/\/www.justice.gov.za\/trc\/decisions%5C2001\/ac21003.htm"]}

{"title":"Bombing of French consulate in West Berlin","article":"The bombing of the French consulate in West Berlin was a terrorist bomb attack targeting the Maison de France consulate on the Kurfuerstendamm in West Berlin, West Germany on 25 August 1983. It killed one person and injured 23 others. The Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) claimed responsibility in a telephone call and also took credit for a bomb at a French base in Beirut the same day, coming a month after the group's Orly Airport attack. The group commented \"We will continue our struggle until the liberation of innocent Armenians from French jails.\" However the attack was actually orchestrated by Ilich Ram\u00edrez S\u00e1nchez, better known as Carlos the Jackal, who had relations with the ASALA's leadership. Carlos claimed responsibility in a letter written to the German Embassy in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe bomb, containing 20 to 30 kg of explosives, was planted in a storage room on the building's fourth floor by Ahmed Mustafa El-Sibai, a Lebanese man and associate of Carlos. The blast tore the building's roof, destroyed the fourth floor and caused part of it to collapse, causing a total of 2.5 million marks in damage. The explosives were brought into East Berlin by Johannes Weinrich, another close aide to Carlos. Weinrich had brought the explosives in a year prior, they had been confiscated by the Stasi secret police, then returned just prior to the bombing by East German major (later lieutenant colonel\/oberstleutnant) Helmut Voigt who passed the explosives back to Weinrich at the Syrian Embassy, which was Carlos's base in East Germany. Weinrich successfully transported the explosives from East to West Berlin via the Friedrichstra\u00dfe before giving them to El-Sibai who planted it.\n\nThe fatal victim was 26-year-old Michael Haritz, a peace activist who was handing out leaflets at the consulate protesting France's nuclear weapons testing in the South Pacific, and died from asphyxiation.\n\nCarlos previously bombed several targets in France, including the 1982 Capitole train bombing. He said the attacks in France and West Berlin were in revenge for French air strikes against a Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine training camp in Lebanon.\n\n==Aftermath and convictions==\nThe Maison de France is a French cultural centre featuring a French book shop, grocery store, cinema and restaurant. It was rebuilt after the attack and opened by Helmut Kohl and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in 1985.\n\nOn 26 March, 1991, approximately six months after the two germanies officially reunified, Voigt fled to Greece. Voigt had heard in news broadcasts of the planned arrests of stasi employees who had supported terrorist actions in west germany as part of their east-german stasi work.  Voigt lived in the Greek port city of Volos under a false identity, but was found and arrested in 1991, when his wife visited him, carrying a tracking device that had been planted in her luggage by west german investigators, without her knowledge.  Voigt was extradited, tried, and found guilty on 12 April 1994 for his role in the bombing, and was sentenced to four years in prison. \n\nIn 1995, after years of searching, Weinrich was detained in Yemen and flown back to Germany.  In 2000, after a four year trial, Weinrich was found guilty and given a life sentence.  Nabil Shritah, the Syrian diplomat who stored the explosives at the embassy, was given a two year sentence at this time.\n\n==See also==\n*1981 Turkish consulate attack in Paris\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.bz-berlin.de\/liveticker\/rueckblick-anschlag-auf-maison-de-france","https:\/\/www.upi.com\/Archives\/1983\/08\/25\/Armenian-terrorists-bomb-three-French-targets\/1128430632000\/","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1983\/08\/26\/world\/french-consulate-bombed-in-berlin.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1994\/04\/12\/world\/ex-east-german-agent-guilty-in-terror-bombing.html","https:\/\/www.focus.de\/politik\/deutschland\/terrorismus-einer-muss-fuer-alle-buessen_aid_144740.html","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/coldwarradiodang00cumm","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/coldwarradiodang00cumm\/page\/112","https:\/\/books.google.com\/?id=DkNHAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT276&lpg=PT276&dq=Mustafa+Ahmed+al-Sibai+1983+west+berlin;","https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Helmut_Voigt","https:\/\/www.spiegel.de\/politik\/deutschland\/chronologie-der-anschlag-und-die-justiz-a-60047.html","http:\/\/www.spiegel.de\/politik\/deutschland\/wegen-sprengstoffanschlag-lebenslang-fuer-johannes-weinrich-a-60042.html"]}
{"title":"Train 904 bombing","article":"The Train 904 bombing (Italian: Strage del Rapido 904 or Strage di Natale (Christmas massacre)) was a terror attack which occurred on 23 December 1984, in the Apennine Base Tunnel. A bomb on the 904 express train (Rapido 904) from Naples to Milan was detonated, killing 16 and wounding 266. The bombing location was near the location of the Italicus Express bombing ten years previously.\n\nThe motive behind the bomb attack was to distract Italian security forces from investigating the Sicilian Mafia after the testimony of the Mafia turncoat Tommaso Buscetta to Antimafia prosecutor Giovanni Falcone had led to a series of arrest warrants in September 1984 that subsequently would lead to the Maxi Trial against 475 Mafia defendants. Mafia boss Giuseppe Cal\u00f2, also known as \"Pippo\", was convicted for ordering and organising the attack in February 1989. In April 2011 Mafia \"boss of bosses\" Salvatore Riina was indicted for ordering the bombing.\n\n==The bombing==\nOn Sunday, December 23, 1984 the Rapido 904 was on regular service between Naples and Milan. It was traveling northbound, overcrowded by 700 holiday passengers coming back home or visiting relatives due to the upcoming Christmas holidays. At 19:08 a bomb exploded in the ninth car, a 2nd class coach in the middle of the train. The train was 8 kilometers into the Apennine Base Tunnel, on the Florence-Bologna line near Vernio, on a long straight stretch with speed limits of up to 160\u00a0km\/h at the time, and was travelling at 150\u00a0km\/h. \n\nThe bomb had been placed on a luggage rack whilst the train was in Florence Santa Maria Novella railway station. Unlike train bombings in the previous decades of political turmoil, the bomb was remote controlled and was detonated while the train was well into the tunnel, in order to maximize the damage. The bomb exploded as planned. Its shock wave, reflected by the tunnel sides, blew out all the window glass and internal doors, throwing shrapnel-like shards into the compartments. 15 died as a direct consequence of the blast, and one more died later because of the wounds. \n\nThe emergency brake was pulled, and the train came to a stop a thousand or so meters from the blast, 8 kilometers from the northern entrance and 10 from the southern. Train conductor Gian Claudio Bianconcini \u2013 on his last journey before retiring \u2013 was wounded in the nape of his neck, but managed to reach a service telephone and call for help. Passengers were scared and stranded in the cold Apennine winter.\n\n==First response==\nBianconcini gave first aid to the passengers while the gallery's neon lights were fading since the explosion had blasted away the overhead wires. Rescuers encountered problems reaching the disaster scene. Rescue vehicles gathered at the southern entrance of the tunnel, but were blocked by thick smoke emerging from it. After an hour and a half the first service vehicles dispatched to the scene could reach the stricken train, without any hint of what happened. \n\nRadio communications were difficult, worsened by the lack of a mobile radio link; weather was bad, the train was deep inside the tunnel and a strong smell of black powder impaired breathing. While damage and smoke impaired prompt access from the southern entrance, the wind blowing smoke south was fortunate, avoiding smoke buildup in the tunnel and leaving the northern entrance \u2013 nearest to the emergency response center of Bologna \u2013 relatively clear.\n\nA diesel-electric engine was brought from Bologna to recover the head section of the damaged train, allowing rescuers to reach the blown-up coach. Coaches of a rescue train were used as ambulances, ferrying the injured and taking them to San Benedetto Val di Sambro station. Underestimation of the scale of the incident led to only a single doctor being present on the rescue train. 15 ambulances took the critical patients to Bologna Ospedale Maggiore, with Polizia di Stato and Carabinieri escorts. \n\nA special plan, developed in the wake of bombings during previous years, including the Italicus Express bombing and the Bologna massacre, was activated for the first time. It was instrumental in providing a fast response: local police reserved some roads for ambulance routes, while coordination between responders was managed by Bologna Soccorso, a regional emergency management group evolved from the late CePIS (and which would eventually become the core of the national emergency response network).\n\nAfter letting off its first shipment of injured passengers, the train quickly got back to the tunnel and picked up the uninjured passengers, who were beginning to suffer from the cold wind. However, smoke from its diesel engines inadvertently filled the tunnel. Passengers and responders still inside the tunnel had to be provided with oxygen masks. After the train departed, a woman was found in shock in the tunnel cavity, and was taken on foot to the nearby Ca' di Landino station. Snow began to fall while the last passengers were evacuated.\n\n==Inquiry==\nWithin hours after the blast, a number of left and right-wing groups claimed responsibility. Official suspicion centered on neo-fascist terrorists, since the attack took place on the same railway stretch at which right-wing extremists bombed the Italicus train in 1974, killing twelve and wounding 48. The Public Prosecutor Office promptly began an inquiry. A chemical and ballistic survey was commissioned in order to find the kind of explosive used and the disaster dynamics. A witness was found: he saw two people placing two bags in the 9th car luggage rack in Florence station, so the inquiry was assigned to Florence prosecutors.\n\nIn March 1985, Mafia boss Giuseppe Cal\u00f2 and Guido Cercola were stopped in Rome and jailed for crimes related to drug trafficking. The hideout of Cal\u00f2 was found on May 11 in a small rural cottage near Poggio San Lorenzo in Rieti: searches found a suitcase in the cellar, containing two smaller cases within which there were batteries, a radio receiver, a radio transmitter, antennas, wires, weapons and explosives. This explosive was checked by forensic labs in Rome and Florence, and proved to be the same as the one used on Train 904.\n\nOn 9 January 1986, prosecutor Pierluigi Vigna charged Cal\u00f2 and Cercola with the massacre. According to the inquiry, the bombing was intended to distract the state security forces from investigating the Sicilian Mafia after the testimony of the Mafia turncoat Tommaso Buscetta to investigating Antimafia judge Giovanni Falcone had led to a series of arrest warrants in September 1984 that subsequently would lead to the Maxi Trial against 474 Mafia defendants.\n\nCercola was linked to a German, Friedrich Schaudinn, who built electronic devices to be used in bombings. Those devices were found in Pippo Cal\u00f2's home. Many links were found between Cal\u00f2, the Camorra and extreme right-wing neo-Fascist groups. Cal\u00f2 had ties with P2 masonic lodge and the Banda della Magliana, and was a well known to many Italian terrorists, including Cristiano and Valerio Fioravanti, Massimo Carminati and Walter Sordi.\n\n==Trials==\nThe Florence Criminal Court found Pippo Cal\u00f2, Cercola and people linked to them (Alfonso Galeota, Giulio Pirozzi and Camorra boss Giuseppe Misso) guilty on 25 February 1989, sentencing them to life imprisonment for massacre. Franco Di Agostino was sentenced to 28 years, Schaudinn to 25 and other involved in the inquiry received minor sentences. A second grade trial took place on March 15, 1990, in Florence by Giulio Catelani. Cal\u00f2 and Cercola's jail time was confirmed, and Di Agostino was given a life sentence. Misso, Pirozzi and Galeota were discharged in regard to the massacre, but found guilty of possession of explosives. Schaudinn was found not formally linked with Mafia, and his sentence for the massacre was revised to 22 years. \n\nOn 5 March 1991, the Corte di Cassazione presided by Corrado Carnevale unexpectedly voided the sentence. General Prosecutor Antonino Scopelliti was against the ruling, and called for a fair crime prosecution. Carnevale allowed a new trial of the suspects by the Florence court. Cal\u00f2 and Cercola sentences were confirmed, Di Agostino got 24 years, Schaudinn got 22. Misso's sentence was cut to three years; Galeota and Pirozzi sentence to eighteen months, their role in the massacre being deemed as marginal. \n\nThe same day, Galeota and Pirozzi, along with latter's wife Rita Casolaro and Misso's wife Assunta Sarno, were returning to Naples when their car was rammed on the A1 motorway near Afragola-Acerra exit. Killers sent by the Camorra clans opened fire, killing Galeota and Sarno (executed by a gunshot in the mouth). Giulio Pirozzi and his wife were saved by a police car which fortuitously passed on the opposite lane, causing the killers to flee. \n\nThe Corte di Cassazione confirmed the sentences on 24 November 1992, officially recognizing a \"coordinated hand by the Mafia\" in the disaster. On 18 February 1994, Florence Court discharged MSI member of Parliament Massimo Abbatangelo from the massacre charge, but deemed him guilty of giving the explosive to Misso in early 1984. Abbatangelo was sentenced to 6 years. Victims' relatives asked for a tougher sentence, but lost the appeal and had to pay for judiciary expenses.\n\nGuido Cercola killed himself in Sulmona's penitentiary on 3 January 2005. He strangled himself with shoelaces, and died while being rushed to hospital.\n\nOn 27 April 2011, the Antimafia Office of Naples issued a custody order against Mafia \"boss of bosses\" Tot\u00f2 Riina, the head of the Sicilian Mafia Commission, considering him the brains behind the massacre. Prosecutors said that the explosive used to carry out Train 904 attack were the same used to kill Antimafia judge Paolo Borsellino and his escort in via D'Amelio on July 19, 1992.\n\n==Casualty list==\nSource:\n* Giovanbattista Altobelli (51)\n* Anna Maria Brandi (26)\n* Angela Calvanese in De Simone (33)\n* Anna De Simone (9)\n* Giovanni De Simone (4)\n* Nicola De Simone (40)\n* Susanna Cavalli (22)\n* Lucia Cerrato (66)\n* Pier Francesco Leoni (23)\n* Luisella Matarazzo (25)\n* Carmine Moccia (30)\n* Valeria Moratello (22)\n* Maria Luigia Morini (45)\n* Federica Taglialatela (12)\n* Abramo Vastarella (29)\n* Gioacchino Taglialatela (50, died from his wounds)\n\n==See also==\n* List of massacres in Italy \n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/archiviostorico.corriere.it\/1992\/novembre\/25\/strage_Natale_ergastolo_boss_co_0_92112510569.shtml","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140812204924\/http:\/\/archiviostorico.corriere.it\/1992\/novembre\/25\/strage_Natale_ergastolo_boss_co_0_92112510569.shtml","http:\/\/www.ilfattoquotidiano.it\/2011\/04\/27\/rapido-904-il-mandante-fu-toto-riina-fu-il-primo-avviso-a-falcone-e-borsellino\/107348\/","http:\/\/www.ansa.it\/web\/notizie\/rubriche\/cronaca\/2011\/04\/27\/visualizza_new.html_896952856.html","http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/magazine\/article\/0,9171,956229,00.html","http:\/\/www.stragetreno904.com\/ST9\/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=56&Itemid=40","https:\/\/archive.today\/20130203051239\/http:\/\/www.stragetreno904.com\/ST9\/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=56&Itemid=40","http:\/\/www.reti-invisibili.net\/rapido904\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110724032444\/http:\/\/www.reti-invisibili.net\/rapido904\/","http:\/\/articles.latimes.com\/1985-01-21\/news\/mn-14207_1_twilight-world","http:\/\/www.apnewsarchive.com\/1989\/Court-Convicts-Seven-Acquits-Two-In-Train-Bombing\/id-ba81d9b2ead48297dad235f962ab0a3c","http:\/\/www.corriere.it\/cronache\/11_aprile_27\/riina-mandante-strage-treno904_8c008120-70a7-11e0-8d74-1cfa48373a9c.shtml","http:\/\/www.vittimeterrorismo.it\/memorie\/elenco_vit_stragi.htm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180312121924\/http:\/\/www.vittimeterrorismo.it\/memorie\/elenco_vit_stragi.htm"]}
{"title":"1984 United States embassy annex bombing in Beirut","article":"On September 20, 1984, the Shi'a Islamic militant group Hezbollah, with support and direction from the Islamic Republic of Iran, carried out a suicide car bombing targeting the U.S. embassy annex in East Beirut, Lebanon. The attack killed 24 people.\n\nHezbollah had also used suicide car or truck bombs in the April 1983 U.S. embassy bombing and the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings.\n\n==Bombing==\nIn July 1984, the U.S. had relocated its embassy operations from West Beirut to the relative security of Aukar, a Christian suburb of East Beirut. When on September 20, 1984, the attacker sped his van laden with 3,000 pounds (1360 kg) of explosives toward the six-story embassy, crucial security measures had not yet been completed at the complex, including a massive steel gate. The van was heading for the entrance of the diplomatic facility, but did not get within ten yards of the building after the driver was shot by a bodyguard of the British ambassador and Lebanese embassy guards and lost control of the vehicle. The vehicle detonated at 11:44 a.m. after striking a parked van.\n\nThe explosion \"ripped off the front of the embassy, shredding glass, bending steel bars and destroying cars in a nearby parking lot.\" The attack killed a total of 24 people (including the suicide bomber). Only two of the dead were American: Chief Warrant Officer Kenneth V. Welch of the U.S. Army and Petty Officer 1st Class Michael Ray Wagner of the U.S. Navy, who were both assigned to the U.S. Defense Attache Office in Beirut. The majority of those killed were Lebanese, \"either local employees or people seeking visas\". Of the injured, the U.S. Ambassador, Reginald Bartholomew, was slightly hurt, as well as the British Ambassador, David Miers, who was meeting with Bartholomew at the time of explosion.\n\n==Responsibility==\nThe Islamic Jihad Organization (IJO) claimed responsibility for the attack in a telephone call a few hours after the explosion. The caller said, \"The operation goes to prove that we will carry out our previous promise not to allow a single American to remain on Lebanese soil.\" The U.S. government understood that Hezbollah had carried out the attack under the cover name of IJO with the support of Iran. Through satellite reconnaissance, U.S. intelligence discovered that a mock-up of the annex had been created at the Iranian Revolutionary Guard-run Sheikh Abdullah barracks in Baalbek to practice for the attack.\n\n==Legal cases==\nUnder the amended Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, victims of the bombing and their families have filed cases against the Islamic Republic of Iran, holding it responsible for its role in the attack and demanding compensation.\n* Estate of Doe, et al. v Republic of Iran, et al. (2013) \u2013 58 foreign national employees and one American employee that were killed or injured in the 1983 embassy bombing and 1984 embassy annex bombing are awarded $8.4 billion. The judge ruled \"that the attacks were carried out by the terrorist group Islamic Jihad, known most commonly as Hezbollah, operating with Iranian support and encouragement.\"\n* Brewer v. Islamic Republic of Iran (2009) \u2013 Security guard Richard Brewer and his family are awarded $310 million in damages. Brewer was injured in the bombing. The judge ruled \"Hezbollah received substantial funds and support from Iran via its Ministry of Information and Security and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. This court concludes that defendants provided 'material support and resources' to Hezbollah.\"\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1984\/09\/24\/world\/neighbors-of-embassy-say-they-re-in-danger.html","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/sacredragewratho00wrig_0","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/sacredragewratho00wrig_0\/page\/106","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1984\/09\/21\/world\/23-die-including-2-americans-terrorist-car-bomb-attack-us-embassy-beirut-blast.html?pagewanted=all","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=6WarAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=hezbollah%20matthew%20levitt&pg=PA23","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=V0G9f35dK6AC&lpg=PT131&dq=1984%20annex%20iran&pg=PT131","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=0ckzAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA84","http:\/\/www.investigativeproject.org\/4013\/dc-judge-awards-hizballah-victims-84-billion","https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/apps\/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=awtl7EXPYdxo"]}
{"title":"Alfortville Armenian Genocide Memorial bombings","article":"The Alfortville Armenian Genocide Memorial bombing was a hit-team headed attack undertaken by Grey Wolves member Abdullah \u00c7atli and paid for by the Turkish National Intelligence Organization. It occurred on 3 May 1984, in a heavily Armenian populated district of Alfortville, Val-de-Marne, \u00cele-de-France.\n\nThe target chosen for the attack was a memorial dedicated to the victims of the Armenian Genocide on the rue \u00c9tienne Dolet which was inaugurated on 24 April 1984, the 69th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. The Turkish press denounced the monument as a \"monument of hate\". About a week after the inauguration, three bombs were reported to have exploded on 3 May 1984, resulting in thirteen injuries, two of them serious. The monument, made of Khachkar stone, was severely damaged in the blasts. The mayor of Alfortville at the time, Joseph Franceschi, who was also the Secretary of State for Public Security, condemned the attack. Jean Poperen, who was the National Secretary for the Socialist Party of France, also condemned the attack and expressed his solidarity with the Armenians of France.\n\nAn investigation was begun immediately after the attack.  It was later reported by one newspaper that the attack was operated by the Turkish National Intelligence Organization or M\u0130T. The memorial bombing came after several bombings that occurred against Armenian institutions and monuments throughout France, such as the bombing of the Armenian Cultural Center in Alfortville in 1983.\n\nA second attack occurred during the evening of 13 April 2002; three unknown assailants threw three molotov cocktails at the monument, causing the monument to be severely damaged. The attack occurred within days of the 87th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. An investigation was launched by the local Alfortville police but the assailants were never caught.\n\n==See also==\n*Anti-Armenianism\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/encyclopediaofmo0000atki\/page\/110","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/encyclopediaofmo0000atki\/page\/110","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=PAU5AAAAMAAJ&q","http:\/\/www.todayszaman.com\/tz-web\/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=150621","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20080824065057\/http:\/\/www.todayszaman.com\/tz-web\/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=150621","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=qOwzAAAAIAAJ&q","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=UDAWAQAAMAAJ&q","http:\/\/asbarez.com\/46731\/armenian-genocide-monument-in-french-city-damaged\/"]}
{"title":"1985 Beirut car bombings","article":"On 8 March 1985, a car bomb exploded between 9 and 45 metres from the house of Islamic cleric Sayyed Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah in Beirut, Lebanon, in a failed assassination attempt organized by the American CIA. The bombing killed more than 80 people and injured 200, almost all civilians.\n\nThree other car bombs also exploded in Beirut in 1985: on 22 May, 14 August and 18 August.\n\n==The blast==\nThe bomb explosion, estimated to have been equivalent to 200\u00a0kg (440\u00a0lbs) of dynamite, occurred in the western Beirut suburb of Bir al-Abed, outside an apartment building.  It killed worshippers, mostly women and girls, leaving Friday prayer services at an adjacent mosque, and destroyed two 7-story apartment buildings and a cinema.\n\nWhile several of Fadlallah's bodyguards were killed in the attack, the cleric escaped injury as he was attending Friday prayers at a nearby mosque.\n\nLocals fired guns in the air, following the blast, trying to clear the roads to allow ambulances to pass. A banner was strung across the blast site by locals, reading \"Made in USA.\"\n\n==Historical context==\nIn 1976, Gerald Ford became the first U.S. President to forbid political assassination, in the wake of the Church Commission, issuing Executive Order 11905. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan strengthened the policy with Executive Order 12333, which decreed that \"No person employed by or acting on behalf of the United States Government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, assassination.\" This Executive Order remains in effect today.\n\nThe Beirut car bombing occurred \"within the continuously evolving framework of an American 'preemption' counterterror program\". Following the 1983 United States embassy bombing and the 1984 U.S. embassy annex bombing, the U.S. military considered a range of retaliatory options, but it was unclear that these would have any deterrent value. On 14 November 1983, U.S.President Ronald Reagan authorized a retaliatory strike, but Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger did not authorize U.S. aircraft to take off for reasons that have not been disclosed. CIA director William Casey, along with CIA General Counsel Stanley Sporkin, favored the use of preemptive counter-terrorism practices in Lebanon; others, including Deputy Director of Central Intelligence John N. McMahon, did not approve of the strategy, concerned that it would violate Executive Order 12333.\n\n==Responsibility==\n\n\nThe U.S. National Security Advisor, Robert McFarlane, stated that those responsible for the bomb may have had American training, but asserted that they were \"rogue operative[s],\" and the CIA in no way sanctioned or supported the attack. Woodward's own account of his conversation with Casey suggests that Casey's action was \"off the books\".\n\nA former CIA operative maintains that the failed 1985 attempt tarnished the CIA's reputation.\n\n==Other bombings==\nA car bomb on 22 May killed 48 people. Another on 14 August killed 15 people. Another on 18 August went off in a Christian suburb of East Beirut. The dynamites caused the death of fifty people. It was one of the worst explosions to take place in the city's east, which was relatively calm compared to the west.\n\n==In Literature==\n\nThe car bombing is described in Ken Follet's 2014 historical novel \"Edge of Eternity\"  (Chapter 57).\n\n==See also==\n* Hezbollah\n* Internal Security Forces\n* Lebanese Army\n* Lebanese Civil War\n* Lebanese Forces \u2013 Executive Command\n* South Lebanon Army\n* Mountain War (Lebanon)\n* Young Men (Lebanon)\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/fromthearchive\/story\/0,,1432945,00.html","http:\/\/www.atimes.com\/atimes\/Front_Page\/HD18Aa01.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110522124156\/http:\/\/www.atimes.com\/atimes\/Front_Page\/HD18Aa01.html","http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/magazine\/article\/0,9171,957011-1,00.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20080521010607\/http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/magazine\/article\/0,9171,957011-1,00.html","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/onthisday\/hi\/dates\/stories\/march\/8\/newsid_2516000\/2516407.stm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20101223192414\/http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/onthisday\/hi\/dates\/stories\/march\/8\/newsid_2516000\/2516407.stm","http:\/\/www.fff.org\/freedom\/fd0406c.asp","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20060821215232\/http:\/\/www.fff.org\/freedom\/fd0406c.asp","http:\/\/www.pnsr.org\/data\/images\/chasdi%20-%20case%20of%20the%20fadlallah%20assassination%20attempt.pdf","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110921044608\/http:\/\/www.pnsr.org\/data\/images\/chasdi%20-%20case%20of%20the%20fadlallah%20assassination%20attempt.pdf","https:\/\/foreignpolicy.com\/articles\/2012\/10\/09\/dont_just_do_something","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20121011235135\/http:\/\/www.foreignpolicy.com\/articles\/2012\/10\/09\/dont_just_do_something","https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/wgbh\/pages\/frontline\/shows\/target\/etc\/cron.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20070124072452\/http:\/\/www.pbs.org\/wgbh\/pages\/frontline\/shows\/target\/etc\/cron.html","http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/printout\/0,8816,965712,00.html","https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/wgbh\/pages\/frontline\/shows\/target\/interviews\/woodward.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20121126194038\/http:\/\/www.pbs.org\/wgbh\/pages\/frontline\/shows\/target\/interviews\/woodward.html","https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/2020\/02\/10\/qassem-suleimani-and-how-nations-decide-to-kill<\/ref>","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1985\/08\/18\/world\/car-bomb-kills-50-in-christian-area-near-east-beirut.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180709194108\/https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1985\/08\/18\/world\/car-bomb-kills-50-in-christian-area-near-east-beirut.html"]}
{"title":"El Descanso bombing","article":"On 12 April 1985, the El Descanso restaurant in Madrid, Spain was bombed in a terrorist attack. The explosion caused the three-story building to collapse, crashing down on about 200 diners and employees, killing 18 people, all Spanish citizens, and injuring 82 others, including eleven Americans working at the nearby Torrej\u00f3n Air Base who frequented the restaurant. At the time it was the worst attack in Spain since the Spanish Civil War.\n\n==Bombing==\nAt about 22:30, a bomb exploded in the El Descanso-La Casa de las Costillas restaurant, causing the three-story building housing the restaurant to collapse. The building crashed down on about 200 diners and employees present in the restaurant, killing 18 people and injuring 82. Fifteen American servicemen of the nearby American Torrej\u00f3n Air Base were among the injured, but while being frequented by air base staff the timing of the bomb occurred at an hour few Americans typically were present. The police investigation concluded that the explosion was caused by a 13-pound chloratite bomb planted near the bathroom of the restaurant, consisting of a chemical compound made up of potassium, sulfur and chlorate, a type of explosive said to be rarely used by domestic Spanish terrorist groups.\n\n==Investigation==\nGroups claiming responsibility for the attack included Basque separatist group ETA, the First of October Anti-Fascist Resistance Groups (GRAPO), Unity of the Abu Zeinab Martyrs, Wa'd (a front of the PFLP-SC) and the Islamic Jihad Organization. The callers from ETA claimed the bomb had gone off earlier than planned and that the bombing was meant to target American soldiers who would have been in the restaurant later, and apologised to the victims of the bombing.\n\nAfter first blaming ETA, Spanish Interior Minister Jos\u00e9 Barrionuevo concluded the Islamic Jihad Organization and Wa'd had the most credible claim of responsibility following investigations by the National Police. The claim by Wa'd, distributed by the Kuwait News Agency was noted as it included the anagram of the sugar envelopes from the El Descanso restaurant. ETA was also known to have had ties to extremists in Lebanon and Syria where they had access to training camps, and investigators suspected links between Islamic Jihad, ETA and GRAPO. Islamic Jihad had itself been implicated in several attacks in Spain the previous year, including a machinegun attack on a Kuwaiti newspaper publisher and the killing and wounding of two Saudi Arabians, both attacks in Marbella, and the shooting of a Lebanese embassy employee in Madrid.\n\nAccording to the El Pa\u00eds newspaper and the Group of Strategic Studies, which cite the attack as \"the first attack of Islamist terrorism in Spain,\" the credibility of Islamic Jihad eventually gained weight, also as a letter circulated two weeks after the bombing stated: \"Islam is ready. Spain and Italy are the first targets. The attack in Madrid has been the beginning of the Islamic holy war. Death to the United States. The apostles of death are ready to resume the holy war.\"\n\n==Later developments==\nThe case was closed in 1987 due to a lack of arrests. Only the claim by the Islamic Jihad Organisation was included in the closing summary. In 1992 judge Baltasar Garz\u00f3n made enquiries into the Marbella-based Syrian arms dealer Monzer al-Kassar who was linked to numerous crimes including the Achille Lauro hijacking, without results.\n\nIn 2005, Spain requested the Muslim Brotherhood and alleged al-Qaeda operative Mustafa Setmariam Nasar's extradition from Pakistan for his alleged role in the bombing after a witness report after Nasar became a suspect in the 2004 Madrid train bombings. In addition to witness accounts following the Madrid attacks, a composite sketch of the suspect produced from accounts of American servicemen immediately following the El Descanso bombing allegedly resembled Setmariam.\n\n==See also==\n*Madrid airline office attacks\n*Bar Iruna attack\n*Rhein-Main Air Base bombing\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/archive\/politics\/1985\/04\/15\/spain-names-islamic-jihad-in-bombing\/2f18881b-a8b8-45ce-981a-da894e207a91\/","https:\/\/www.upi.com\/Archives\/1985\/04\/14\/Islamic-Jihad-suspected-in-terrorist-blast\/7243482302800\/","https:\/\/books.google.no\/books?id=T3bAfe2xIH0C&lpg=PP1&hl=no&pg=PA184","http:\/\/www.gees.org\/articulos\/atentado-en-el-restaurante-el-descanso-la-primera-senal-del-terrorismo-islamista-en-espana","https:\/\/elpais.com\/diario\/2010\/04\/18\/domingo\/1271562760_850215.html","https:\/\/books.google.no\/books?id=UgoxCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&hl=no&pg=PA58","https:\/\/books.google.no\/books?id=-wwPNjSnxcYC&lpg=PP1&hl=no&pg=PA708","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1985\/04\/13\/world\/restaurant-blast-in-spain-kills-17-near-us-air-base.html","http:\/\/www.abc.es\/20100413\/historia-\/atentado-torrejon-1985-islamismo-201004121803.html","http:\/\/www.expatica.com\/es\/news\/local_news\/al-qaeda-suspect-linked-to-1985-madrid-bombing-25187.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20120309172444\/http:\/\/www.expatica.com\/es\/news\/local_news\/al-qaeda-suspect-linked-to-1985-madrid-bombing-25187.html"]}
{"title":"1985 Frankfurt airport bombing","article":"On 19 June 1985, a bombing at the Frankfurt Airport, West Germany, killed three and wounded 74 people. A second bomb was found and defused not far from the first explosion. Two of those killed were Australian children, 2-year-old and 5-year-old siblings, and the third a Portuguese man.\n\nAbout 30 groups claimed responsibility, among them an unprecedented group calling itself Arab Revolutionary Organisation, having done so because of West German intelligence recruiting Arabs to assassinate members of Arab revolutionary movements in Lebanon. In July 1988, West German investigators concluded that the Palestinian Abu Nidal Organization, which itself had also claimed responsibility, had perpetrated the attack, and that the Libyan embassy in Bonn had pre-knowledge of the attack.

{"title":"Rhein-Main Air Base bombing","article":"Stars & Stripes article on Rhein-Main car bomb 1985\nThe Rhein-Main Air Base bombing was a terrorist car bomb attack against the American Rhein-Main Air Base near Frankfurt am Main in West Germany on 8 August 1985. Two Americans were killed and 23 people, including Germans, were injured. The blast was powerful caused debris and damage to the base including to 30 vehicles, trees and windows.\n\nThe attack was orchestrated by the left-wing Red Army Faction (RAF) and the French Action Directe groups. It was the worst attack on an American installation in Germany since Ramstein Air Base was bombed in 1981, also by the RAF. The attack came less than two months after the Frankfurt airport bombing, although the two were not related.\n\nIn preparation for the attack, RAF members lured and killed American soldier Edward Pimental in Wiesbaden. They used Pimental's identification to gain entry into the air base the next day where they carried out the attack. The bomb was placed in a Volkswagen Passat with fake American military plates.\n\n==Victims==\nOne of the fatal victims of the attack was 19-year-old Airman Frank H. Scarton from Woodhaven, Michigan, who was on temporary duty in West Germany and normally serving at Charleston Air Force Base in South Carolina. The other victim was Becky Jo Bristol of San Antonio, Texas, the wife of Senior Airman John Bristol, who served at the Rhein-Main base.\n\n==Aftermath==\nA White House spokesman called it a \"shameful attack\".\n\nEva Haule, leader of the RAF, was arrested in 1986. In 1993, by now already serving a 15-year prison sentence for other terror offences, she was tried for the Rhein-Main base attack. Her defending lawyer claimed the attack was a \u2033legitimate means of resistance against American imperialism\u2033. She was released on parole in 2007.\n\n==See also==\n*West Berlin discotheque bombing\n*1987 Rheindahlen bombing\n*1988 Naples bombing\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1985\/08\/09\/world\/car-bomb-kills-2-on-a-us-air-base-in-west-germany.html","http:\/\/articles.chicagotribune.com\/1985-08-09\/news\/8502210903_1_437th-military-airlift-wing-rhein-air-force","https:\/\/apnews.com\/8f0e3c65f630bad47bc43c0587a610cb","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/world\/europe\/6955032.stm"]}
{"title":"West Berlin discotheque bombing","article":"On 5 April 1986, three people were killed and 229 injured when La Belle discoth\u00e8que was bombed in the Friedenau district of West Berlin. The entertainment venue was commonly frequented by United States soldiers, and two of the dead and 79 of the injured were Americans.\n\nA bomb placed under a table near the disc jockey's booth exploded at 01:45 CET, instantly killing Nermin Hannay, a Turkish woman, and US Army sergeant Kenneth T. Ford. A second US Army sergeant, James E. Goins, died from his injuries two months later. Some of the victims were left permanently disabled due to the injuries caused by the explosion.\n\nLibya was accused by the US government of sponsoring the bombing, and US President Ronald Reagan ordered retaliatory strikes on Tripoli and Benghazi in Libya ten days later. The operation was widely seen as an attempt to kill Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. A 2001 trial in the US found that the bombing had been \"planned by the Libyan Intelligence Service and the Libyan embassy\".\n\n==Blame and retribution==\nLibya was blamed for the bombing after Telex messages from Tripoli to the country's embassy in East Berlin congratulating them on a job well done were intercepted. President Ronald Reagan retaliated by ordering airstrikes against the Libyan capital of Tripoli and city of Benghazi. At least 30 soldiers and 15 civilians were killed. A 2001 trial in the US found that the bombing had been \"planned by the Libyan secret service and the Libyan Embassy\".\n\n==Trial and conviction==\nIn spite of reports blaming Libya for the attack on the nightclub, no individual was officially accused of the bombing until the 1990 reunification of Germany and the subsequent opening up of the Stasi archives. Stasi files led German prosecutor Detlev Mehlis to Musbah Abdulghasem Eter, a Libyan who had worked at the Libyan embassy in East Berlin. Stasi files listed him as an agent, and Mehlis said he was the Libyan spy agency's main contact at the embassy.\n\nEter and four other suspects were arrested in 1996 in Lebanon, Italy, Greece, and Berlin, and put on trial a year later. In 2001, Eter and two Palestinians, Yasser Mohammed Chreidi (or Yassar Al-Shuraidi or Yassir Chraidi) and Ali Chanaa were convicted in Berlin's Landgericht of aiding in murder, and Chanaa's former German wife, Verena, was convicted of murder. They were given sentences of 12 to 14 years in prison.\n\nProsecutor Mehlis proved beyond reasonable doubt that the three men had assembled the bomb in the Chanaas' flat. The explosive was said to have been brought into West Berlin in a Libyan diplomatic bag. Verena Chanaa and her sister, Andrea H\u00e4usler, carried it into the La Belle in a travel bag and left five minutes before it exploded. Ms H\u00e4usler was acquitted because it could not be proven that she knew a bomb was in the bag.\n\n==Background to the bombing==\nThe judge, Peter Marhofer, said it was not clear whether Gaddafi or Libyan intelligence had actually ordered the attack, though there were indications that they had. Two weeks before the bombing, Gaddafi called for Arab assaults on American interests worldwide after a U.S.-Libyan naval clash in the Mediterranean, in which 35 seamen on a Libyan patrol boat in the western Gulf of Sidra were killed in international waters claimed by the Libyan government.\n\nChreidi was eventually extradited from Lebanon to Germany in connection with the bombing. He had been working for the Libyan Peoples' Bureau in East Berlin at the time of the bombing. Chreidi was said to have connections with Palestinian fighter Abu Nidal, who used to live in Tripoli and was financed by Libya in the 1980s. Eter was reported to be the Libyan spy agency's point man at the embassy in East Berlin.\n\n==Compensation==\nOn 17 August 2003, newspapers reported that Libya had signaled to the German government that it was ready to negotiate compensation for the bombing with lawyers for non-U.S. victims. A year later, on 10 August 2004, Libya concluded an agreement to pay a total of $35 million compensation.\n\nIn October 2008, Libya paid $1.5 billion into a fund to compensate relatives of the following:\n#Lockerbie bombing victims with the remaining 20% of the sum agreed in 2003;\n#American victims of the West Berlin discotheque bombing;\n#American victims of the 1989 UTA Flight 772 bombing; and,\n#Libyan victims of the 1986 US bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi.\n\n==See also==\n\n*List of terrorist incidents in 1986\n*Operation El Dorado Canyon\n*Gulf of Sidra incident (1989)\n*Gulf of Sidra incident (1981)\n*Pan Am Flight 73\n*Pan Am Flight 103\n*UTA Flight 772\n*1988 Naples bombing\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n\n* BBC Flashback: The Berlin disco bombing\n* La Belle victims' website\n* Operation El Dorado Canyon\n* 'La Belle' verdict favours Libya\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemorial plaque reading, \"On the 5th of April, 1986, young people were murdered inside this building by a criminal bombing.\".","urls":["https:\/\/apnews.com\/65d7ca6f461f4c7a8efd8c6d290e3b29","https:\/\/www.findagrave.com\/memorial\/5955147\/james-e-goins","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/europe\/1653848.stm","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/europe\/1653848.stm","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/onthisday\/hi\/dates\/stories\/april\/15\/newsid_3975000\/3975455.stm","http:\/\/www.history.com\/this-day-in-history\/us-bombs-libya","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180903123315\/https:\/\/www.history.com\/this-day-in-history\/us-bombs-libya","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/11\/14\/world\/4-guilty-in-fatal-1986-berlin-disco-bombing-linked-to-libya.html","http:\/\/www.afrol.com\/News2001\/liy002_la_belle.htm","http:\/\/www.hrr-strafrecht.de\/hrr\/5\/03\/5-306-03.php3","https:\/\/archive.today\/20120722005238\/http:\/\/www.berlinonline.de\/berliner-zeitung\/archiv\/.bin\/dump.fcgi\/1996\/0515\/politik\/0223\/index.html","http:\/\/www.morgenpost.de\/printarchiv\/politik\/article375400\/Entschaedigung_nach_18_Jahren.html","https:\/\/www.faz.net\/","http:\/\/www.germany-info.org\/relaunch\/politics\/\/new\/pol_libya_labelle_2004.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20080828235054\/http:\/\/www.germany-info.org\/relaunch\/politics\/\/new\/pol_libya_labelle_2004.html","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/world\/americas\/7703110.stm"]}
{"title":"1986 Damascus bombings","article":"The 1986 Damascus bombings were a series of terrorist attacks perpetrated in Damascus, Syria in 1986. They were the deadliest acts of terrorism against civilians since the quelling of the Islamist uprising in Syria in 1982. The bombings appeared to be aimed at destabilizing the Syrian government under Hafez al-Assad with links being between the suspected perpetrators and Iraq.\n\n==Bombings==\nOn 13 March 1986, a truck bomb detonated under a bridge in a Damascus suburb, killing 60 people and injuring 100 more. A month later, 144 were killed by a series of bombings in five towns and cities across Syria, including Damascus, with buses being a prime target.\n\n==Alleged perpetrators==\nImmediately after the March bombing, the Syrian government placed the blame on Iraq, citing their desire to destabilize the regime. After the April 1986 bombings claimed the lives of an additional 144 people, a previously unknown group with pro-Iraq sympathies calling themselves the 17 October Group for the Liberation of the Syrian People, claimed responsibility.

{"title":"Remembrance Day bombing","article":"The Remembrance Day bombing (also known as the Enniskillen bombing or Poppy Day massacre) took place on 8 November 1987 in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. A Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) bomb exploded near the town's war memorial (cenotaph) during a Remembrance Sunday ceremony, which was being held to commemorate British military war dead. Eleven people (ten civilians and a police officer) were killed, many of them elderly, and 63 were injured. The IRA said it had made a mistake and that its target had been the British soldiers parading to the memorial.\n\nThe bombing was strongly condemned by all sides and undermined support for the IRA and Sinn F\u00e9in. It also facilitated the passing of the Extradition Act, which made it easier to extradite IRA suspects from the Republic of Ireland to the United Kingdom. Loyalist paramilitaries responded to the bombing with revenge attacks on Catholic civilians. The bombing is often seen as a turning point in the Troubles, an incident that shook the IRA \"to its core\", and spurred on new efforts by Irish nationalists towards a political solution to the conflict.\n\n==Background and planning==\nThe IRA said that the bombing was an attempt to kill British soldiers. It has also been suggested that it was partly a retaliation for the alleged harassment of republican memorial services by the security forces. A week before the bombing, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) clashed with mourners at the funeral of IRA volunteers Eddie McSheffrey and Paddy Deery. When an IRA gunman fired a three-volley salute over the coffins, police baton charged and fired plastic bullets into the crowd. One of the coffins was knocked to the ground and a number of civilians and officers were injured.\n\nThe bombing was thought by the British and Irish security forces to have involved at least two IRA units, from both sides of the border. Although IRA units were given \"a degree of operational autonomy\" at the time, they believed that such a bombing must have been sanctioned by IRA Northern Command. However, a high-ranking IRA member said that it was suggested by IRA men at the local level and sanctioned by a \"middle level\" officer. \n\nDenzil McDaniel, author of Enniskillen: The Remembrance Sunday Bombing, later interviewed security and IRA contacts, putting together an account of the bombers' movements. He wrote that the  bomb was made in Ballinamore, County Leitrim, and brought to Enniskillen by up to thirty IRA volunteers, moving in relay teams to avoid security patrols. It is thought to have taken over 24 hours to transport the bomb. On the night of 7 November, the bomb\u2014hidden in a sports bag\u2014was left at the gable wall inside the town's Reading Rooms, and set to explode at 10:43AM the next day, minutes before the ceremony was to start. The security forces searched the route of the planned military parade for explosives, but did not search the Reading Rooms as it was thought to be a \"secure area\".\n\n==Explosion==\n\nThe bomb exploded as a parade of Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldiers was making its way to the memorial and as people waited for the ceremony to begin. It blew out the wall of the Reading Rooms, where many of the victims were standing, burying them under rubble and hurling masonry towards the gathered crowd. Bystanders rushed to free those trapped underneath.\n\nEleven people were killed, including three married couples. The dead were Wesley and Bertha Armstrong (aged 62 and 55), Kit and Jessie Johnston (aged 71 and 62), William and Agnes Mullan (aged 74 and 73), John Megaw (67), Alberta Quinton (72), Marie Wilson (20), Samuel Gault (49) and Edward Armstrong (52). Edward Armstrong was a serving RUC officer and Gault had recently left the force. Gordon Wilson, whose daughter Marie died in the blast and who was himself injured, went on to become a peace campaigner and member of Seanad \u00c9ireann. The twelfth fatality, Ronnie Hill, died after spending 13\u00a0years in a coma. Sixty-three people were injured, including thirteen children, some of them permanently. Ulster Unionist politicians Sammy Foster and Jim Dixon were among the crowd; the latter received extensive head injuries but recovered. A local businessman captured the immediate aftermath of the bombing on video camera. His footage, showing the effects of the bombing, was broadcast on international television. All the victims were Protestant.\n\nA few hours after the blast, the IRA called a radio station and said it had abandoned a  bomb in Tullyhommon,  away, after it failed to detonate. That morning, a Remembrance Sunday parade (which included many members of the Boys' and Girls' Brigades) had unwittingly gathered near the Tullyhommon bomb. Soldiers and RUC officers had also been there, and the IRA said it attempted to trigger the bomb when soldiers were standing beside it. It was defused by security forces and was found to have a command wire leading to a firing point across the border.\n\n==Reactions==\nThe IRA apologised, saying it had made a mistake and that the target had been the UDR soldiers who were parading to the memorial.\n\nDenzil McDaniel, author of Enniskillen: The Remembrance Sunday Bombing, commented: \"I don't believe the IRA set out to specifically kill civilians. I think they made mistakes, probably with their intelligence on the timetable for the service, but the IRA was reckless about civilian life\". RUC Detective Chief Superintendent Norman Baxter said: \"Their intention was to inflict casualties. The only mistake in the operation was that the bomb went off before the parade arrived\". Many Irish nationalists and Republicans were horrified by the bombing and described it as a blow to the Republican cause. Sinn F\u00e9in's weekly newspaper, An Phoblacht, criticised the bombing, calling it a \"monumental error\" that would strengthen the IRA's opponents. The IRA disbanded the unit responsible.\n\nThe bombing led to an outcry among politicians in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said: \"It's really desecrating the dead and a blot on mankind\". The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Tom King, denounced the \"outrage\" in the House of Commons, as did the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Brian Lenihan in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (the lower house of the Oireachtas, the Republic's legislature), while in Seanad \u00c9ireann Senator Maurice Manning spoke of people's \"total revulsion\". Many public figures used terms such as \"barbarism\" and \"savagery\" to describe the bombing.\n\nThe bombing was seen by many Northern Irish Protestants as an attack on them, and loyalist paramilitaries retaliated with attacks on Catholic civilians. The day after, five Catholic teenagers were wounded in a shooting in Belfast, and a Protestant teenager was killed by the Ulster Defence Association after being mistaken for a Catholic. In the week after the bombing, there were 14 gun and bomb attacks on Catholics in Belfast.\n\nIrish band U2 were holding a concert in Denver, Colorado, US the same day. During a performance of their song \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", singer Bono passionately condemned the bombing, stating \"fuck the revolution\" in his mid-song speech, as well as criticising the armchair republicanism of many Irish-Americans and stating that the majority of people in his country did not want \"the revolution\". The footage is included in U2's rockumentary Rattle and Hum. Simple Minds had a number 1 single in the UK with \"Belfast Child\", inspired by the bombing.\n\n==Long-term results==\n\nAt the time, the British and Irish governments were negotiating an Extradition Act that would make it easier to extradite IRA suspects from the Republic to the UK. The Act was to come before the Irish parliament less than a month after the bombing. The Irish government wanted the British to reform the justice system in Northern Ireland (such as by abolishing \"Diplock courts\") before it would pass the Act. Many in the Republic insisted that the Act should only be passed after the reforms took place. However, after the bombing, opposition to the Act dwindled and it was passed by the Irish Parliament, albeit with some changes.\n\nThe bombing is often seen as a turning point in the Troubles. It undermined support for the IRA's campaign, both locally and internationally. Crucially, the Gaddafi regime in Libya withdrew its support and with it the supply of weapons and ammunition to the IRA. The bombing also harmed Sinn F\u00e9in's electoral support. In 1989, in the first local elections held after the bombing, Sinn F\u00e9in lost four of its eight seats on Fermanagh District Council and was overtaken by the SDLP as the biggest Irish nationalist party there. It was not until 2001, fourteen years after the bombing, that Sinn F\u00e9in support returned to its 1985 level. The bombing drove new efforts by Irish nationalists towards a political solution to the conflict. It led to the resumption of talks between Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams and SDLP leader John Hume, paving the way for formal talks between the two parties and the beginnings of the Northern Ireland peace process. In 1997, Adams apologised for the bombing on behalf of the republican movement.\n\nEnniskillen's Remembrance Day service was re-staged two weeks after the bombing, and attended by about 5,000 people, including British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The site of the bomb, which was owned by the Catholic Church, was rebuilt as The Clinton Centre, a youth hostel, in 2002.

{"title":"Loughgall ambush","article":"The Loughgall ambush took place on 8 May 1987 in the village of Loughgall, County Armagh, Northern Ireland. An eight-man unit of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) launched an attack on the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) base in the village. An IRA member drove a digger with a bomb in its bucket through the perimeter fence, while the rest of the unit arrived in a van and fired on the building. The bomb exploded and destroyed almost half of the base. Soldiers from the British Army's Special Air Service (SAS) then returned fire both from within the base and from hidden positions around it in a pre-planned ambush, killing all of the IRA attackers. Two of them were subsequently found to have been unarmed when they were killed.\n\nA civilian was also killed and another wounded by the SAS after unwittingly driving into the ambush zone and being mistaken for IRA attackers.\n\nThe joint British Army\/RUC operation was codenamed Operation Judy. It was the IRA's biggest loss of life in a single incident during the Troubles.\n\n==Background and preparations==\nThe IRA's East Tyrone Brigade was active mainly in eastern County Tyrone and neighbouring parts of County Armagh. By the mid-1980s it had become one of the IRA's most aggressive formations. Members of the unit, such as Jim Lynagh and P\u00e1draig McKearney, advocated a strategy of destroying bases and preventing them being rebuilt or repaired in an attempt to \"deny ground\" to British forces. In 1985, Patrick Joseph Kelly became its commander and began implementing the strategy. In 1985 and 1986, it carried out two major attacks on Royal Ulster Constabulary bases. The first was an attack on the RUC barracks in Ballygawley on 7 December 1985, in which two police officers were shot dead. The second was an attack on an RUC base at The Birches on 11 August 1986. In both attacks, the bases were raked with machine-gun fire and then severely damaged with homemade bombs. In the attack at The Birches, they had breached the base's perimeter fence with a digger that had a bomb in its bucket. It was planned to use the same tactic in an attack on the lightly-manned Loughgall base.\n\nThe British security forces however had received intelligence weeks prior to the attack of the IRA's plan and at least 10 days before of the target. It is believed that this was obtained by RUC Special Branch and the British Army's Special Reconnaissance Unit (SRU). It has been alleged that the security forces had a double agent inside the IRA unit, and that he was killed by the SAS in the ambush. Other sources claim that the security forces had instead learned of the ambush through other surveillance methods. In his book, Terrorism: Inside A World Phenomenon, Barry Davies states that the date and time of the attack was eventually confirmed by a telephone tap. According to historian and former Professor of Politics at Queen's University Belfast Richard English, information of the attack had not come from within the unit, though Tony Gormley was known to security forces as a well-paid Special Branch informant.\n\nThree local RUC officers worked at the station, which was only open part-time, from 09:00 to 11:00, and from 17:00 to 19:00 daily. On the day of the attack, two RUC Headquarters Mobile Support Unit (HMSU) officers were placed in the station to accompany the local RUC officer who was to carry on the normal running of the station. The HMSU was the RUC's police tactical unit. Six SAS soldiers in plain clothes, including the commander, were positioned inside. Another eighteen SAS soldiers in uniform were hidden in five locations in wooded areas around the station.\n\nThe IRA's attack involved two teams. One team was to drive a digger with a bomb in its bucket through the base's perimeter fence and light the fuse. At the same time, another team would arrive in a van and open fire on the base, with the aim of killing the three RUC officers as they came off duty. Both teams would then leave the area in the van. To avoid security checkpoints, the bomb was ferried by boat across Lough Neagh, from Ardboe to Maghery. The van and digger that would be used were hijacked in the hours leading up to the attack. The van, a blue Toyota HiAce, was stolen by masked men from a business in Dungannon. At about the same time, the unit's commander Jim Lynagh was spotted in the town, suggesting the van might be used in the attack. The digger (a backhoe loader) was taken from a farm at Lislasly Road, about two miles west of Loughgall. Two IRA members stayed at the farm to stop the owners raising the alarm. Declan Arthurs drove the digger, while two others drove ahead of him in a scout car. The rest of the unit travelled in the van from another location, presumably also with a scout car. When a covert observation post monitoring the digger reported that it was being moved, the SAS took up its positions.\n\n==Ambush==\nThe IRA unit arrived in Loughgall from the north-east shortly after 19:00, when the station was scheduled to close for the night. They were armed and wearing bulletproof vests, boilersuits, gloves and balaclavas. The digger drove past the police station, turned around and drove back again with the Toyota van carrying the main IRA assault party doing the same. Not seeing any activity in the station in their two slow passes of it, members of the IRA unit felt that something was amiss, and debated whether to continue, but decided to go ahead with the attack. Tony Gormley and Gerard O'Callaghan got out of the van and joined Declan Arthurs on the digger, according to journalist Peter Taylor, \"literally riding shotgun\", with weapons in one hand and a lighter in the other. At about 7:15 Arthurs drove the digger towards the station. In the front bucket was 300\u2013400 lb of semtex inside an oil drum, partially hidden by rubble and wired to two 40-second fuses. The other five members of the unit followed in the van with Eugene Kelly driving, unit commander Patrick Kelly in the passenger seat, whilst in the rear were Lynagh, P\u00e1draig McKearney, and Seamus Donnelly. The digger crashed through the light security fence and the fuses were lit. The van stopped a short distance ahead and, according to the British security forces, three of the team jumped out and fired on the building with automatic weapons. Author Raymond Murray disputes this.  According to Taylor, and co-corroborated by an ECHR judgement, Patrick Kelly jumped from the passenger seat and, followed by others, immediately opened fire on the building, either to encourage the rest to resolve the dispute about going ahead with the attack, or possibly because this was the way previous attacks had begun. At the same time, the bomb detonated, the blast destroying the digger and badly damaging the building.\n\nWithin seconds the SAS opened fire on the IRA attackers from the station and from hidden positions outside with M16 and H&K G3 rifles and two L7A2 general-purpose machine guns. There were 600 spent British cartridge cases recovered from the scene, with approximately 125 bullet holes in the bodywork of the van, while 78 spent cartridge cases were recovered that were fired from IRA weapons. All eight IRA members were killed in the hail of gunfire; all had multiple wounds to their bodies, including their heads. Declan Arthurs was shot in a lane-way opposite Loughgall F.C. premises; he was unarmed and holding a cigarette lighter in his right hand. Three of the IRA members were shot at close range as they lay either dead or wounded on the ground. Three other IRA members in the scout cars escaped from the scene, managing to pass through British Army and RUC check-points set up after the ambush had been sprung. The two HMSU officers were injured in the explosion with one suffering severe head injuries and the other a broken nose and were helped outside by the uniformed officer with no officer returning fire. A SAS soldier received a facial injury from glass after a window was broken by gunfire.\n\nTwo civilians travelling in a car that happened to drive into the scene of the ambush while it was underway were also fired upon by the British forces. The two brothers, Anthony and Oliver Hughes, were driving home in a white Citroen GS Special car after repairing a lorry with Oliver wearing overalls similar to those being worn by the IRA unit. About 130 yards from the police station, British soldiers opened fire on their car from behind, killing Anthony (the driver) and badly wounding Oliver. The Citroen had approximately 34 bullet holes. The villagers had not been told of the operation and no attempt had been made to evacuate anyone or to seal off the ambush zone, as this might have alerted the IRA. A mother and her child took shelter in the church hall after their Ford Sierra's rear window was hit by a stray bullet 250 yards from the station.\n\nThe security forces recovered eight IRA firearms from the scene: three H&K G3 rifles, one FN FAL rifle, two FN FNC rifles, a Franchi SPAS-12T shotgun and a Ruger Security-Six revolver. The RUC linked the weapons to seven known murders and twelve attempted murders in the Mid-Ulster region. The Ruger had been stolen from Reserve RUC officer William Clement, killed two years earlier in the IRA attack on Ballygawley RUC base. It was found that another of the guns had been used in the murder of Harold Henry, a builder employed by the British Army and RUC in facilities construction in Northern Ireland.\n\n\n==Aftermath==\nShortly after the ambush the Provisional IRA released a statement saying: \"volunteers who shot their way out of the ambush and escaped saw other volunteers being shot on the ground after being captured\".\n\nThe IRA members killed in the ambush became known as the \"Loughgall Martyrs\" among IRA supporters. The men's relatives considered their deaths to be part of a deliberate shoot-to-kill policy by the security forces. Thousands of people attended their funerals, the biggest republican funerals in Northern Ireland since those of the IRA hunger strikers of 1981. Gerry Adams, in his graveside oration, gave a speech stating the British Government understood that it could buy off the government of the Republic of Ireland, which he described as the \"shoneen clan\" (that is, Anglophile), but added \"it does not understand the Jim Lynaghs, the P\u00e1draig McKearneys or the S\u00e9amus McElwaines. It thinks it can defeat them. It never will.\"\n\nThe East Tyrone Brigade continued to be active until the last Provisional IRA ceasefire ten years later. SAS operations against the IRA also continued. The IRA set out to find the informer it believed to be among them, although it has been suggested that the informer, if there ever was one, had been killed in the ambush.\n\nOn 20 March 1989, RUC Chief Superintendent Harry Breen was shot dead in an IRA ambush near the Irish border together with RUC Superintendent Bob Buchanan. Breen had given a media briefing on the day of the Loughgall ambush at the scene and the following morning displayed the recovered IRA firearms to the media appearing on television and in newspapers. An Irish Tribunal of Inquiry by Judge Peter Smithwick into the deaths of the two senior RUC officers investigating Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na collusion with the IRA, concluded in 2013 that Breen was the target of the ambush to abduct and interrogate him on how the British security services had advance warning of the Loughgall ambush.\n\nThe IRA attacked the Loughgall RUC station again around 1am on 5 September 1990 with a 1000 lb van bomb outside the station. The unmanned station suffered extensive damage with no one injured as a warning was given. Earlier in the week, the date of when the Loughgall ambush inquest was to start 24 September had been announced. In April 1996, the RUC confirmed that the Loughgall police station was to be re-built later that year. The station was in use until its administrative closure in August 2009. In April 2011, it was sold for private development.\n\n===Legal proceedings===\nIn September 1988, the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland concluded \"that the evidence did not warrant the prosecution of any person involved in the shootings\". Six families of the IRA members and the family of Anthony Hughes commenced civil proceedings against the Ministry of Defence (MoD). In April 1991, the widow of Anthony Hughes settled out of court. In May 1995, an inquest commenced that was held over four days which concluded that all nine men had died from serious and multiple gunshot wounds. Lawyers representing six families of IRA members withdrew from the inquest on the second day of hearings as the Coroner would not provide copies of witness statements to enable them to prepare. SAS soldiers did not give evidence with their statements read out.\n\nIn 2001, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that the eight IRA men and one civilian killed at Loughgall had their human rights violated by the failure of the British Government to conduct a proper investigation that was independent and transparent into their deaths. The applicants, the next-of-kin, claimed that the deaths were an unlawful killing. In December 2011, Northern Ireland's Historical Enquiries Team found that not only did the IRA team fire first but that they could not have been safely arrested. They concluded that the British Army was justified in opening fire.\n\nIn January 2014, the High Court ordered that the families of the IRA members suing the MoD could widen their claim to include the RUC Chief Constable. The police later disclosed documents for the court case revealing that IRA members had been under military surveillance for weeks prior to the ambush. In March 2014, the Hughes family received an apology from the MoD for the death of Anthony and for injuring Oliver that both men were \"wholly innocent of any wrongdoing\".\n\nIn September 2015, the Advocate General for Northern Ireland announced that a new inquest would be held. The inquest is estimated to take three to six months to hear.\n\n==Songs==\n\"Loughgall Ambush\" is the name of a republican ballad about the attack, recorded by Charlie and the Bhoys amongst others.\n\nThe event was also mentioned in the song \"Streets of Sorrow\/Birmingham Six\" by London Irish band The Pogues.\n\n==See also==\n*Timeline of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions\n*Attack on Ballygawley barracks\n*Ballygawley bus bombing\n*Attack on Derryard checkpoint\n*Clonoe ambush\n*1997 Coalisland attack\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n* Special Air Service (SAS) \u2013 Loughgall, Northern Ireland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe re-built Loughgall PSNI base in 2010, just before being sold to a development company|alt=.","urls":["https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/longwarirasinnfe00obri\/page\/141","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/longwarirasinnfe00obri\/page\/141","http:\/\/www.newsletter.co.uk\/news\/loughgall-how-the-sas-wiped-out-invincible-ira-unit-in-just-10-minutes-1-7678021","http:\/\/www.patfinucanecentre.org\/state-violence\/loughgall-search-truth","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-13287133","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/Northern_Ireland\/Story\/0,2763,801151,00.html","http:\/\/www.nuzhound.com\/articles\/arts2001\/pt-5-05-1.htm","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/m0008zcf","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/hopeagainsthisto00holl\/page\/143","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/hopeagainsthisto00holl\/page\/143","http:\/\/www.irishnews.com\/news\/2017\/05\/08\/news\/ira-man-tells-the-inside-story-of-the-loughgall-attack-and-the-sas-ambush-1019349\/","http:\/\/www.irishnews.com\/news\/2017\/05\/08\/news\/loughgall-bomb-was-transported-by-boat-1019351\/","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/northern_ireland\/1312421.stm","https:\/\/www.newsletter.co.uk\/news\/latest-news\/loughgall-how-compelling-intelligence-helped-foil-ira-gang-1-7678023","https:\/\/wwwjournals.lib.unb.ca\/Textsindex.php\/JCS\/CQ\/vol010_3summer1990\/wright.pdf","https:\/\/ptfs-oireachtas.s3.amazonaws.com\/DriveH\/AWData\/Library3\/smithwickFinal03122013_171046.pdf","https:\/\/www.irishtimes.com\/news\/crime-and-law\/link-to-loughgall-ambush-sealed-ruc-officer-s-fate-1.1616589","http:\/\/www.psni.police.uk\/property_sold.pdf","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20111217073954\/http:\/\/www.psni.police.uk\/property_sold.pdf","http:\/\/www.thefreelibrary.com\/PROVO+MASSACRE+PSNI+STATION+SOLD%3B+Scene+of+11+killings+set+to+be+used...-a0254788849","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/northern_ireland\/1311724.stm","http:\/\/www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk\/news\/local-national\/northern-ireland\/shot-ira-unit-fired-first-at-sas-28689002.html","https:\/\/www.irishtimes.com\/news\/crime-and-law\/courts\/permission-given-to-include-police-in-civil-action-over-sas-killings-1.1647484","https:\/\/www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk\/news\/northern-ireland\/ira-men-shot-dead-at-loughgall-had-been-under-surveillance-for-weeks-court-told-36897577.html","https:\/\/www.lurganmail.co.uk\/news\/government-apology-to-innocent-victims-of-sas-loughgall-ambush-1-6047991","https:\/\/www.thetimes.co.uk\/article\/dealing-with-the-past-looks-to-be-a-long-way-in-the-future-8mz90fpzp08","https:\/\/www.irishtimes.com\/news\/crime-and-law\/new-inquests-into-deaths-of-9-in-sas-ambush-at-loughgall-1.2363147","https:\/\/www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk\/news\/northern-ireland\/loughgall-inquest-could-take-up-to-six-months-to-complete-coroner-told-38511048.html","http:\/\/openlyrics.org\/charlie-and-the-bhoys\/lyric\/loughgall-ambush\/258267.html"]}
{"title":"Hipercor bombing","article":"The Hipercor massacre was a car bomb attack by the Basque separatist organisation ETA. It took place on 19 June 1987 at the Hipercor shopping centre on Avinguda Meridiana, Barcelona, Spain. The bombing killed 21 people and injured 45, the deadliest attack in ETA's history. Controversy surrounded the timing of telephone warnings made before the attack and the authorities' response to them.\n\n==Background==\nIn the two years before the attack, ETA detonated six car bombs in Barcelona that killed three people.\n\nUp to this point, Spain's deadliest terrorist attack had been the El Descanso bombing in Madrid by suspected Islamic militants which had killed 18\u00a0Spaniards and injured 82\u00a0others, including 11\u00a0American servicemen, who were believed to have been the target of the attack. The ETA attack which had caused the most fatalities had occurred on 14 July 1986 when a car bomb on Rep\u00fablica Dominicana Square in Madrid had killed 12\u00a0civil guards and injured 50\u00a0people.\n\nOn 10 June 1987, 10\u00a0days before the bombing, ETA's political wing Herri Batasuna had received its highest vote share in the European Parliament elections, becoming the most voted for party in the three Basque provinces.\n\n==Attack==\n===Preparations===\nActing on orders received from the ETA leader Santiago Arrospide Sarasola, \"Santi Potros\", three members of ETA's 'Barcelona Commando' Josefa Ernaga, Domingo Troiti\u00f1o and Rafael Caride Sim\u00f3n, decided to place an incendiary bomb inside a Hipercor store.\n\nThe three visited various commercial centres and selected one where a car could be parked. They then met in a flat in Calle Casteldefels, Barcelona and assembled a bomb containing 30 kilos of ammonal and 100 litres of gasoline together with a timer device and an indeterminate quantity of glue and flakes of soap to create a bomb weighing up to 200 kilograms. This was then placed in a stolen Ford Sierra.\n\n===Bombing===\nThe attack occurred on a Friday afternoon. The car bomb, hidden in the boot of the vehicle, had been placed on the first floor of the three-storey subterranean car park below the commercial centre.\n\nAt approximately 16:12, a timer activated the bomb which exploded destroying 20\u00a0vehicles parked nearby and causing a hole of around 5 metres in diameter in the ground floor of the shopping centre through which a huge ball of flame penetrated. Several of those unaffected by the flames were asphyxiated by the toxic gases produced causing several fatalities. The damage at the scene was so extensive that several of the corpses could not be located until two hours later and some had been burned so severely that identification was impossible. Initially 15 people were killed, of whom ten were women (one of whom was pregnant), three men and two children. However, the death toll then rose to 21, as six victims soccumbed to their injuries.\n\n==Telephone warnings==\nIn a subsequent communique ETA said they had given advance warning of the bomb but the police had failed to evacuate the area. The police said that the warning had come only a few minutes before the bomb exploded.\n\nThe Spanish news agency said a man claiming to speak for ETA had told the Barcelona newspaper Avui 30\u00a0minutes before the blast at 16:15 that a bomb would go off in the store. \n\nA spokesman at the store said police officers and private security guards began searching the store minutes before the blast. However the store management decided not to evacuate the store as it was not the first time that a bomb threat had been received. Ferran Cardenal, the Barcelona Civil Governor, said at a news conference that the police had searched the building before the bombing but found nothing.\n\nThree telephone warnings  had been received from a man who claimed to be an ETA spokesman with the first of the calls coming 57 minutes before the explosion. Some relatives said they would sue the police and the Hipercor store for failing to clear the crowded building after receiving the warnings. A store spokesman said it was up to the police to clear a building. But the Government spokesman said the decision was up to management. \"The building is private property. It's difficult to go against the will of the owners. The police's action was appropriate at all times.\"\n\n==Reactions==\nPrime Minister Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez, cut short a visit to Brazil to return to Spain. He told reporters in Salvador, Brazil: \"This attack is of a different style than what we have seen to date. It is an attempt to force the Government to change tack. But we will not give in to indiscriminate violence. We shall continue fighting terrorism with all the means we have.\"\n\nThere was almost universal condemnation of the attack. Some leaders of Batasuna also felt compelled to condemn the attack, although they pointed out that they did so in a personal capacity and not as party spokesmen.\n\nAn estimated 750,000\u00a0people marched through Barcelona with banners declaring, \"Catalonia Rejects Terrorism\". Around 700,000\u00a0workers paused for five minutes of silence to condemn the attack. While an ETA spokesman apologised for the attack, this apology was criticised, with the Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia asking: \"Does anyone who does not want to kill many people plant a bomb in a supermarket, at a peak hour on a Friday?\"\n\nFollowing the arrest in 1993 of the bomber Sim\u00f3n, The Independent noted that \"The attack was seen by many as a turning-point in the organisation's fortunes, its cold-blooded murder of women and children sickening many Basques who until then had sympathised with the group's aims.\"\n\n==Subsequent arrests and trial==\nOn 9 September 1987, Domingo Troiti\u00f1o and Josefa Ernaga were detained and on 23 October 1989 both were given sentences of 794\u00a0years in prison and fined more than 1,000\u00a0million pesetas. The Spanish Central Criminal Court ruled that they had acted in a premeditated manner and had spent a considerable time before the attack weighing up all the possible consequences. \n\nBoth were ordered to pay 320\u00a0million pesetas to the stores and to 114 people who had been injured in the attack. Additionally they were ordered to pay 525\u00a0million pesetas by way of civil responsibility to the families of those who had been killed and 200,650,000\u00a0pesetas to another 45\u00a0people who had been injured in the bombing. At the trial Troiti\u00f1o and Ernaga attempted to justify their actions, stating that they had only intended to incinerate the stores, not cause deaths, although they were aware there were inhabited buildings at the back of Hipercor.\n\nIn 1993, Rafael Caride Sim\u00f3n was arrested in France. Spanish police alleged that Caride Sim\u00f3n had been the former head of ETA's so-called \"Barcelona Commando\" and had planned the Hipercor attack. On 23 July 2003 he was sentenced to 790\u00a0years in prison for carrying out the attack, while at the same trial, Santi Potros received the same sentence for ordering the attack.\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-europe-48293187","http:\/\/hemeroteca.lavanguardia.es\/preview\/1987\/06\/20\/pagina-3\/32994937\/pdf.html","http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-dyn\/content\/article\/2009\/07\/30\/AR2009073001319.html","https:\/\/www.webcitation.org\/5ix0dBjUI?url=http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-dyn\/content\/article\/2009\/07\/30\/AR2009073001319.html","http:\/\/articles.latimes.com\/1987-06-19\/news\/mn-5025_1_bomb-threat","http:\/\/hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com\/preview\/1986\/07\/15\/pagina-4\/32884532\/pdf.html","http:\/\/www1.pre.gva.es\/pls\/argos_elec\/DMEDB_elecComunidades.informeElec?aNComuId=14&aVLengua=v","https:\/\/www.webcitation.org\/5ix0dij6p?url=http:\/\/www1.pre.gva.es\/pls\/argos_elec\/DMEDB_elecComunidades.informeElec?aNComuId=14&aVLengua=v","http:\/\/www1.pre.gva.es\/pls\/argos_elec\/DMEDB_ElecComunidades.informeElecDetallado?aNComuId=14&aNNumElec=1&aVTipoElec=E&aVFechaElec=1987&aVLengua=v","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20070821215030\/http:\/\/www.pre.gva.es\/pls\/argos_elec\/DMEDB_ElecComunidades.informeElecDetallado?aNComuId=14&aNNumElec=1&aVTipoElec=E&aVFechaElec=1987&aVLengua=v","http:\/\/www.abc.es\/20090619\/nacional-terrorismo\/cumplen-anos-atentado-hipercor-200906191018.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20090622175202\/http:\/\/www.abc.es\/20090619\/nacional-terrorismo\/cumplen-anos-atentado-hipercor-200906191018.html","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=l5tXm1V8lTIC&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&dq=hipercor+bomb+1987&source=bl&ots=qgF85AJz1Q&sig=0rBxr6H0B8zZQR-UEYm6DcdXMew&hl=en&ei=h3V4SpWJOdbD_gbU2_j_BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1987\/06\/23\/world\/spain-fears-bombing-may-herald-an-increase-in-terrorist-attacks.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1987\/06\/20\/world\/barcelona-bomb-kills-15-civilians.html","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/negotiatingwithe00clar","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/negotiatingwithe00clar\/page\/190","http:\/\/hemeroteca.lavanguardia.es\/preview\/1987\/06\/22\/pagina-6\/32996056\/pdf.html","http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/europe\/spain-hails-arrest-of-eta-chief-1474521.html","https:\/\/www.webcitation.org\/5ixVySB6f?url=http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/europe\/spain-hails-arrest-of-eta-chief-1474521.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1993\/03\/11\/world\/arrests-may-signal-end-of-basque-terrorism.html"]}

{"title":"Pan Am Flight 103","article":"Pan Am Flight 103 was a regularly scheduled Pan Am transatlantic flight from Frankfurt to Detroit via London and New York City. On 21 December 1988, N739PA, the aircraft operating the transatlantic leg of the route was destroyed by a bomb, killing all 243 passengers and 16 crew in what became known as the Lockerbie bombing. Large sections of the aircraft crashed onto a residential street in Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 11 people on the ground. With a total of 270 people killed, it is the deadliest terrorist attack in the history of the United Kingdom.\n\nFollowing a three-year joint investigation by Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), arrest warrants were issued for two Libyan nationals in November 1991. In 1999, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi handed over the two men for trial at Camp Zeist, Netherlands, after protracted negotiations and UN sanctions. In 2001, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, a Libyan intelligence officer, was jailed for life after being found guilty of 270 counts of murder in connection with the bombing. In August 2009, he was released by the Scottish Government on compassionate grounds after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. He died in May 2012 as the only person to be convicted for the attack.\n\nIn 2003, Gaddafi accepted responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing and paid compensation to the families of the victims, although he maintained that he had never given the order for the attack. Acceptance of responsibility was part of a series of requirements laid out by a UN resolution in order for sanctions against Libya to be lifted. Libya said it had to accept responsibility due to Megrahi's status as a government employee.\n\nDuring the Libyan Civil War in 2011, former Minister of Justice Mustafa Abdul Jalil claimed that the Libyan leader had personally ordered the bombing, though this was later denied, while investigators have long believed that Megrahi did not act alone, and have been reported as questioning retired Stasi agents about a possible role in the attack.\n\nSome relatives of the dead, including the Lockerbie campaigner Dr Jim Swire, believe the bomb was planted at Heathrow Airport and not sent via feeder flights from Malta, as the US and UK claim. A cell belonging to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (General Command) had been operating in West Germany in the months before the Pan Am bombing.\n\n==Aircraft==\n\n\n\nThe aircraft operating Pan Am Flight 103 was a Boeing 747\u2013121, registered  and named Clipper Maid of the Seas; prior to 1979, it had been named Clipper Morning Light. It was the 15th 747 built, and was delivered in February 1970, one month after the first 747 entered service with Pan Am. In 1978, as Clipper Morning Light, it had appeared in \"Conquering the Atlantic\", the fourth episode of the BBC Television documentary series Diamonds in the Sky, presented by Julian Pettifer.\n\n==Flight==\nPan Am 103 originated as a feeder flight at Frankfurt Airport, West Germany, using a Boeing 727. Both Pan Am and TWA routinely changed the type of aircraft operating different legs of a flight. PA103 was bookable as either a single Frankfurt-New York or a Frankfurt-Detroit itinerary, though a scheduled change of aircraft took place in London's Heathrow Airport. Upon arrival at Heathrow Terminal 3 on the day of the disaster, passengers and their luggage as well as an unaccompanied interline luggage on the feeder flight transferred directly onto Clipper Maid of the Seas, whose previous flight had originated from Los Angeles and arrived via San Francisco. The aircraft, which operated the flight's transatlantic leg, pushed back from the terminal at 18:04 and took off from runway 27R at 18:25, en route for New York JFK Airport and on to Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. Contrary to many popular accounts of the disaster (though repeated, with reference, below), the flight, which had a scheduled gate departure time of 18:00, left Heathrow airport on time.\n\nAfter the bombing, the flight number was changed, in accordance with standard practice among airlines after disasters. Within days, the Frankfurt-London-New York-Detroit route was being served by Pan Am Flight 3.\n\n==Explosion and collision timeline==\n\n===Contact is lost===\nAt 18:58, the aircraft established two-way radio contact with Shanwick Oceanic Area Control in Prestwick on 123.95\u00a0MHz.\n\nThe Clipper Maid of the Seas approached the corner of the Solway Firth at 19:01, and crossed the coast at 19:02 UTC. On scope, the aircraft showed transponder code, or \"squawk\", 0357 and flight level 310. At this point, the Clipper Maid of the Seas was flying at  on a heading of 316 degrees magnetic, and at a speed of  calibrated airspeed. Subsequent analysis of the radar returns by RSRE concluded that the aircraft was tracking 321\u00b0 (grid) and travelling at a ground speed of .\n\nAt 19:02:44, the clearance delivery officer at Shanwick transmitted its oceanic route clearance. The aircraft did not acknowledge this message. The Clipper Maid of the Seas \"squawk\" then flickered off. Air Traffic Control tried to make contact with the flight, with no response. At this time a loud sound was recorded on the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) at 19:02:50. Five radar echoes fanning out appeared, instead of one. Comparison of the cockpit voice recorder to the radar returns showed that, eight seconds after the explosion, the wreckage had a  spread. A British Airways pilot, flying the London\u2013Glasgow shuttle near Carlisle, called Scottish authorities to report that he could see a huge fire on the ground.\n\n===Disintegration of aircraft===\n\n\n\nThe explosion punched a 50-cm (20-inch) hole on the left side of the fuselage. Investigators from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) concluded that no emergency procedures had been started in the cockpit. The cockpit voice recorder, located in the tail section of the aircraft, was found in a field by police searchers within 24 hours. There was no evidence of a distress signal; a 180-millisecond hissing noise could be heard as the explosion destroyed the aircraft's communications centre. Although the explosion was in the aircraft hold, the effect was magnified by the large difference in pressure between the aircraft's interior and exterior, i.e., uncontrolled decompression of the fuselage. The aircraft's elevator and rudder control cables had been disrupted and the fuselage pitched downwards and to the left.\n\nInvestigators from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) of the British Department for Transport concluded that the nose of the aircraft was effectively blown off, and was separated from the main section within three seconds of the explosion. The nose cone was briefly held on by a band of metal but facing aft, like the lid of a can. It then sheared off, up and backwards to starboard, striking off the No. 3 engine and landing some distance outside the town, on a hill in Tundergarth.\n\n===Fuselage impact===\nThe fuselage continued moving forward and down until it reached , at which point its dive became nearly vertical. The rear fuselage, parts of the baggage hold and three landing gear units landed at Rosebank Crescent. The fuselage consisting of the main wing box structure landed in Sherwood Crescent, creating a large impact crater where three homes previously stood. The  of jet fuel ignited by the impact started fires which destroyed several additional houses. Investigators were able to determine that both wings had landed in the Sherwood Crescent crater, saying \"the total absence of debris from the wing primary structure found remote from the crater confirmed the initial impression that the complete wing box structure had been present at the main impact.\" The British Geological Survey  away at Eskdalemuir registered a seismic event at 19:03:36 measuring 1.6 on the moment magnitude scale, which was attributed to the impact. According to the report, the rest of the wreckage composed of \"the complete fuselage forward of approximately station 480 to station 380 and incorporating the flight deck and nose landing gear was found as one piece in a field approximately  east of Lockerbie.\" This field, located opposite Tundergarth Church, is where the wreckage most easily identified with images of the accident in the media fell, having fallen \"almost flat on its left side but with a slight nose-down attitude.\"\n\n==Victims==\n \n\n\nAll 243 passengers and 16 crew members were killed, as were 11 residents of Lockerbie on the ground. Of the 270 total fatalities, 190 were American citizens and 43 British citizens. Nineteen other nationalities were represented, with four or fewer passengers per country.\n\n===Crew===\nFlight 103 was under the command of Captain James B. MacQuarrie (55), an experienced pilot with almost 11,000 flight hours, of which more than 4,000 had been accrued in 747 aircraft. First Officer Raymond R. Wagner (52) had approximately 5,500 flight hours in the 747 and a total of almost 12,000 hours. Flight Engineer Jerry D. Avritt (46) had more than 8,000 hours of flying experience, with nearly 500 hours in the 747. He had come to Pan Am through the 1980 merger with National Airlines. The cockpit crew was based at JFK.\n\nSix of the 13 cabin crew members became naturalised US citizens while working for Pan Am. The cabin crew was based at Heathrow and lived in the London area or commuted from around Europe. All were originally hired by Pan Am and ranged from 28 years to nine months in seniority.\n\nThe captain, first officer, flight engineer, a flight attendant and several First Class passengers were found still strapped to their seats inside the nose section when it crashed in Tundergarth. The inquest heard that a flight attendant was found alive by a farmer's wife, but died before her discoverer could summon help. Some passengers may have remained alive briefly after impact; a pathologist's report concluded that at least two of these passengers might have survived if they had been found soon enough.\n\n===Passengers===\n\n====Syracuse University students====\nThirty-five of the passengers were students from Syracuse University returning home for Christmas following a semester studying in London at Syracuse's London campus.\n\n====Notable passengers====\n\nProminent among the passenger victims was the 50-year-old UN Commissioner for Namibia, Bernt Carlsson, who would have attended the signing ceremony of the New York Accords at the UN headquarters the following day. Also aboard were Volkswagen America CEO James Fuller who was returning from a meeting with Volkswagen executives in West Germany; musician Paul Jeffreys, the former bass player with Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel, with his wife on their honeymoon; and Irish Olympic sailor Peter Dix.\n\n====US government officials====\nMatthew Gannon, the Central Intelligence Agency's deputy station chief in Beirut, Lebanon, was sitting in Clipper Class, Pan Am's version of business class, seat 14J.\n\nThere was a party of US intelligence specialists on board the flight. Their presence gave rise to speculations and conspiracy theories, in which one or more of them were said to have been targeted.\n\n===Lockerbie residents===\nEleven Lockerbie residents on Sherwood Crescent were killed when the wing section hit the house at 13 Sherwood Crescent at more than  and exploded, creating a crater  long and with a volume of . The property was completely destroyed and its occupants were killed. Their bodies were never found. Several other houses and their foundations were destroyed, and 21 others were damaged so badly they had to be demolished.\n\nA family of four were killed when their house at 15 Sherwood Crescent exploded. A couple and their daughter were killed by the explosion in their house at 16 Sherwood Crescent. Their son witnessed a fireball engulfing his home from a neighbour's garage, where he had been repairing his sister's bicycle. The other Lockerbie residents who died were two widows aged 82 and 81, who also both lived in Sherwood Crescent; they were the two oldest victims of the disaster. The bodies of both 15 Sherwood Cresent children and both 16 Sherwood Crescent parents were never recovered.\n\nFather Patrick Keegans, Lockerbie's Roman Catholic priest, was preparing to visit the Henrys at approximately 7 pm that evening with his mother, having recently been appointed a parish priest of the town. Father Keegans' house at 1 Sherwood Crescent was the only one on the street that was neither destroyed by the impact nor gutted by fire. According to a BBC article on the fire published in 2018, Father Keegans had gone upstairs to make sure that he had hidden his mother's Christmas present, and recalls that \"Immediately after that, there was an enormous explosion\". The same source claims that, following this, \"the shaking stopped and to his surprise he was uninjured\". Mrs Keegans was also unharmed, having been shielded from debris by a fridge-freezer.\n\nDespite being advised by their governments not to travel to Lockerbie, many of the passengers' relatives, most of them from the US, arrived there within days to identify the dead. Volunteers from Lockerbie set up and staffed canteens, which stayed open 24 hours a day and offered relatives, soldiers, police officers, and social workers free sandwiches, hot meals, coffee, and someone to talk to. The people of the town washed, dried, and ironed every piece of clothing that was found once the police had determined they were of no forensic value, so that as many items as possible could be returned to the relatives. The BBC's Scotland correspondent, Andrew Cassell, reported on the 10th anniversary of the bombing that the townspeople had \"opened their homes and hearts\" to the relatives, bearing their own losses \"stoically and with enormous dignity\", and that the bonds forged then continue to this day.\n\n==Prior alerts==\nTwo alerts were released shortly before the bombing.\n\n===Helsinki warning===\nOn 5 December 1988 (16 days prior to the attack), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a security bulletin saying that, on that day, a man with an Arabic accent had telephoned the US Embassy in Helsinki, Finland and told them that a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt to the United States would be blown up within the next two weeks by someone associated with the Abu Nidal Organization; he said a Finnish woman would carry the bomb on board as an unwitting courier.\n\nThe anonymous warning was taken seriously by the US government and the State Department cabled the bulletin to dozens of embassies. The FAA sent it to all US carriers, including Pan Am, which had charged each of the passengers a $5 security surcharge, promising a \"program that will screen passengers, employees, airport facilities, baggage and aircraft with unrelenting thoroughness\"; the security team in Frankfurt found the warning under a pile of papers on a desk the day after the bombing. One of the Frankfurt security screeners, whose job was to spot explosive devices under X-ray, told ABC News that she had first learned what Semtex (a plastic explosive) was during her ABC interview 11 months after the bombing.\n\nOn 13 December, the warning was posted on bulletin boards in the US Embassy in Moscow and eventually distributed to the entire American community there, including journalists and businessmen.\n\n===PLO warning===\nJust days before the sabotage of the aircraft, security forces in European countries, including the UK, were put on alert after a warning from the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) that extremists might launch terrorist attacks to undermine the then ongoing dialogue between the United States and the PLO.\n\n==Claims of responsibility==\n\n\nThe day of the bombing, the French Directorate-General for External Security was informed by their British counterpart that the English suspected the Libyans to be behind the bombing.\n\nAccording to a CIA analysis dated 22 December 1988, several groups were quick to claim responsibility in telephone calls in the United States and Europe:\n\n* A male caller claimed that a group called the \"Guardians of the Islamic Revolution\" had destroyed the plane in retaliation for Iran Air Flight 655 being shot down by US forces in the Persian Gulf the previous July.\n* A caller claiming to represent the Islamic Jihad Organization told ABC News in New York that the group had planted the bomb to commemorate Christmas.\n*Another caller claimed responsibility for the \"Ulster Defence League\".\n*Another caller claimed the plane had been downed by Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service.\nThe list's author noted, \"We consider the claims from the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution as the most credible one received so far,\" but the analysis concluded, \"We cannot assign responsibility for this tragedy to any terrorist group at this time. We anticipate that, as often happens, many groups will seek to claim credit.\"\n\nMuammar Gaddafi took responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing and paid compensation to the victims' families in 2003, though he maintained that he had not ordered the attack. On 22 February 2011, during the Libyan Civil War, former Minister of Justice Mustafa Abdul Jalil stated in an interview with the Swedish newspaper Expressen that Muammar Gaddafi had personally ordered the bombing. Jalil claimed to possess \"documents that prove [his allegations] and [that he is] ready to hand them over to the international criminal court.\" Jalil later denied making this claim, saying he was misquoted.\n\nIn December 2013, it was revealed that the original prime suspects in the bombing had been the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine \u2013 General Command (PFLP-GC), a Syria-based group led by Ahmed Jibril. A flood of warnings immediately preceding the disaster had included one that read: 'team of Palestinians not associated with PLO intends to attack US targets in Europe. Time frame is present. Targets specified are Pan Am Airlines and US military bases.' Five weeks before this warning, Jibril's right-hand man, Haffez Dalkamoni, had been arrested in Frankfurt with a known bomb-maker, Marwen Khreesat. \"Later US intelligence officials confirmed that members of the group had been monitoring Pan Am's facilities at Frankfurt airport. On Dalkamoni's account bombs made by Khreesat were at large somewhere.\" A deep-cover CIA agent was told by up to 15 high-level Syrian officials that the PFLP-GC was involved and that officials interacted with Jibril \"on a constant basis\". In 2014, an Iranian ex-spy asserted that Iran ordered the attack. The Iranian foreign ministry swiftly denied any involvement.\n\n==Investigation==\n\n\n===Civil investigation===\n\n====Crash site====\n\n\nThe initial investigation into the crash site by Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary involved many helicopter surveys, satellite imaging, and a search of the area by police and soldiers. The wreckage of the crash was scattered over 2,000 square kilometres and AAIB investigators were confronted by a massive jigsaw puzzle in trying to piece the plane back together. In total, 4 million pieces of wreckage were collected and registered on computer files. More than 10,000 pieces of debris were retrieved, tagged and entered into a computer tracking system. The perpetrators had apparently intended the plane to crash into the sea, destroying any traceable evidence, but the late departure time (contrary to statement, with reference, above), of the aircraft meant that its explosion over land left a trail of evidence.\n\nThe fuselage of the aircraft was reconstructed by air accident investigators, revealing a  hole consistent with an explosion in the forward cargo hold. Examination of the baggage containers revealed that the container nearest the hole had blackening, pitting, and severe damage, indicating a \"high-energy event\" had taken place inside it. A series of test explosions were carried out to confirm the precise location and quantity of explosive used.\n\nFragments of a Samsonite suitcase believed to have contained the bomb were recovered, together with parts and pieces of circuit board identified as components of a Toshiba 'Bombeat' RT-SF16, radio cassette player, similar to that used to conceal a Semtex bomb seized by West German police from the Palestinian militant group Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine \u2013 General Command two months earlier. Items of baby clothing, which were subsequently proven to have been made in Malta, were thought to have come from the same suitcase.\n\n====Witnesses====\nThe clothes were traced to a Maltese merchant, Tony Gauci, who became a key prosecution witness, testifying that he sold the clothes to a man of Libyan appearance. Gauci was interviewed 23 times, giving contradictory evidence about who had bought the clothes, that person's age and appearance, and the date of purchase, but later identified Abdelbaset al-Megrahi. As Megrahi had only been in Malta on 7 December, that date was assumed to be the purchase date. This date is in doubt as Gauci had testified that Malta's Christmas lights had not been on when the clothes had been purchased; it was subsequently determined that the lights had been switched on on 6 December. Scottish police had also failed to inform the defence that another witness had testified seeing Libyan men making a similar purchase on a different day. An official report, providing information not made available to the defence during the original trial, stated that, on 19 April 1999, four days before identifying al-Megrahi for the first time, Gauci had seen a picture of al-Megrahi in a magazine which connected him to the bombing, a fact which could have distorted his judgement. Gauci was shown the same magazine during his testimony at al-Megrahi's trial and asked if he had identified the photograph in April 1999 as being the person who purchased the clothing; he was then asked if that person was in the court. Gauci then identified al-Megrahi for the court stating \u2013 \"He is the man on this side. He resembles him a lot\".\n\nA circuit board fragment, allegedly found embedded in a piece of charred material, was identified as part of an electronic timer similar to one found on a Libyan intelligence agent who had been arrested 10 months previously for carrying materials for a Semtex bomb. The timer was allegedly traced through its Swiss manufacturer, Mebo, to the Libyan military, and Mebo employee Ulrich Lumpert identified the fragment at al-Megrahi's trial. Mebo's owner, Edwin Bollier, testified at the trial that the Scottish police had originally shown him a fragment of a brown 8-ply circuit board from a prototype timer which had never been supplied to Libya. Yet the sample he was asked to identify at the trial was a green 9-ply circuit board that Mebo had indeed supplied to Libya. Bollier wanted to pursue this discrepancy, but was told by trial judge Lord Sutherland that he could not do so. Bollier claimed that in 1991 he had declined an offer of $4\u00a0million from the FBI in exchange for his support of the main line of inquiry, though this claim has never been verified.\n\n===Criminal inquiry===\nKnown as the Lockerbie bombing and the Lockerbie air disaster in the UK, it was described by Scotland's Lord Advocate as the UK's largest criminal inquiry led by the smallest police force in Britain, Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary.\n\nAfter a three-year joint investigation by Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, during which 15,000 witness statements were taken, indictments for murder were issued on 13 November 1991 against Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, a Libyan intelligence officer and the head of security for Libyan Arab Airlines (LAA), and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, the LAA station manager in Luqa Airport, Malta. UN sanctions against Libya and protracted negotiations with Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi secured the handover of the accused on 5 April 1999 to Scottish police at Camp Zeist, Netherlands, which was selected as a neutral venue for their trial.\n\nBoth the accused chose not to give evidence in court. On 31 January 2001, Megrahi was convicted of murder by a panel of three Scottish judges and sentenced to life imprisonment, but Fhimah was acquitted. Megrahi's appeal against his conviction was refused on 14 March 2002, and his application to the European Court of Human Rights was declared inadmissible in July 2003. On 23 September 2003, Megrahi applied to the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) for his conviction to be reviewed, and on 28 June 2007 the SCCRC announced its decision to refer the case to the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh after it found he \"may have suffered a miscarriage of justice\".\n\nMegrahi served just over 10 years of his sentence (beginning 5 April 1999), first in Barlinnie prison, Glasgow, and latterly in Greenock prison, Renfrewshire, throughout which time he maintained that he was innocent of the charges against him. He was released from prison on compassionate grounds on 20 August 2009.\n\nIn October 2015, Scottish prosecutors announced that they wanted to interview two Libyan nationals, whom they had identified as new suspects, over the bombing.\n\n==Trial, appeals, and release==\n\nOn 3 May 2000, the trial of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah began. Megrahi was found guilty of 270 counts of murder on 31 January 2001, and was sentenced to life imprisonment in Scotland; his co-defendant, Fhimah, was found not guilty.\n\nThe Lockerbie judgment stated: \"From the evidence which we have discussed so far, we are satisfied that it has been proved that the primary suitcase containing the explosive device was dispatched from Malta, passed through Frankfurt and was loaded onto PA103 at Heathrow. It is, as we have said, clear that, with one exception the clothing in the primary suitcase was the clothing purchased in Mr Gauci's shop on 7 December 1988. The purchaser was, on Mr Gauci's evidence, a Libyan. The trigger for the explosion was an MST-13 timer of the single solder mask variety. A substantial quantity of such timers had been supplied to Libya. We cannot say that it is impossible that the clothing might have been taken from Malta, united somewhere with a timer from some source other than Libya and introduced into the airline baggage system at Frankfurt or Heathrow. When, however, the evidence regarding the clothing, the purchaser and the timer is taken with the evidence that an unaccompanied bag was taken from KM180 to PA103A, the inference that that was the primary suitcase becomes, in our view, irresistible. As we have also said, the absence of an explanation as to how the suitcase was taken into the system at Luqa is a major difficulty for the Crown case, but after taking full account of that difficulty, we remain of the view that the primary suitcase began its journey at Luqa. The clear inference which we draw from this evidence is that the conception, planning and execution of the plot which led to the planting of the explosive device was of Libyan origin. While no doubt organisations such as the PFLP-GC and the PPSF were also engaged in terrorist activities during the same period, we are satisfied that there was no evidence from which we could infer that they were involved in this particular act of terrorism, and the evidence relating to their activities does not create a reasonable doubt in our minds about the Libyan origin of this crime.\"\n\n===Appeal===\nThe defence team had 14 days in which to appeal against Megrahi's conviction, and an additional six weeks to submit the full grounds of the appeal. These were considered by a judge sitting in private who decided to grant Megrahi leave to appeal. The only basis for an appeal under Scots law is that there has been a \"miscarriage of justice\", which is not defined in statute and so it is for the appeal court to determine the meaning of these words in each case. Because three judges and one alternate judge had presided over the trial, five judges were required to preside over the Court of Criminal Appeal: Lord Cullen, Lord Justice-General, Lord Kirkwood, Lord Osborne, Lord Macfadyen and Lord Nimmo Smith.\n\nIn what was described as a milestone in Scottish legal history, Lord Cullen granted the BBC permission in January 2002 to televise the appeal, and to broadcast it on the Internet in English with a simultaneous Arabic translation.\n\nWilliam Taylor QC, leading the defence, said at the appeal's opening on 23 January 2002 that the three trial judges sitting without a jury had failed to see the relevance of \"significant\" evidence and had accepted unreliable facts. He argued that the verdict was not one that a reasonable jury in an ordinary trial could have reached if it were given proper directions by the judge. The grounds of the appeal rested on two areas of evidence where the defence claimed the original court was mistaken: the evidence of Maltese shopkeeper, Tony Gauci, which the judges accepted as sufficient to prove that the \"primary suitcase\" started its journey in Malta; and, disputing the prosecution's case, fresh evidence would be adduced to show that the bomb's journey actually started at Heathrow. That evidence, which was not heard at the trial, showed that at some time in the two hours before 00:35 on 21 December 1988 a padlock had been forced on a secure door giving access air side in Terminal 3 of Heathrow airport, near to the area referred to at the trial as the \"baggage build-up area\". Taylor claimed that the PA 103 bomb could have been planted then.\n\nOn 14 March 2002, it took Lord Cullen less than three minutes to deliver the decision of the High Court of Judiciary. The five judges rejected the appeal, ruling unanimously that \"none of the grounds of appeal was well-founded\", adding \"this brings proceedings to an end\". The following day, a helicopter took Megrahi from Camp Zeist to continue his life sentence in Barlinnie Prison, Glasgow.\n\n===SCCRC review===\nMegrahi's lawyers applied to the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) on 23 September 2003 to have his case referred back to the Court of Criminal Appeal for a fresh appeal against conviction. The application to the SCCRC followed the publication of two reports in February 2001 and March 2002 by Hans K\u00f6chler, who had been an international observer at Camp Zeist, Netherlands appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. K\u00f6chler described the decisions of the trial and appeal courts as a \"spectacular miscarriage of justice\". K\u00f6chler also issued a series of statements in 2003, 2005, and 2007 calling for an independent international inquiry into the case and accusing the West of \"double standards in criminal justice\" in relation to the Lockerbie trial on the one hand and the HIV trial in Libya on the other.\n\nOn 28 June 2007, the SCCRC announced its decision to refer Megrahi's case to the High Court for a second appeal against conviction. The SCCRC's decision was based on facts set out in an 800-page report that determined that \"a miscarriage of justice may have occurred\". K\u00f6chler criticised the SCCRC for exonerating police, prosecutors and forensic staff from blame in respect of Megrahi's alleged wrongful conviction. He told The Herald of 29 June 2007: \"No officials to be blamed, simply a Maltese shopkeeper.\" K\u00f6chler also highlighted the role of intelligence services in the trial and stated that proper judicial proceedings could not be conducted under conditions in which extrajudicial forces are allowed to intervene.\n\n===Second appeal===\nA procedural hearing at the Appeal Court took place on 11 October 2007 when prosecution lawyers and Megrahi's defence counsel, Maggie Scott QC, discussed a number of legal issues with a panel of three judges. One of the issues concerned a number of documents that were shown before the trial to the prosecution, but were not disclosed to the defence. The documents are understood to relate to the Mebo MST-13 timer that allegedly detonated the PA103 bomb. Maggie Scott also asked for documents relating to an alleged payment of $2\u00a0million made to Maltese merchant, Tony Gauci, for his testimony at the trial, which led to the conviction of Megrahi.\n\nOn 15 October 2008, five Scottish judges decided unanimously to reject a submission by the Crown Office which sought to limit the scope of Megrahi's second appeal to the specific grounds of appeal that were identified by the SCCRC in June 2007. In January 2009, it was reported that, although Megrahi's second appeal against conviction was scheduled to begin in April 2009, the hearing could last as long as 12 months because of the complexity of the case and volume of material to be examined. The second appeal began on 28 April 2009, lasted for one month and was adjourned in May 2009. On 7 July 2009, the court reassembled for a procedural hearing and was told that because of the illness of one of the judges, Lord Wheatley, who was recovering from heart surgery, the final two substantive appeal sessions would run from 2 November to 11 December 2009, and 12 January to 26 February 2010. Megrahi's lawyer Maggie Scott expressed dismay at the delays: \"There is a very serious danger that my client will die before the case is determined.\"\n\n===Compassionate release and controversy===\n\nOn 25 July 2009, Megrahi applied to be released from jail on compassionate grounds. Three weeks later, on 12 August 2009, Megrahi applied to have his second appeal dropped and was granted compassionate release for his terminal prostate cancer. On 20 August 2009, Megrahi was released from prison and travelled by chartered jet to Libya.\nHis survival beyond the approximate \"three-month\" prognosis generated some controversy. It is believed that, following his release, Al-Megrahi was prescribed abiraterone and prednisone, a combination that extends median survival by an average of 14.8 months. After hospital treatment ended, he returned to his family home. Following his release, Megrahi published evidence on the Internet that was gathered for the abandoned second appeal which he claimed would clear his name.\n\nAllegations have been made that the UK government and BP sought Al-Megrahi's release as part of a trade deal with Libya. In 2008, the UK government \"decided to 'do all it could' to help the Libyans get Al-Megrahi home \u2026 and explained the legal procedure for compassionate release to the Libyans.\"\n\nMegrahi was released on licence and was therefore obliged to remain in regular contact with East Renfrewshire Council. On 26 August 2011, it was announced that the whereabouts of Al-Megrahi were unknown due to the social upheaval in Libya and that he had not been in contact for some time. It was reported on 29 August that he had been located and both the Scottish government and council issued a statement confirming that they had been in contact with his family and that his licence had not been breached. MP Andrew Mitchell said Al-Megrahi was comatose and near death. CNN reporter Nic Robertson said he was \"just a shell of the man he once was\" and was surviving on oxygen and an intravenous drip. In an interview on BBC Radio 5 Live, former US ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton called for Al-Megrahi to be extradited.\n\nTo me it will be a signal of how serious the rebel government is for good relations with the United States and the West if they hand over Megrahi for trial.\n\nMohammed al-Alagi, justice minister for the new leadership in Tripoli, said \"the council would not allow any Libyan to be deported to face trial in another country ... Abdelbaset al-Megrahi has already been judged once, and will not be judged again.\" Megrahi died of prostate cancer in Libya on 20 May 2012. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said that people should use the occasion to remember the Lockerbie victims.\n\n==Alleged motives==\n\n===Libya===\n\n\nUntil 2002, Libya had never formally admitted carrying out the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. On 16 April 2002, Libya formally admitted responsibility for Pan Am Flight 103 in a letter presented to the president of the United Nations Security Council. Felicity Barringer of The New York Times said that the letter had \"general language that lacked any expression of remorse\" for the people killed in the bombing. The letter stated that it \"accepted responsibility for the actions of its officials\".\n\nThe motive that is generally attributed to Libya can be traced back to a series of military confrontations with the US Navy that took place in the 1980s in the Gulf of Sidra, the whole of which Libya claimed as its territorial waters. First, there was the Gulf of Sidra incident (1981) when two Libyan fighter aircraft were shot down by two US Navy F-14 Tomcat fighters. Then, two Libyan radio ships were sunk in the Gulf of Sidra. Later, on 23 March 1986, a Libyan Navy patrol boat was sunk in the Gulf of Sidra, followed by the sinking of another Libyan vessel on 25 March 1986. The Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, was accused of retaliating for these sinkings by ordering the April 1986 bombing of La Belle, a West Berlin nightclub frequented by US military personnel, killing three people and injuring 230.\n\nThe US National Security Agency's (NSA) alleged interception of an incriminatory message from Libya to its embassy in East Berlin provided US President Ronald Reagan with the justification for Operation El Dorado Canyon on 15 April 1986, with US Navy and US Marine Corps warplanes launching from three aircraft carriers in the Gulf of Sidra and US Air Force warplanes launching from two British bases\u2014the first US military strikes from Britain since World War II\u2014against Tripoli and Benghazi in Libya. The Libyan government claimed the air strikes killed Hana Gaddafi, a daughter Gaddafi claimed he adopted (her reported age has varied between 15 months and seven years). To avenge his daughter's supposed death (Hana or Hanna's actual fate remains disputed), Gaddafi is said to have sponsored the September 1986 hijacking of Pan Am Flight 73 in Karachi, Pakistan.\n\nThe US in turn encouraged and aided the Chadian National Armed Forces (FANT) by supplying satellite intelligence during the Battle of Maaten al-Sarra. The attack resulted in a devastating defeat for Gaddafi's forces, following which he had to accede to a ceasefire ending the Chadian-Libyan conflict and his dreams of African dominance. Gaddafi blamed the defeat on French and US \"aggression against Libya\". The result was Gaddafi's lingering animosity against the two countries which led to Libyan support for the bombings of Pan Am Flight 103 and UTA Flight 772.\n\n===Demands for independent inquiry===\nPrior to the abandonment of Megrahi's second appeal against conviction and while new evidence could be still tested in court, there had been few calls for an independent inquiry into the Lockerbie bombing. Demands for such an inquiry emerged later, and became more insistent. On 2 September 2009, former MEP Michael McGowan demanded that the UK government call for an urgent, independent inquiry led by the UN to find out the truth about Pan Am flight 103. \"We owe it to the families of the victims of Lockerbie and the international community to identify those responsible,\" McGowan said. Two online petitions were started: one calling for a UK public inquiry into the Lockerbie bombing; the other a UN inquiry into the murder of UN Commissioner for Namibia, Bernt Carlsson, in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. In September 2009, a third petition which was addressed to the President of the United Nations General Assembly demanded that the UN should \"institute a full public inquiry\" into the Lockerbie disaster. On 3 October 2009, Malta was asked to table a UN resolution supporting the petition, which was signed by 20 people including the families of the Lockerbie victims, authors, journalists, professors, politicians and parliamentarians, as well as Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The signatories considered that a UN inquiry could help remove \"many of the deep misgivings which persist in lingering over this tragedy\" and could also eliminate Malta from this terrorist act. Malta was brought into the case because the prosecution argued that the two accused Libyans, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, had placed the bomb on an Air Malta aircraft before it was transferred at Frankfurt airport to a feeder flight destined for London's Heathrow airport, from which Pan Am Flight 103 departed. The Maltese government responded saying that the demand for a UN inquiry was \"an interesting development that would be deeply considered, although there were complex issues surrounding the event.\"\n\nOn 24 August 2009, Lockerbie campaigner Dr Jim Swire wrote to Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, calling for a full inquiry, including the question of suppression of the Heathrow evidence. This was backed up by a delegation of Lockerbie relatives, led by Pamela Dix, who went to 10 Downing Street on 24 October 2009 and handed over a letter addressed to Gordon Brown calling for a meeting with the Prime Minister to discuss the need for a public inquiry and the main issues that it should address. An op-ed article by Pamela Dix, subtitled \"The families of those killed in the bombing have not given up hope of an inquiry to help us learn the lessons of this tragedy\", was published in The Guardian on 26 October 2009. On 1 November 2009, it was reported that Gordon Brown had ruled out a public inquiry into Lockerbie, saying in response to Dr Swire's letter: \"I understand your desire to understand the events surrounding the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 but I do not think it would be appropriate for the UK government to open an inquiry of this sort.\" UK ministers explained that it was for the Scottish Government to decide if it wants to hold its own, more limited, inquiry into the worst terrorist attack on British soil. The Scottish Government had already rejected an independent inquiry, saying it lacks the constitutional power to examine the international dimensions of the case.\n\nConcluding his extensive reply dated 27 October 2009 to the Prime Minister, Dr Swire said: \"You have now received a much more comprehensive letter requesting a full inquiry from our group 'UK Families-Flight 103'. I am one of the signatories. I hope that the contents of this letter underline some of the reasons as to why I cannot possibly accept that any inquiry should be limited to Scotland, and I apologise if my previous personal letter of 24 August misled you over the main focus that the inquiry will need to address. That focus lies in London and at the door of the then inhabitant of Number 10 Downing Street. I look forward to hearing your comments both to our group's letter and to the contents of this one.\"\n\n===Claims of Gaddafi involvement===\n\nOn 23 February 2011, amidst the Libyan Civil War, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, former Libyan Justice Minister (and later member and Chairman of the anti-Gaddafi National Transitional Council), alleged that he had evidence that Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, had personally ordered Abdelbaset al-Megrahi to bomb Pan Am Flight 103.\n\n===Alternative theories===\n\nBased on a 1995 investigation by journalists Paul Foot and John Ashton, alternative explanations of the plot to commit the Lockerbie bombing were listed by The Guardian's Patrick Barkham in 1999. Following the Lockerbie verdict in 2001 and the appeal in 2002, attempts have been made to re-open the case amid allegations that Libya was framed. One theory suggests the bomb on the plane was detonated by radio. Another theory suggests the CIA prevented the suitcase containing the bomb from being searched. Iran's involvement is alleged, either in association with a Palestine militant group, or in loading the bomb while the plane was at Heathrow. The US Defense Intelligence Agency alleges that Ali Akbar Mohtashamipur (Ayatollah Mohtashemi), a member of the Iranian government, paid US$10\u00a0million for the bombing:\n\n\n\nOther theories implicate Libya and Abu Nidal, and apartheid South Africa.\n\n===PCAST statement===\nOn 29 September 1989, President Bush appointed Ann McLaughlin Korologos, former Secretary of Labor, to chair the President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism (PCAST) to review and report on aviation security policy in the light of the sabotage of flight PA103. Oliver \"Buck\" Revell, the FBI's Executive Assistant Director, was assigned to advise and assist PCAST in their task.\n\nBefore submitting their report, the PCAST members met a group of British PA103 relatives at the US embassy in London on 12 February 1990. One of the British relatives, Martin Cadman, alleges that a member of President Bush's staff told him: \"Your government and ours know exactly what happened but they are never going to tell.\" The statement first came to public attention in the 1994 documentary film The Maltese Double Cross \u2013 Lockerbie and was published in both The Guardian of 12 November 1994, and a special report from Private Eye magazine entitled Lockerbie, the flight from justice May\/June 2001.\n\n==Compensation==\n\n===From Libya===\nOn 29 May 2002, Libya offered up to US$2.7\u00a0billion to settle claims by the families of the 270 killed in the Lockerbie bombing, representing US$10\u00a0million per family. The Libyan offer was that 40% of the money would be released when United Nations sanctions, suspended in 1999, were cancelled; another 40% when US trade sanctions were lifted; and the final 20% when the US State Department removed Libya from its list of states sponsoring terrorism.\n\nJim Kreindler of the New York law firm Kreindler & Kreindler, which orchestrated the settlement, said: \"These are uncharted waters. It is the first time that any of the states designated as sponsors of terrorism have offered compensation to families of terror victims.\" The US State Department maintained that it was not directly involved. \"Some families want cash, others say it is blood money\", said a State Department official.\n\nCompensation for the families of the PA103 victims was among the steps set by the UN for lifting its sanctions against Libya. Other requirements included a formal denunciation of terrorism\u2014which Libya said it had already made\u2014and \"accepting responsibility for the actions of its officials\".\n\nOn 15 August 2003, Libya's UN ambassador, Ahmed Own, submitted a letter to the UN Security Council formally accepting \"responsibility for the actions of its officials\" in relation to the Lockerbie bombing. The Libyan government then proceeded to pay compensation to each family of US$8\u00a0million (from which legal fees of about US$2.5\u00a0million were deducted) and, as a result, the UN cancelled the sanctions that had been suspended four years earlier, and US trade sanctions were lifted. A further US$2\u00a0million would have gone to each family had the US State Department removed Libya from its list of states regarded as supporting international terrorism, but as this did not happen by the deadline set by Libya, the Libyan Central Bank withdrew the remaining US$540\u00a0million in April 2005 from the escrow account in Switzerland through which the earlier US$2.16\u00a0billion compensation for the victims' families had been paid. The United States announced resumption of full diplomatic relations with Libya after deciding to remove it from its list of countries that support terrorism on 15 May 2006.\n\nOn 24 February 2004, Libyan Prime Minister Shukri Ghanem stated in a BBC Radio 4 interview that his country had paid the compensation as the \"price for peace\" and to secure the lifting of sanctions. Asked if Libya did not accept guilt, he said, \"I agree with that.\" He also said there was no evidence to link Libya with the April 1984 shooting of police officer Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan Embassy in London. Gaddafi later retracted Ghanem's comments, under pressure from Washington and London.\n\nA civil action against Libya continued until 18 February 2005 on behalf of Pan Am and its insurers, which went bankrupt partly as a result of the attack. The airline was seeking $4.5\u00a0billion for the loss of the aircraft and the effect on the airline's business.\n\nIn the wake of the SCCRC's June 2007 decision, there have been suggestions that, if Megrahi's second appeal had been successful and his conviction had been overturned, Libya could have sought to recover the $2.16\u00a0billion compensation paid to the relatives. Interviewed by French newspaper Le Figaro on 7 December 2007, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi said that the seven Libyans convicted for the Pan Am Flight 103 and the UTA Flight 772 bombings \"are innocent\". When asked if Libya would therefore seek reimbursement of the compensation paid to the families of the victims (US$33\u00a0billion in total), Saif Gaddafi replied: \"I don't know\".\n\nFollowing discussions in London in May 2008, US and Libyan officials agreed to start negotiations to resolve all outstanding bilateral compensation claims, including those relating to UTA Flight 772, the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing and Pan Am Flight 103. On 14 August 2008, a US-Libya compensation deal was signed in Tripoli by US Assistant Secretary of State David Welch and Libya's Foreign Ministry head of America affairs, Ahmed al-Fatroui. The agreement covers 26 lawsuits filed by American citizens against Libya, and three by Libyan citizens in respect of the US bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986 which killed at least 40 people and injured 220. In October 2008 Libya paid $1.5\u00a0billion into a fund which will be used to compensate relatives of the\n\n# Lockerbie bombing victims with the remaining 20% of the sum agreed in 2003;\n# American victims of the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing;\n# American victims of the 1989 UTA Flight 772 bombing; and,\n# Libyan victims of the 1986 US bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi.\n\nAs a result, President Bush signed  restoring the Libyan government's immunity from terror-related lawsuits and dismissing all of the pending compensation cases in the US, the White House said. US State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, called the move a \"laudable milestone ... clearing the way for a continued and expanding US-Libyan partnership.\"\n\nIn an interview shown in BBC Two's The Conspiracy Files: Lockerbie on 31 August 2008, Saif Gaddafi said that Libya had admitted responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing simply to get trade sanctions removed. He went on to describe the families of the Lockerbie victims as very greedy: \"They were asking for more money and more money and more money\". Several of the victims families refused to accept compensation due to their belief that Libya was not responsible.\n\n====February 2011====\nIn an interview with Swedish newspaper Expressen on 23 February 2011, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, former Justice Secretary of Libya, claimed to have evidence that Gaddafi personally ordered Al-Megrahi to carry out the bombing.\n\nQuotes: \"[Jalil] told Expressen Khadafy [sic] gave the order to Abdel Baset al-Megrahi, the only man convicted in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground on 21 December 1988.\n'To hide it, he (Khadafy) did everything in his power to get al-Megrahi back from Scotland,' Abdel-Jalil was quoted as saying.\"\n\nAl Jalil's commentary to the Expressen came during widespread political unrest and protests in Libya calling for the removal of Ghaddafi from power. The protests were part of a massive wave of unprecedented uprisings across the Arab world in: Tunisia, Morocco, Bahrain and Egypt, where Egyptian protesters effectively forced the removal of long-term ruler, Hosni Mubarak, from office. Jalil's comments came on a day when Ghaddafi's defiance and refusal to leave his command prompted his brutal attacks on Libyan protesters.\n\nAbdel-Jalil stepped down as minister of justice in protest over the violence against anti-government demonstrations.\n\n====Contingency fees for lawyers====\nOn 5 December 2003, Jim Kreindler revealed that his Park Avenue law firm would receive an initial contingency fee of around US$1\u00a0million from each of the 128 American families Kreindler represents. The firm's fees could exceed US$300\u00a0million eventually. Kreindler argued that the fees were justified, since \"Over the past seven years we have had a dedicated team working tirelessly on this and we deserve the contingency fee we have worked so hard for, and I think we have provided the relatives with value for money.\"\n\nAnother top legal firm in the US, Speiser Krause, which represented 60 relatives, of whom half were UK families, concluded contingency deals securing them fees of between 28 and 35% of individual settlements. Frank Granito of Speiser Krause noted that \"the rewards in the US are more substantial than anywhere else in the world but nobody has questioned the fee whilst the work has been going on, it is only now as we approach a resolution when the criticism comes your way.\"\n\nIn March 2009, it was announced that US lobbying firm, Quinn Gillespie & Associates, received fees of $2\u00a0million for the work it did from 2006 through 2008 helping the PA103 relatives obtain payment by Libya of the final $2\u00a0million compensation (out of a total of $10\u00a0million) that was due to each family.\n\n===From Pan Am===\nIn 1992, a US federal court found Pan Am guilty of willful misconduct due to lax security screening caused by not implementing baggage reconciliation, a new security program mandated by the FAA prior to the incident, which requires unaccompanied luggage to be searched by hand and to ensure passengers board flights onto which they have checked baggage; Pan Am relied more on the less-effective method of x-ray screening. Two of Pan Am's subsidiaries, Alert Management Inc., which handles Pan Am's security at foreign airports, and Pan American World Services, were also found guilty.\n\n==Memorials and tributes==\n\n\nThere are several private and public memorials to the PA103 victims. Dark Elegy is the work of sculptor Suse Lowenstein of Long Island, whose son Alexander, then 21, was a passenger on the flight. The work consists of 43 nude statues of the wives and mothers who lost a husband or a child. Inside each sculpture there is a personal memento of the victim.\n\n===United States===\n\n\nOn 3 November 1995, then-US President Bill Clinton dedicated a Memorial Cairn to the victims at Arlington National Cemetery, and there are similar memorials at Syracuse University; Dryfesdale Cemetery, near Lockerbie; and in Sherwood Crescent, Lockerbie.\n\nSyracuse University holds a memorial week every year called \"Remembrance Week\" to commemorate its 35 lost students. Every 21 December, a service is held in the university's chapel at 14:03 (19:03 UTC), marking the moment the bomb on board the aircraft was detonated. The university also awards university tuition fees to two students from Lockerbie Academy each year, in the form of its Lockerbie scholarship. In addition, the university annually awards 35 scholarships to seniors to honour each of the 35 students killed. The \"Remembrance Scholarships\" are among the highest honors a Syracuse undergraduate can receive. SUNY Oswego also gives out scholarships in memorial of Colleen Brunner to a student who is studying abroad.\n\n==== The Women of Lockerbie ====\nThe Women of Lockerbie (2003) is a play written by Deborah Brevoort which depicts a woman from New Jersey roaming the hills of Lockerbie, Scotland.  This mother tragically lost her son in the bombing of the Pan Am Flight 103.  While in Lockerbie, 7 years after the flight, she meets the women who witnessed and were affected by the crash itself while she attempts to find closure. This play has received the Silver Medal from the Onassis International Playwriting Competition and the Kennedy Center Fund for New American Plays award.\n\n===Lockerbie===\n\n\nThe main UK memorial is at Dryfesdale Cemetery about a mile west of Lockerbie. There is a semicircular stone wall in the garden of remembrance with the names and nationalities of all the victims along with individual funeral stones and memorials. Inside the chapel at Dryfesdale there is a book of remembrance. There are memorials in Lockerbie and Moffat Roman Catholic churches, where plaques list the names of all 270 victims. In Lockerbie Town Hall Council Chambers, there is a stained-glass window depicting flags of the 21 different countries whose citizens lost their lives in the disaster. There is also a book of remembrance at Lockerbie public library and another at Tundergarth Church. In Sherwood Crescent there is a garden of remembrance to the seven Lockerbie residents killed when the aircraft's main wreckage fell there, destroying their homes.\n\n==Wreckage of the aircraft==\nThe Air Accidents Investigation Branch reassembled a large part of the fuselage to aid with the investigation; this has been retained as evidence and stored in a hangar at Farnborough Airport since the bombing. It was announced in April 2013 that this part of the aircraft was transferred to a secure location in Dumfries, and that it remains evidence in the ongoing criminal investigation.\n\nThe remaining wreckage of the aircraft is stored about a mile from Tattershall, Lincolnshire, at Roger Windley's scrapyard, pending the conclusion of the American victims' civil case and further legal proceedings. The remains include the nose section of the Boeing 747, which was cut into several pieces to assist in removal from Tundergarth Hill.\n\n==See also==\n\n* Air India Flight 182\u2014Another terrorist bombing over the Atlantic Ocean en route to London over Irish airspace\n* The Boy Who Fell Out of the Sky, Ken Dornstein's book about his brother who died in the crash\n* Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 1103, allegedly shot down by Muammar Gaddafi to show the negative effects of sanctions imposed on Libya after the bombing of Flight 103\n* List of accidents and incidents involving commercial aircraft\n* The Maltese Double Cross \u2013 Lockerbie a documentary film\n* Timeline of airliner bombing attacks\n\n\n==References==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n*  The Scottish indictment against Megrahi and Fhimah, 13 November 1991.

{"title":"DAS Building bombing","article":"The DAS Building bombing was a truck bomb attack in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, at 7:30 am on December 6, 1989, targeting the Administrative Department of Security (DAS) headquarters.\n\nA truck parked near the building exploded, killing 63 people and injuring about 1,000. The bomb blast, an estimated 500\u00a0kg of dynamite, leveled several city blocks and destroyed more than 300 commercial properties.\nIt is widely believed that the Medell\u00edn Cartel was responsible for the attack, in an attempt to assassinate DAS director Miguel Maza M\u00e1rquez, who escaped unharmed. The same group was believed to be behind the bombing of Avianca Flight 203 the previous month.\n\nThe DAS building bombing was the last in the long series of attacks that targeted Colombian politicians, officials, and journalists in 1989, which started with the January 18 killing of 12 judicial officials in Simacota.\n\n==References==\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffects of the bomb.","urls":["https:\/\/www.eltiempo.com\/archivo\/documento\/MAM-187246","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1989\/12\/08\/world\/colombia-cartels-tied-to-bombing.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1994\/12\/20\/nyregion\/drug-trafficker-convicted-of-blowing-up-jetliner.html<\/ref>","https:\/\/www.apnews.com\/e6ed187c3137830e026c3e843677587a<\/ref>","http:\/\/www.elespectador.com\/noticias\/nacional\/1989-ano-tener-memoria-articulo-469466"]}
{"title":"Sabadell bombing","article":"The Sabadell bombing was a car bombing carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA in Sabadell, Catalonia, Spain on 8 December 1990.\n\nThe target was a convoy carrying eight members of the National Police force on the way to police a football game between Sabadell and M\u00e1laga CF. Six of the police officers were killed, with the other two injured. Eight civilians were also injured in the attack, which was ETA's deadliest of 1990.\n\n==Background==\nIn the early 1990s, ETA had stepped up its attacks in Catalonia in an attempt to gain worldwide publicity and secure political concessions by threatening disruption to the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Police had obtained documents revealing these plans in the week before the attack.\n\nTwo weeks earlier, on 23 November, ETA had attacked the Guardia Civil barracks in Sant Carles de la R\u00e0pita in Catalonia, though no one had been injured.\n\n==Attack==\nAt approximately 1345 on the day of the attack, ETA placed the car bomb on the junction of Josep Aparici and Ribot i Serra streets, where vehicles would normally have to slow down to pass. The car bomb, located some 500 metres from the main police station, was detonated remotely from the nearby Gran Via, the main thoroughfare in the town, from which there was easy access to the A7 motorway, allowing the perpetrators to escape. The bomb caused a large explosion, mostly destroying the second of the two vehicles of the police convoy and caused extensive damage to nearby buildings, with shrapnel found up to 400 metres away. Five of the eight police officers in that vehicle were killed instantly, with a sixth dying shortly afterwards. The other two policemen were seriously injured. A further eight passersby also sustained injuries in the attack.\n\n==Bombers==\nPolice sources attributed the attack to ETA's Barcelona Commando Unit. They immediately identified Joan Carles Monteagudo and Juan F\u00e9lix Erezuma, the two suspected leaders of the cell, as participants in the attack. On 30 May 1991, the day after a bomb attack in Vic had killed nine people, Monteagudo and Erezuma were killed in a gunfight with police in Lli\u00e7\u00e0 d'Amunt, near Barcelona.\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/elpais.com\/diario\/2005\/12\/09\/catalunya\/1134094046_850215.html","http:\/\/www.elpais.com\/especial\/eta\/victimas.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20120512035345\/http:\/\/www.elpais.com\/especial\/eta\/victimas.html","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=vj5-Srq3ki4C&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=eta+barcelona+olympics&source=bl&ots=6PEUfxUrE3&sig=Rn9K2mhZ1BWJqoz6xXBOR2rzSSU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NPMyUdWeIMKF4gSv5YHIDw&ved=0CGEQ6AEwCQ","http:\/\/elpais.com\/diario\/1990\/12\/09\/espana\/660697212_850215.html","http:\/\/hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com\/preview\/1990\/11\/24\/pagina-1\/33459564\/pdf.html","http:\/\/hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com\/preview\/1990\/12\/09\/pagina-15\/33466996\/pdf.html","http:\/\/elpais.com\/diario\/1991\/05\/31\/espana\/675640823_850215.html"]}

{"title":"Bombings of Paddington and Victoria stations","article":"On 18 February 1991 the Provisional IRA (PIRA) exploded two bombs at London mainline stations, one at Victoria station and the other at Paddington station, killing one person and injuring 38 other people all at Victoria station. It was the IRA's second major attack in London in February 1991 after the Downing Street mortar attack eleven days earlier which was an attempt to wipe out the British War cabinet and the British prime minister John Major. It was also the first IRA attack against a civilian target in England since the 1983 Harrods bombing, marking a strategic change in their bombing campaign in England.\n\n==Background==\nThe IRA had stepped up their campaign against British military, economic and transport targets outside of Northern Ireland in the late 1980s. In May 1988 they killed three members of the RAF in attacks in the Netherlands. On 13 July 1988, nine British soldiers were injured when the IRA detonated two bombs at a British military barracks in Duisburg, West Germany. On 1 August 1988 the first Provisional IRA bomb on the UK mainland in four years was set off by a timer device at the British Army base at the Inglis Barracks in Mill Hill, North London. The two storey building containing the single men's quarters was completely destroyed. One soldier, Lance Corporal Michael Robbins, was killed, and nine others were injured. In September 1989 eleven Royal Marines were killed and 22 others injured when the IRA bombed their barracks in Deal, Kent, England. On 18 November 1989 two British soldiers were wounded when an IRA car bomb exploded at a British Army barracks in Colchester, England. On 20 February 1990 the IRA bombed a British military recruitment office in Leicester, England, where two people were injured in the attack. Five days later on 25 February 1990, another recruitment office was bombed, this time in Halifax, West Yorkshire. Less than three weeks before the Lichfield attack on 16 May 1990 the IRA detonated another bomb under a military minibus in London, killing Sergeant Charles Chapman, and injuring four other soldiers. After this attack the IRA released a statement which read \"While the British government persists in its continued occupation of the north of Ireland the IRA will persist in attacking the British government and its forces in England.\" On 30 July 1990 the IRA detonated a large bomb at the London Stock Exchange causing massive damage but no injuries. Ten days later they killed Conservative MP Ian Gow.\n\n===Previous republican bombings===\nOn 26 February 1884, at Victoria station, an explosion occurred in the cloakroom of the Brighton side injuring seven staff members, as part of the Fenian dynamite campaign.\n\nOn 8 September 1973, a Provisional IRA bomb exploded at the ticket office in Victoria station, injuring five people. This was part of the IRA's 1973 - 1976 England bombing campaign.\n\n==The bombings==\nThe Paddington bomb went off at 4:20am, it was much smaller than the second bomb at Victoria and was designed to make sure the security services would take the Victoria bomb seriously and not as a hoax. There were no deaths or injuries at Paddington but the roof was badly damaged.\n\nSome time before 7:00 am, a caller with an Irish accent said: \"We are the Irish Republican Army. Bombs to go off in all mainline stations in 45 minutes.\" The Victoria station bomb, which was hidden in a rubbish bin inside the station, went off at 7:40 am. Despite a 45-minute warning and the Paddington bomb three hours before, the security services were slow to act. The bomb killed one person instantly and injured 38 others from flying glass and other debris. This was the worst attack suffered by civilians in England by the IRA since the 1983 Harrods bombing which killed three policemen, three civilians and injured 50 people. All London's rail terminals were closed, disrupting the journeys of almost half a million commuters and bringing chaos to London, which was the IRA's intended goal. There was also a hoax call made to Heathrow, causing the airport's closure.\n\nThat night the Provisional IRA claimed responsibility for the bombings but blamed the British police for the casualties. A statement from the Provisional IRA GHQ said: \"The cynical decision of senior security personnel not to evacuate railway stations named in secondary warnings, even three hours after the warning device had exploded at Paddington in the early hours of this morning was directly responsible for the casualties at Victoria.\" The statement went on, \"All future warnings should be acted upon.\" The main purpose of the bombings in the overall IRA strategy was to keep pressure up on John Major, his Government and to make sure he acted on the Irish Troubles.\n\nPolice defended the decision not to close all stations after receiving warning that bombs had been planted. Commander George Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad, said that dozens of hoax calls were received every day. \"It is very easy with hindsight to be critical.\"  Churchill-Coleman also said that the bomb was \"quite deliberately intended to maim and kill.\"\n\nA year later, a French TV crew interviewed an IRA Commander who said he spoke on behalf of the IRA's GHQ Staff, several other IRA volunteers were interviewed as part of an Active Service Unit (ASU) (armed with AR-15's, heavy machine guns, a revolver and an RPG-7). The commander of the unit said about the Victoria station bombing that warnings were given by telephone naming nine railway stations in London and that a 50-minute warning was given. He went on to say that the attack was not aimed at hurting anybody but to disrupt the British transport system.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Home Secretary, Kenneth Baker, visited Victoria station after the bomb and said \"The concourse of Victoria is covered in blood. This is the act of murderous criminals.\" The Queen, and other officials, also sent their condolences to the victims.\n\nThis bombing would mark the IRA's shift to targeting civilian areas following the July 1990 London Stock Exchange bombing - something they had not done since the 1983 Harrods bombing. It was also the first IRA attack on the London transport system since 1976. The IRA kept bombing targets in England for the remainder of the year - dozens of bombs went off in the run up to Christmas 1991. A number of incendiary devices ignited at The Discount Furniture Store, Habitat, The World of Leather, The Reject Shop and Tottenham Court Road causing damage to property but no injuries on 1 December 1991. An incendiary device ignited at Littlewoods, Oxford Street, London W1 on 2 December. There were further attacks throughout the month but no injuries.\n\nAlmost a year later, in February 1992 a bomb exploded at London Bridge station, injuring 30 people. In April 1992 a large bomb went off at the bombing of the Baltic Exchange, killing three people and causing \u00a3800 million worth of damage, \u00a3200 million more than the total damaged caused by the 10,000 explosions that had occurred during the Troubles in Northern Ireland up to that point. A bomb went off in Manchester city centre in December 1992, injuring over 60 people.\n\n==See also==\n*Bombings of King's Cross and Euston stations\n*Cannon Street train bombing\n*Parsons Green bombing \n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/cgi-bin\/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&day=18&month=02&year=1991","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/othelem\/chron\/ch91.htm","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1991\/02\/19\/world\/2-rail-terminals-in-central-london-hit-by-ira-bombs.html<\/ref>","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/cgi-bin\/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&day=1&month=05&year=1988","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/othelem\/chron\/ch88.htm","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/cgi-bin\/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&day=22&month=09&year=1989","http:\/\/www.apnewsarchive.com\/1990\/Minister-Says-London-Being-Subjected-To-IRA-Terror-Campaign\/id-110fb3fa2bbe481e9f2adc0b8f0fe516","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/othelem\/chron\/ch90.htm","https:\/\/www.memorialatpeninsula.org\/?p=13737","https:\/\/www.upi.com\/Archives\/1991\/02\/18\/One-killed-40-wounded-in-suspected-IRA-attack\/9583666853200\/<\/ref>","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/uk\/1991\/feb\/19\/northernireland.duncancampbell","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/cgi-bin\/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&day=17&month=12&year=1983","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/uk\/1991\/feb\/19\/northernireland.duncancampbell<\/ref>","http:\/\/journaltimes.com\/news\/national\/ira-bombs-kill-one-disrupt-london\/article_220286f8-0220-5cfe-bd90-8ea74884fbf1.html<\/ref>","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1991\/02\/19\/world\/2-rail-terminals-in-central-london-hit-by-ira-bombs.html","https:\/\/www.deseretnews.com\/article\/147693\/BLAST-AT-LONDONS-VICTORIA-STATION-KILLS-1-INJURES-37.html<\/ref>","https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oXIJRtlNiPs","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/othelem\/chron\/ch91.htm","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/othelem\/chron\/ch92.htm","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/othelem\/chron\/ch92.htm","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/othelem\/chron\/ch92.htm"]}
{"title":"Via D'Amelio bombing","article":"The via D'Amelio bombing was a terror attack by the Sicilian Mafia which took place in Palermo, Sicily, Italy on 19 July 1992. It killed anti-mafia magistrate Paolo Borsellino and five members of his police escort: Agostino Catalano, Emanuela Loi (the first Italian female member of a police escort and the first to be killed on duty), Vincenzo Li Muli, Walter Eddie Cosina and Claudio Traina.\n\nThe so-called agenda rossa, the red notebook in which Borsellino used to write down details of his investigations and which he always carried with him, disappeared from the site in the moments after the explosion. A carabinieri officer who was present when the explosion occurred reported he had delivered the notebook to Giuseppe Ayala, the first Palermo magistrate to arrive at the scene. Ayala, who said he had refused to receive it, was later criticized for saying escorts to anti-mafia judges should be reduced, despite evidence of further failed attempts to kill them in subsequent years.\n\n==Bombing==\nThe bombing occurred at 4:58\u00a0p.m. on 19 July 1992, 57 days after the Capaci bombing, in which Borsellino's friend, anti-mafia magistrate Giovanni Falcone, had been killed with his wife and police escort. The only survivor of the escort in the bombing, Antonino Vullo, said the judge had stayed in his summer residence outside Palermo from 1:30\u00a0p.m. to around 4:00\u00a0p.m., when he and the escort drove to Via D'Amelio in the Sicilian capital, where he was to meet his mother. When they arrived, Vullo and the other agents noticed nothing unusual except some parked cars. The car in which Borsellino had been travelling exploded, along with one of the escort cars, while Vullo was sitting in a third car.\n\nThe bomb, containing some  of TNT, had been placed in a Fiat 126. Normal procedure when Borsellino travelled was to clear the road of cars before his arrival, but this was not allowed by the administration of the comune of Palermo, as reported by another anti-mafia judge, Antonino Caponnetto. Gaspare Spatuzza, a mafioso who later became a pentito, eventually revealed he had stolen the Fiat 126 on the orders of the Graviano and Brancaccio mafia clans.\n\nThe bloodbath provoked outrage. The night after, protesters peacefully besieged the prefecture of Palermo. Borsellino's funeral saw vehement protests by the crowd against the participants; the national police chief, Arturo Parisi, was struck while trying to escape. A few days later, questore (local police commander) Vito Plantone and prefetto Mario Jovine were transferred. The chief prosecutor of Palermo, Pietro Giammanco, resigned. Meanwhile, 7,000 soldiers were sent to Sicily to patrol roads and possible locations for attacks.\n\n==Aftermath==\nBorsellino used to carry a red notebook, the so-called agenda rossa, in which he wrote down details of his investigations before making an official record in judicial reports. His colleagues were not given access to the agenda rossa.\n\nCarabinieri officer Rosario Farinella said later that, after recovering the agenda rossa from the car, he gave it to Ayala. Ayala said he was staying in a hotel nearby and rushed to the place after hearing the explosion. He initially stumbled on the corpse of Borsellino without recognizing it, as the dead judge was limbless. Ayala said \"an officer in uniform\" had offered him the notebook, but that he had refused it because he lacked authority. Carabinieri captain Arcangioli said he was not wearing uniform at the scene. In September 2005, Ayala changed his version, saying he took the agenda rossa while exploring the destroyed car and later gave it to a carabinieri officer who was there. Ayala's subsequent statements speak of an agent alternately in uniform and not in uniform.\n\nOn 1 July 1992 Borsellino had held a meeting with Nicola Mancino, who at the time had just been appointed Minister of the Interior. Details of the meeting have never been disclosed, but it is likely that Borsellino had annotated them in his agenda. Mancino, however, always denied having met Borsellino. In a television interview of 24 July 2009, Ayala said, \n\"Mancino himself told me that he had met Borsellino on 1 July 1992. Moreover, Mancino showed me his appointments book, with the name of Borsellino on it.\" Ayala repudiated this account in an interview in Sette magazine. A video showing Arcangioli holding the agenda rossa while inspecting the bombing area was aired in news on Italian state channel Rai 1 in 2006.\n\nA personal diary in the possession of Borsellino's family has an annotation by the judge that reads: \"1 July h 19:30 : Mancino\". Vittorio Aliqu\u00f2, another magistrate, later said he had accompanied Borsellino \"up to the threshold of the minister's office\".\n\n\n\n==Investigations and sentences==\nIn July 2007 the prosecutor's office in Caltanissetta opened an investigation into the possible involvement of agents from SISDE, Italy's civil intelligence service, in the massacre. At the same time, a letter from Borsellino's brother Salvatore was published. Entitled 19 luglio 1992: Una strage di stato (\"19 July 1992: A state massacre\"), the letter supports the hypothesis that Minister of the Interior Mancino knew the reasons for the magistrate's assassination. Salvatore Borsellino wrote:\n\n\nInvestigations held by police telecommunications expert Gioacchino Genchi attested the presence of an undercover SISDE installation in Castello Utveggio, an art nouveau castle on Monte Pellegrino, a mountain overlooking Palermo and Via D'Amelio. This was discovered by analyzing the phone calls of mafia boss Gaetano Scotto, who called a SISDE phone in the castle. Scotto's brother Pietro had done maintenance work on phone lines in Via D'Amelio; it was later discovered that Pietro had tapped Borsellino's mother's phone to obtain confirmation of Borsellino's arrival before the massacre. All trace of SISDE disappeared from Castello Utveggio immediately after the assassination. Mafia boss Tot\u00f2 Riina spoke about the presence of the Italian intelligence service on Monte Pellegrino on 22 May 2004, in the trial relating to the Via dei Georgofili bombing. In an interview on the Italian state TV documentary show La storia siamo noi (History is Us), Borsellino's widow said he, in the days before the massacre, had her close the shutters on the windows because \"they can observe us from Castello Utveggio\".\n\nThe first investigations led to the arrest of Vincenzo Scarantino on 26 September 1992, accused by pentiti of having stolen the car used in the explosion. (Scarantino later became a pentito himself.) The magistrates also discovered the phone of Borsellino's mother had been tapped. A first trial for the massacre ended on 26 January 1996, with Scarantino sentenced to 18 years in prison, while Giuseppe Orofino, Salvatore Profeta and Pietro Scotto, those who prepared the bomb and intercepted the phone, were sentenced to life imprisonment. Scotto and Orofino, however, were acquitted on appeal. A second trial was started in 1999 after Scarantino changed his statements; this time, Salvatore Riina, Pietro Aglieri, Salvatore Biondino, Carlo Greco, Giuseppe Graviano, Gaetano Scotto and Francesco Tagliavia were sentenced to life imprisonment. A third trial in 2002 involved 26 other mafia bosses who had been involved in the massacre in various ways, ending with life sentences for Bernardo Provenzano, Pippo Cal\u00f2, Michelangelo La Barbera, Raffaele Ganci, Domenico Ganci, Francesco Madonia, Giuseppe Montalto, Filippo Graviano, Cristoforo Cannella, Salvatore Biondo and another Salvatore Biondo.\n\nIn 1992 the Italian political world was shaken by the Mani Pulite (clean hands) corruption scandal, after which most of the parties that had been the traditional political supporters of the mafia would disappear. In 2009 Massimo Ciancimino, son of the mafioso former mayor of Palermo Vito Ciancimino, said the Italian establishment and the mafia had been negotiating a pact in those days. Among other things, the agreement would involve the creation of a new party, Forza Italia, with the help of founder Silvio Berlusconi's chief collaborator, Marcello Dell'Utri, who was later convicted of allegiance to the mafia.\n\nAfter the new revelations, Sicilian attorneys started new investigations based on the hypothesis that Borsellino knew of the negotiations between the mafia, SISDE and senior politicians, and that he was assassinated because of this knowledge. The existence of negotiations between Italian institutions and the Sicilian mafia was confirmed in 2012 by Caltanissetta prosecutor Nico Gozzo as \"by now an established fact\".\n\n==References==\n\n\n==Sources==\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nA memorial in Via D'Amelio.","urls":["https:\/\/www.corriere.it\/International\/english\/articoli\/2012\/03\/08\/borsellino.shtml","http:\/\/www.corriere.it\/speciali\/stragedamelio\/","http:\/\/www.ilfattoquotidiano.it\/2010\/09\/27\/le-domande-che-non-avrei-voluto-fare\/65084\/","http:\/\/www.ipezzimancanti.it\/download\/Audizione%20superstite%20Vullo.pdf","http:\/\/www.corriere.it\/cronache\/09_aprile_22\/pentito_stragi_antimafia_bianconi_6cf4e8ee-2efe-11de-89c1-00144f02aabc.shtml","http:\/\/www.ecorav.it\/arci\/cronaca\/scheda6\/scheda6.htm","http:\/\/www.ilfattoquotidiano.it\/2010\/12\/19\/gli-ultimi-giorni-di-paolo-borsellino\/82520\/","http:\/\/www.processionemisteritp.it\/per_non_dimenticare\/replica%20_borselliino_a_mancino.htm","http:\/\/www.ammazzatecitutti.org\/articoli\/070719_alfano_borsellino.htm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20090612185524\/http:\/\/www.ammazzatecitutti.org\/articoli\/070719_alfano_borsellino.htm","http:\/\/blog.panorama.it\/italia\/2007\/07\/19\/strage-di-via-damelio-15-anni-dopo-ancora-troppi-dubbi\/","http:\/\/www.ilgiornale.it\/interni\/il_fratello_borsellino_mancino_ora_sveli_perche_incontro_paolo\/17-07-2007\/articolo-id=193201-page=0-comments=1","http:\/\/www.ipezzimancanti.it\/?p=721","http:\/\/autonomamente.altervista.org\/?p=607","http:\/\/www.poliziaedemocrazia.it\/live\/index.php?domain=archivio&action=articolo&idArticolo=286","https:\/\/ricerca.repubblica.it\/repubblica\/archivio\/repubblica\/1999\/02\/14\/borsellino-bis-sette-ergastoli-credibile-il-pentito.html?ref=search","http:\/\/www.adnkronos.com\/IGN\/News\/Politica\/Ciancimino-Forza-Italia-frutto-trattativa-tra-Stato-e-Cosa-nostra-dopo-stragi-92_4287926665.html","http:\/\/www.ilsecoloxix.it\/p\/italia\/2009\/07\/19\/AMg4NNlC-cerimonia_riina_delitto.shtml","http:\/\/it.notizie.yahoo.com\/strage-via-damelio-quattro-nuovi-arresti-borsellino-sapeva-104100019.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20130921061356\/http:\/\/it.notizie.yahoo.com\/strage-via-damelio-quattro-nuovi-arresti-borsellino-sapeva-104100019.html"]}
{"title":"1992 Aden hotel bombings","article":"The 1992 Aden hotel bombings were two terrorist bomb attacks carried out by al-Qaeda on December 29, 1992, that were intended to kill United States Marines in Aden, Yemen. It is considered to be the first attack on the United States by Al-Qaeda, though the objective was unsuccessful.\n\n==Attacks==\nOn December 29, 1992, the Islamist terrorist group al-Qaeda detonated a bomb at the Gold Mohur Hotel in Aden, Yemen, where United States Marine Corps would be staying while on their way to Somalia to participate in Operation Restore Hope. This is considered to be the first attack on the United States by al-Qaeda, though the objective was unsuccessful, as the troops had already left before the bomb was detonated. However, an Austrian tourist and a hotel employee were killed and four Austrian tourists were injured.\n\nA second bomb detonated prematurely at the Aden M\u00f6venpick Hotel, where other United States Marines had also been staying, and three people were injured, none of whom were Americans. At the time, the bombings did not give the United States cause for concern because no Americans had died. In April 1993, intelligence believed that Osama bin Laden had a role in the attacks. Immediately after the bombings, the US announced the withdrawal of troops from Yemen, the place it was using to support operations in Somalia.\n\n==Motives==\nAl-Qaeda intended this first attack against the United States as part of a larger campaign. At the time, the United States had been intervening in Somalia in an effort to stabilize the country and get aid to those who were in need during a military campaign known as Operation Restore Hope. Earlier in 1992, al-Qaeda allegedly was training Somali militants to fight against US forces. Links have been made between this training and the devastation of the Battle of Mogadishu in 1993, which resulted in 18 deaths and 80 wounded US troops. In March 1997, bin Laden said, \"With Allah\u2019s grace, Muslims over there cooperated with some Arab mujahideen who were in Afghanistan\u2026 against the American occupation troops and killed large numbers of them,\" in an interview on CNN.\n\nIn 1998, bin Laden would take credit for the bombings, claiming, \"The United States wanted to set up a military base for US soldiers in Yemen, so that it could send fresh troops to Somalia\u2026 The Arab mujaheddin related to the Afghan jihad carried out two bomb explosions in Yemen to warn the United States, causing damage to some Americans staying in those hotels. The United States received our warning and gave up the idea of setting up its military bases in Yemen. This was the first al-Qaeda victory scored against the Crusaders.\" This was not entirely true, since no Americans were injured or killed, nor did the United States recognize this action as a warning. At the time, \"The troops went on to Somalia as scheduled, but the triumphant leaders of al-Qaeda said that they had frightened the Americans away and scored an easy victory.\"\n\n==References==","urls":[]}
{"title":"Shankill Road bombing","article":"The Shankill Road bombing was carried out by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) on 23 October 1993 and is one of the most notorious incidents of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The IRA aimed to assassinate the leadership of the loyalist Ulster Defence Association (UDA), supposedly attending a meeting above Frizzell's fish shop on the Shankill Road, Belfast. Two IRA members disguised as deliverymen entered the shop carrying a bomb, which detonated prematurely. Ten people were killed: one of the IRA bombers, a UDA member and eight Protestant civilians, two of whom were children. More than fifty people were wounded. The targeted office was empty at the time of the bombing, but the IRA had allegedly realised that the tightly-packed area below would inevitably cause \"collateral damage\" of civilian casualties and continued regardless. It is alleged that British intelligence failed to act on a tip off about the bombing.\n\nThe loyalist Shankill Road had been the location of other bomb and gun attacks, including the Balmoral Furniture Company bombing in 1971 and Bayardo Bar attack in 1975, but the 1993 bombing had the most casualties. It resulted in a wave of revenge attacks by loyalists, who killed 14 civilians in the week that followed, almost all of them Catholics. The deadliest attack was the Greysteel massacre.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the early 1990s, loyalist paramilitaries drastically increased their attacks on the Irish Catholic and Irish nationalist community and \u2013 for the first time since the beginning of the Troubles \u2013 were responsible for more deaths than republicans. The UDA's West Belfast brigade, and its commander Johnny Adair, played a key role in this. Adair had become the group's commander in 1990.\n\nThe UDA's Shankill headquarters was above Frizzell's fish shop on the Shankill Road. The UDA's Inner Council and West Belfast brigade regularly met there on Saturdays. Peter Taylor says it was also the office of the Loyalist Prisoners' Association (LPA), and on Saturday mornings was normally crowded, as that was when money was given to prisoners' families. According to Henry McDonald and Jim Cusack, the IRA had the building under surveillance for some time. They say that the IRA decided to strike when one of their scouts spotted Adair entering the building on the morning of Saturday 23 October 1993. Later, in a secretly-recorded conversation with police, Adair confirmed that he had been in the building that morning.\n\n==The bombing==\nThe IRA's Belfast Brigade launched an operation to assassinate the UDA's top commanders, whom it believed were at the meeting. The plan allegedly was for two IRA members to enter the shop with a time bomb, force out the customers at gunpoint and flee before it exploded; killing those at the meeting. As they believed the meeting was being held in the room above the shop, the bomb was designed to send the blast upwards. IRA members maintained that they would have warned the customers as the bomb was primed. It had an eleven-second fuse, and the IRA stated that this would have allowed just enough time to clear the downstairs shop but not enough for those upstairs to escape.\n\nThe operation would be carried out by Thomas Begley and Se\u00e1n Kelly, two IRA members in their early twenties from Ardoyne. They drove from Ardoyne to the Shankill in a hijacked blue Ford Escort, which they parked on Berlin Street, around the corner from Frizzell's. Dressed as deliverymen, they entered the shop with the five-pound bomb in a holdall. It was shortly after 1\u00a0pm on a Saturday afternoon and the area was crowded with mostly women and children. Whilst Kelly waited at the door, Begley made his way through the customers towards the counter, where the bomb detonated prematurely. Forensic evidence showed that Begley had been holding the bomb over the refrigerated serving counter when it exploded. Begley was killed along with nine other people, two of them children. They were the owner John Frizzell (63); his daughter Sharon McBride (29); Leanne Murray (13); UDA member Michael Morrison (27); his partner Evelyn Baird (27) and their daughter Michelle (7); George Williamson (63) and his wife Gillian (49); and Wilma McKee (38). The force of the blast caused the old building to collapse into a pile of rubble. The upper floor came down upon those inside the shop, crushing many of the survivors under the rubble, where they remained until rescued some hours later by volunteers and emergency services. About 57 people were injured. At the scene during the rescue operation were several senior loyalists, including Adair and Billy McQuiston. The latter had been in a pub on the nearest corner when the bomb went off. Among those rescued from the rubble was the badly-wounded Se\u00e1n Kelly.\n\nUnknown to the IRA, if a UDA meeting had taken place, it had ended early and those attending it had left the building before the bomb exploded. McDonald and Cusack state that Adair and his men had stopped using the room for important meetings, allegedly because a sympathiser within the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) told Adair that the police had it bugged.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nThere was great anger and outrage in the Shankill in the wake of the bombing. Billy McQuiston told journalist Peter Taylor that \"anybody on the Shankill Road that day, from a Boy Scout to a granny, if you'd given them a gun they would have gone out and retaliated\". Many Protestants saw the bombing as an indiscriminate attack on them. Adair believed that the bomb was meant for him. Two days after the bombing, as Adair was driving away from his house, he stopped and told a police officer \"I'm away to plan a mass murder\".\n\nIn the week following the bombing, the UDA and UVF launched a wave of \"revenge attacks\", killing 14 civilians. The UDA shot a Catholic delivery driver in Belfast after luring him to a bogus call just a few hours after the bombing. He died on 25 October. On 26 October, the UDA shot dead another two Catholic civilians and wounded five in an indiscriminate attack at a Council Depot on Kennedy Way, Belfast. On 30 October, UDA members entered a pub in Greysteel frequented by Catholics and again opened fire indiscriminately. Eight civilians (six Catholics and two Protestants) were killed and 13 were wounded. This became known as the Greysteel massacre. The UDA stated it was a direct retaliation for the Shankill Road bombing. Michael Stone and another UDA member said that Adair also vowed to launch simultaneous attacks on Catholics attending mass in Belfast. The day after the attack (Sunday), the security forces were sent to guard all Catholic churches in Belfast. A UDA member said that a carload of gunmen were sent to attack Holy Family Catholic Church on the Limestone Road, but called off the attack due to the high security. Adair denied the claims. The UVF killed three Catholic men and a 15-year-old boy, with shootings around Belfast later in the year.\n\nAt Begley's wake, a British soldier fired upon a group of mourners standing outside Begley's home. The soldier fired twenty shots from a passing Land Rover. Among those wounded was republican activist Eddie Copeland, who needed extensive surgery. The court heard that the soldiers had been shown a photograph of Copeland before being sent on patrol. The soldier who fired the shots, Trooper Andrew Clarke, was jailed for ten years for attempted murder. Begley was given a well-attended republican funeral in west Belfast. Gerry Adams, president of Sinn F\u00e9in, used \"unusually strong language\" in condemning the bombing, saying it was wrong and could not be excused. However, he was criticised for being a pall-bearer at Begley's funeral. David McKittrick and Eamonn Mallie wrote that if Adams had shunned the funeral it would have been \"the end of him as a republican leader\". They explain that it would have severely damaged his credibility within the republican movement and made it difficult for him to secure an IRA ceasefire. Others, such as Taoiseach Albert Reynolds and RUC Chief Constable Hugh Annesley, agreed with this view.\n\nSe\u00e1n Kelly, the surviving IRA member, was badly wounded in the blast, having lost his left eye and was unable to move his left arm. Upon his release from hospital, however, he was arrested and convicted of nine counts of murder, each with a corresponding life sentence. In July 2000, he was released under the terms of the Belfast Agreement. In an interview shortly after his release, he said he had never intended to kill innocent people and regrets what happened.\n\nRelatives of those killed in the Shankill Road bombing adopted different positions during the 20th anniversary commemorative events in 2013.\n\n==Informer allegations==\nIn 2016, allegations were made that the IRA commander who planned the bombing was a police informer for the RUC's Special Branch, and that he told his handlers of the planned attack. This information allegedly came from classified documents stolen by the IRA from Castlereagh RUC base in 2002. IRA members believe the informer was given the go-ahead by his handlers to rig the bomb so that it exploded prematurely. They believe the goal was to cause mass civilian casualties, weakening those in the IRA who opposed a ceasefire and who wanted to continue the armed campaign. Relatives of the victims asked the Police Ombudsman to investigate whether police knew about the attack before it happened.\n\n==See also==\n*Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions (1990\u201399)\n*Timeline of Ulster Defence Association actions\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n* BBC interview with victim of the attack\n* BBC on Johnny Adair\n* BBC on Sean Kelly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScene of the bombing, as of 2011.","urls":["http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/cgi-bin\/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&day=23&month=10&year=1993","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-northern-ireland-45943874","http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/uk\/home-news\/shankill-road-bombing-the-history-of-collusion-between-mi5-and-the-ira-a6833586.html","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/northern_ireland\/821698.stm","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/uk_news\/story\/0,3604,350605,00.html","http:\/\/www.nuzhound.com\/articles\/irish_news\/arts2003\/oct21_black_week_in_history.php","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/victims\/memorials\/static\/photos\/1130.html","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/sutton\/chron\/1993.html","http:\/\/www.rte.ie\/news\/1999\/0519\/1767-republican\/","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/uk\/294812.stm","http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/magazine\/printout\/0,8816,162636,00.html","https:\/\/archive.is\/20120526234825\/www.time.com\/time\/magazine\/printout\/0,8816,162636,00.html","http:\/\/historical-debates.oireachtas.ie\/D\/0435\/D.0435.199310270136.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110607093545\/http:\/\/historical-debates.oireachtas.ie\/D\/0435\/D.0435.199310270136.html","http:\/\/www.preventgenocide.org\/prevent\/news-monitor\/2001oct.htm","http:\/\/www.irishnews.com\/news\/2016\/01\/25\/news\/top-level-agent-gave-information-on-shankill-attack-393522\/","https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/uk\/home-news\/shankill-road-bomb-ira-double-agent-deliberately-set-device-to-explode-prematurely-a6833581.html"]}
{"title":"Via dei Georgofili bombing","article":"The via dei Georgofili bombing (Italian: Strage di via dei Georgofili) was a terrorist attack carried out by the Sicilian Mafia in the very early morning on 27 May 1993 outside the Uffizi in Florence, Italy.\n\nThe via dei Georgofili bombing was carried out with a Fiat Fiorino packed full of explosives, parked near the Torre dei Pulci, between the Uffizi museum and the Arno River. The edifice was the seat of the Accademia dei Georgofili. The large explosion caused the death of five people: Angela Fiume (36 years old), employee and caretaker of the Accademia; her husband Fabrizio Nencioni (39 years old), policeman; their daughters Caterina Nencioni (50 days old); and Nadia Nencioni (nine years old); and Dario Capolicchio (22 years old), a junior student at the architecture class at  the university. Forty-eight other people were injured by the blast. The tower and other buildings were destroyed and others damaged, including the Uffizi Gallery, where three paintings were heavily damaged or destroyed, including Adoration of the Shepherds (1620) by Gerard van Honthorst (later partially recovered).\n\nAfter Corleonesi Mafia clan boss Salvatore Riina was captured in January 1993, numerous terror attacks, including this one, were ordered as warning to its members to not turn state's witness, but also in response for the overruling of the Article 41-bis prison regime.\n\nIn June 1998, pentito Gaspare Spatuzza received a life sentence in relation to the bombing.\n\nIn 2000, Riina, Giuseppe Graviano, Leoluca Bagarella and Bernardo Provenzano were sentenced to life imprisonment for ordering the massacre.\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/firenze.repubblica.it\/cronaca\/2018\/05\/26\/news\/firenze_25_anni_fa_la_strage_dei_georgofili_le_in-197419376\/","http:\/\/www.theflorentine.net\/articles\/article-view.asp?issuetocId=7762","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140814160016\/http:\/\/theflorentine.net\/articles\/article-view.asp?issuetocId=7762","http:\/\/corrierefiorentino.corriere.it\/firenze\/notizie\/cronaca\/2011\/2-febbraio-2011\/strage-georgofili-aula-parla-spatuzza-181386709676.shtml","http:\/\/www.centroimpastato.it\/php\/crono.php3?searchitem=spatuzza","http:\/\/ricerca.repubblica.it\/repubblica\/archivio\/repubblica\/2008\/10\/15\/si-pente-il-sicario-di-don-puglisi.html","https:\/\/ricerca.repubblica.it\/repubblica\/archivio\/repubblica\/2000\/01\/22\/ergastolo-toto-riina-per-la-strage.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140408222433\/https:\/\/ricerca.repubblica.it\/repubblica\/archivio\/repubblica\/2000\/01\/22\/ergastolo-toto-riina-per-la-strage.html"]}
{"title":"AMIA bombing","article":"The AMIA bombing was a suicide van bomb attack on the Asociaci\u00f3n Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA; Argentine Israelite Mutual Association) building in Buenos Aires, Argentina on 18 July 1994, killing 85 people and injuring hundreds. The bombing is Argentina's deadliest terrorist attack to date. Argentina is home to a Jewish community of 230,000, the largest in Latin America and sixth in the world outside Israel (see Demographics of Argentina).\n\nOver the years, the case has been marked by accusations of cover-ups. All suspects in the \"local connection\" (among them, many members of the Buenos Aires Provincial Police) were found to be not guilty in September 2004. In August 2005, federal judge Juan Jos\u00e9 Galeano, in charge of the case, was impeached and removed from his post on a charge of \"serious\" irregularities due to mishandling of the investigation. In 2005, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, who would later become Pope Francis, was the first public personality to sign a petition for justice in the AMIA bombing case. He was one of the signatories on a document called \"85 victims, 85 signatures\" as part of the bombing's 11th anniversary.\n\nOn 25 October 2006, Argentine prosecutors Alberto Nisman and Marcelo Mart\u00ednez Burgos formally accused the government of Iran of directing the bombing, and the Hezbollah militia of carrying it out.\nAccording to the prosecution's claims in 2006, Argentina had been targeted by Iran after Buenos Aires' decision to suspend a nuclear technology transfer contract to Tehran. This has been disputed because the contract was never terminated and Iran and Argentina were negotiating on restoration of full cooperation on all agreements from early 1992 until 1994, when the bombing occurred.\n\nIn 2015 Alberto Nisman filed a 300-page document accusing former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of covering up Iran's role in the incident. Nisman was murdered hours before he was due to testify against the former president, which the Federal Court of Buenos Aires ruled was a \u201cdirect consequence\u201d of Nisman's accusations against Kirchner. In 2017, Judge Claudio Bonadio accused Kirchner of treason and called on the country's senate to permit her arrest and trial for allegedly covering up Iranian involvement in the 1994 bomb attack. Kirchner is currently referred for public trial over alleged cover-up of Iranian involvement in the bombing.\n\nThe thirteenth anniversary of the bombing was commemorated on 18 July 2007. In addition to nationwide exhibitions and ceremonies, radio and television stations and police cars all across Argentina sounded sirens at 9:53\u00a0am, the time of the bombing. In 2019, Argentina officially declared Hezbollah a terrorist organization.\n\n==Bombing==\nOn 18 July 1994, a suicide bomber drove a Renault Trafic van bomb loaded with about  of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and fuel oil explosive mixture, into the Jewish Community Center building located in a densely constructed commercial area of Buenos Aires. The explosive is thought to have been arranged to focus the blast on the building  away, exhibiting a shaped charge or explosively formed penetrator effect. The exterior walls of this five story building were of brick masonry construction, which supported the floor slabs. The air blast from the bomb totally destroyed the exposed load-bearing walls which, in turn, led to progressive failure of the floor slabs and virtually total collapse of the building. Such bearing-wall buildings are notable for their tendency to be brought down in this manner by localized damage.\n\nIn the days following the bombing, Israel sent Mossad agents to Argentina to investigate. The Israeli Police also sent a team of four forensic scientists to assist with the building of ante mortem files and victim identification; the IDF sent personnel to help the Argentines with body extrication. Argentina closed its borders after the attack, fearing more terrorists could enter. It was thought possible that the bombers entered Argentina through the Triple Frontier, where the borders of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay meet. Argentina's intelligence agency, the Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia (SIDE), is said to have set up a network of surveillance called \"Centauro\" in Paraguay.\n\n===Other bombings===\nThe bombing came two years after the 17 March 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires which killed 29 and wounded 242, and was Argentina's deadliest attack until the AMIA bombing. The Islamic Jihad Organization, which according to Robert Baer operates under the umbrella of Hezbollah and is linked to Iran, claimed responsibility for that bombing. It was suspected that the AMIA bombing was connected to the embassy attack. To date, authorities have been unable to locate those responsible for either of the two bombings.\n\nThe day after the AMIA attack, a suicide bombing on a Panamanian commuter plane killed all 21 passengers, 12 of whom were Jews. Investigators determined that the bombing was perpetrated by a \"Lya Jamal\" \u2013 thought to be \"an Arab traveling under an alias, using fraudulently obtained Colombian documents.\"\n\nEight days after the AMIA attack, the Israeli embassy in London was car-bombed, and thirteen hours later a similar car bomb exploded outside a Jewish community centre in London. No one was killed but 22 were injured and \"millions of pounds of damage\" was done. Five Palestinians were later arrested in London and two convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison in connection with the bombings.\n\n==Investigation and responsibility==\n\n\nIn 2018 judicial authorities announced that former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner would face trial on charges she covered up the role of Iranians in bombing. Federal Judge Claudio Bonadio said that eleven other former officials and people close to Kirchner's government will also be tried on charges of cover-up and abuse of power. Kirchner has denied the charges.\n\nNo suspects have been convicted for the bombing and there have been a number of allegations made, with later investigations charging the government of Iran. The investigations were marred by incompetence. In 1999 an arrest warrant was issued against Hezbollah member Imad Mugniyah in connection with the attack. Argentine justice accused Tehran in 2006 of being behind the attacks, and indicted several senior Iranian officials, including Hashemi Rafsanjani and Ahmad Vahidi, as well as Hezbollah's Imad Mughniyah. In 2007, several of the charged were placed on Interpol's most wanted list, however Interpol's bylaws prevented listing top officials such as Rafsanjani. As of 2017 the charged suspects (who remain alive) remain fugitives.\n\n===Claim of responsibility===\nShortly after the attack Ansar Allah, a Palestinian Jihadist organization widely held as a front for Hezbollah, claimed responsibility for the attack, and for the Alas Chiricanas Flight 901 bombing via leaflets distributed in Sidon and a communique in the Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar.\n\n===Ibrahim Hussein Berro===\nIsraeli diplomatic sources who read the \"final\" report by SIDE on the attack said in 2003 that the attack was a suicide bombing carried out by Ibrahim Hussein Berro, a 21-year-old Hezbollah operative who has been honored with a plaque in southern Lebanon for his \"martyrdom\" on 18 July 1994, the date of the bombing. This investigation was carried out jointly with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. Hussein had been identified by FBI and Argentine intelligence, and corroborated by at least three witnesses. According to official Argentine government prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, Hussein's two US-based brothers had testified that he had joined the radical Shia militant group Hezbollah. \"The brothers' testimony was substantial, rich in detail and showed that he was the one who was killed,\" Nisman added.\n\nHowever, a BBC correspondent reported that \"independent\" investigators were skeptical, and they pointed out repeated incompetence and deception in the official investigation. No proper autopsies or DNA tests were done. The police had also simply dumped a head, thought to be that of the bomber, into a bin.\n\nOn 5 July 2017, The Algemeiner reported that DNA not assignable to any of the victims has been identified. This new evidence will allow investigators to test the prevailing suspicion that the bombing was committed by  Ibrahim Hussein Berro.\n\n===Juan Jos\u00e9 Galeano's investigations===\nFederal judge Juan Jos\u00e9 Galeano followed investigations concerning the \"local connection\", which included members of the Polic\u00eda Bonaerense (Buenos Aires Provincial Police). He quickly arrested Carlos Telleld\u00edn, alleged to have provided the van used in the bombing, and some 20 officers from the Bonaerense. But a video broadcast on Argentine TV showed him offering Telleld\u00edn $400,000, in return for evidence, which led to Galeano's removal from the case in 2003, and his impeachment in August 2005.\n\nJudge Galeano had also issued warrants for the arrests of 12 Iranians, including Hade Soleimanpour, Iran's ambassador to Argentina in 1994. The latter was arrested in the UK on 21 August 2003, at the request of the Argentine authorities. He was later released because, according to the Home Office, there was not even enough evidence presented to make a prima facie case for the extradition to proceed.\n\nJudge Galeano also interviewed Abolghasem Mesbahi, aka \"Witness C\", an alleged former Iranian intelligence officer who reportedly said a former Argentine president accepted a $10 million payment from Tehran to block the investigation. Former President Carlos Menem denied the claims, but admitted he had a secret Swiss bank account following a report in The New York Times. Menem claimed in 2004 that the attack had been related to his support to the US during the First Gulf War and to his visit to Israel during his mandate. Abolghasem Mesbahi claimed to the Argentine court that Iran had planned the bombing, thinking the centre was a base for the Israeli secret service.\n\nOn 2 September 2004, all suspects in the \"local connection\" (among whom members of the Buenos Aires police) of AMIA case were found to be not guilty. Five persons, including four policemen, were therefore acquitted because of lack of evidence.\n\nOn 3 August 2005, Judge Galeano's impeachment was successful, and he was formally removed from his post as a federal judge for \"serious\" irregularities and his mishandling of the investigation. Argentine newspaper Clar\u00edn reports that charges will be pressed against him shortly. Judge Galeano has denied these allegations.\n\nIn March 2005, Swiss judge Jacques Antenen, in charge of investigations concerning the murder of an Iranian dissident, re-opened the case concerning Iranian intelligence service bank accounts in Switzerland. The same account would have been used both for this assassination and for the alleged payment of ex-President Carlos Menem. Swiss Justice had already been notified of the existence of an account owned by the Red Spark Foundation (based in Liechtenstein), in which Ram\u00f3n Hern\u00e1ndez, former secretary of Carlos Menem, had authority to sign documents. Six million dollars would have been deposited in this account, although in some moment the exact amount was said to be of $10 million.\n\nIn 2006, the Court of Cassation declared that the previous court had made a false version of the investigated acts in order to cover irresponsibilities.\n\n===Investigations under N\u00e9stor Kirchner's government===\nN\u00e9stor Kirchner's government issued a decree in July 2005 formally accepting a share of the blame for the failure of investigations about the attack. He called the unresolved investigations a \"national disgrace.\". President Kirchner said governments had covered up facts, and that the decree established a mechanism for victims to receive compensation. Shortly after assuming his functions in spring 2003, he opened up Argentine intelligence files on the case, and lifted a decree preventing SIDE agents from testifying in the case.\n\nArgentina's justice, Israel, and the United States suspected in 2005 that Hezbollah was behind the attack, with backing from Iran. Hezbollah has denied responsibility. The Iranian government maintains its innocence, condemning the terrorist attack and calling for urgent punishment of those responsible.\n\nOn 25 October 2006, prosecutors in Buenos Aires formally charged Iran and Shi'a militia Hezbollah with the bombing, accusing the Iranian authorities of directing Hezbollah to carry out the attack and calling for the arrest of former President of Iran Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani and seven others, including some who still hold official positions in Iran.\n\nThe Justice of Argentine called for the arrest of top Iranian authorities. The Iranian defense minister, Ahmad Vahidi was accused of masterminding the attack.\n\nArgentine's government required the extradition of those accused of the attack but Iran has always refused to accept the verdict of the Argentine's Justice.\n\nIn November 2007, Interpol on behalf of the Argentine government, published the names of six individuals (Imad Mughniyah, Ali Fallahijan, Mohsen Rabbani, Ahmad Reza Asghari, Ahmad Vahidi and Mohsen Rezaee) officially accused for their role in the terrorist attack. They were entered in the Interpol red notice list.\n\nSpeaking on state radio, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hoseyni described the accusations against the country as \"a Zionist plot\". Both Hezbollah and Iran deny any involvement in the bombing. According to Hoseyni, the accusations were intended to divert \"world attention from the perpetration of crimes by the Zionists against women and children in Palestine\".\n\nOn 6 March 2007, former Congressman Mario Cafiero and former government official Luis D'Elia provided evidence at a press conference that Abolghasem Mesbahi, along with two other Iranians that gave alleged evidence implicating Iran in the bombing, were members of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK), which is an organization that advocates the overthrow of the Islamic Republic of Iran and was designated until 2012 as a terrorist organization by the US. They also said that there were arrest warrants issued by Interpol for the other two Iranians, Hadi Roshanravani and Hamid Reza Eshagi.\n\n===Developments under Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner's government===\n\nIn November 2008, Carlos Menem was called to testify in an upcoming trial over the AMIA case.\n\nIn March 2009, a former investigator in the case, Claudio Lifschitz, claimed he was abducted and tortured by men who told him not to investigate SIDE's involvement in the case.\n\nIn August 2009, BBC News reported that Ahmad Vahidi had become Iran's defense minister-designate under the 2009 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad administration, and is on Interpol's wanted list over the AMIA bombing. Vahidi led a unit of Iran's Revolutionary Guard called Quds Force at the time of the attack, and has been accused of planning the bombings. Iran dismissed this development as a \"Zionist plot\". On 1 June 2011, Bolivia apologized to Argentina for Ahmad Vahidi's unannounced visit to the country, and announced that he would be leaving Bolivia immediately.\n\nOn 31 March 2012, Menem was ordered to stand trial for obstruction of justice in the probe of the AMIA bombing. Menem is accused of helping to cover up the tracks of local accomplices of the attackers.\n\nIn 2012, Argentina's President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner announced at the United Nations General Assembly that Iran and Argentina would meet to discuss Iranian involvement in the attacks. In 2014  she also criticized her country's Jewish leaders for not supporting Argentina's pact with Iran in order to jointly investigate the 1994 AMIA bombing attack:\n\n\nMy country is the only country of the Americas other than the United States of America that was the target of terrorist attacks: one in 1992 when the embassy of Israel was blown up, and the second in 1994 when the headquarters of the Asociaci\u00f3n Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA) was bombed. This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the bombing of AMIA. I dare say before this Assembly\u2014in the presence of some of the family members of the victims who have always been with us\u2014that the Government headed by President Kirchner did the utmost and went the greatest lengths to uncover the real culprits, not only because it opened all my country's intelligence files and created a special prosecutor investigation unit, but also because, when in 2006 the justice system of my country accused Iranian citizens of involvement in the bombing of AMIA, I myself was the only President who dared to propose asking the Islamic Republic of Iran to cooperate with and assist in the investigation. That request was made intermittently from 2007 to 2011, until the Islamic Republic of Iran finally agreed to a bilateral meeting, allowing it to be included in the agenda. That meeting led to the signing by both countries of a memorandum of understanding on legal cooperation that allowed for the Iranian citizens who had been accused, and who live in Tehran, to be deposed before the judge. But what happened when we signed that memorandum? It seemed as if all hell had broken out, both nationally and internationally. The Jewish associations that had sought our support for so many years and that had come here with us to ask for help turned against us, and when an agreement was finally reached on legal cooperation they accused us of complicity with the State of Iran. The same thing happened here in the United States. When the vulture funds lobbied before the United States Congress, they accused us of collaborating with the Islamic Republic of Iran, which at the time was known as the Terrorist State of Iran. They even lobbied on their websites, posting pictures of me on the Internet with former President Ahmadinejad as if we were business partners. Just this week, we learned that the iconic Waldorf Astoria hotel, in this city, was the setting for a meeting between the Secretary of State of this country and his Iranian counterpart. We are not criticizing them. Quite the contrary, anything that represents dialogue and understanding seems very good to us. But we wish to ask those who have been accusing Iran of being a terrorist State.\n\nArgentina's Foreign Minister Hector Timerman and Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi met on the sidelines of the UN in New York and promised to continue talks until the 1990s bombings are resolved.\n\n==Memorandum of understanding==\n\n\nOn 27 January 2013, the Government of Argentina announced it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Iran to establish a \"truth commission\" to investigate the AMIA bombing. According to President Kirchner, the commission was established to \"analyze all the documentation presented to date by the judicial authorities of Argentina and Iran\u2026and to give its vision and issue a report with recommendations about how the case should proceed within the legal and regulatory framework of both parties.\"\n \nThe news generated several criticisms with David Harris from the American Jewish Committee stating that \"the idea of establishing a 'truth' commission on the AMIA tragedy that involves the Iranian regime would be like asking Nazi Germany to help establish the facts of Kristallnacht\". The U.S. State Department's top official in charge of Latin American affairs, Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson, said she is \"skeptical that a just solution can be found\" through the Argentine-Iran \"truth-commission.\" The Jewish community in Argentina issued the statement \"to ignore everything that Argentine justice has done and to replace it with a commission that, in the best of cases, will issue, without any defined deadline, a 'recommendation' to the parties constitutes, without doubt, a reversal in the common objective of obtaining justice.\"\n\nOn 28 February 2013, the Argentine Chamber of Deputies approved the memorandum of understanding with Iran by 131 votes in favor to 113 votes against. Israel expressed disappointment at this development. Guillermo Borger, president of the AMIA, criticized the legality of the memorandum and announced that he would take it to the Supreme Court of Argentina.\n\nIn May 2014, the memorandum was declared unconstitutional by the Court. The memorandum was voided when Mauricio Macri became president of Argentina, as he withdrew the appeal that the Kirchners government had filed.\n\n==Recent developments==\n\nOn 24 May 2013, it was reported that two of the Iranian AMIA bombing suspects accused of having planned the attack, Mohsen Rezai and Ali Akbar Velayati, are current candidates for the Iranian presidential elections. In May 2013, Prosecutor Alberto Nisman published a 502-page indictment accusing Iran of establishing terrorist networks throughout Latin America \u2013 including in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Chile, Colombia, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and Suriname \u2013 dating back to the 1980s. Nisman also said new evidence underscored the responsibility of Mohsen Rabbani, the former Iranian cultural attache in Argentina, as mastermind of the AMIA bombing and \"coordinator of the Iranian infiltration of South America, especially in Guyana\", and said US court documents showed Islamist militant Abdul Kadir \u2013 who was sentenced to life in prison in 2010 for participating in a foiled plan to attack John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York \u2013 was Rabbani's disciple.\n\nThe JTA reports that ex-interior minister of Argentina, Carlos Vladimir Corach, is to be investigated for his ties to the AMIA Jewish center bombing. He is alleged to have provided an illegal payment of $400,000 to Carlos Telleldin.\n\n\nIn an interview with Buenos Aires-based Jewish news agency (Agencia Jud\u00eda de Noticias) on 2 January 2013, Itzhak Aviran, who was the Israeli ambassador to Argentina from 1993 to 2000, said most of the people behind the AMIA attack were eliminated by Israeli security agents operating abroad. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor called Aviran's declarations \"complete nonsense\".\n\nIn January 2015, the prosecutor in charge of the AMIA bombing investigation, Alberto Nisman, filed a 300-page complaint accusing President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner and Foreign Minister H\u00e9ctor Timerman among other pro-government political figures of \"covering up\" Iranian citizens allegedly involved in the 1994 attack. Nisman said his accusations were based on phone taps on close political allies of Fern\u00e1ndez, who he said conspired in a \"sophisticated criminal plan\" to negotiate with Rabbani himself, one of the main suspects of perpetrating the deadly bombing. According to the accusation, Iranian oil would be exchanged for Argentinian grain, while Argentina would cancel an international Interpol arrest warrant against Rabbani and other senior Iranian officials. Nisman demanded a preventive embargo of 200 million pesos on Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner and requested to question her, as well as Timerman, lawmaker of the pro-government organization \"La C\u00e1mpora\" Andr\u00e9s Larroque, political leader Luis D'El\u00eda, the leader of Quebracho Fernando Esteche, members of Secretariat of Intelligence, the leader of the Iranian community in Argentina Jorge \"Yussuf\" Khali, and ex attorney and judge H\u00e9ctor Yrimia. On 18 January 2015, Nisman was found dead at his home in Buenos Aires, hours before he was due to explain his allegations at the Argentine parliament. A gun and spent shell casing were found next to the body, and a government official said the death was likely a suicide although others considered the death suspicious. The judge Ariel Lijo returned immediately from his vacations to work in the case, and to order the protection of Nisman's proofs. Nisman was replaced by prosecutor Alberto Gentili.\n\nIn the week following Nisman's death, and despite the fact that Nisman was going to implicate her among others had he lived, President Kirschner declared her determination to replace the Argentinian secret security service completely because it had been run beyond the state's control for too long.\n\nIn March 2015, three former Venezuelan government officials interviewed by Veja stated that Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad allegedly met in 2007 to discuss payments to the Argentine government of Cristina Kirchner in order for Iran to receive Argentine nuclear technology and the cessation of work between Argentina and Interpol involving Iranian individuals.\n\nIn March 2015, the Argentinian government released a full-page advertisement in national newspapers accusing the late prosecutor Alberto Nisman of having attempted to destabilise the country. The advertisement also argued that the country should revive a controversial agreement with Iran, the country that is suspected of being responsible for the bombings. In addition to that, during a speech president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner accused Israel of being responsible for the 1992 bombing of the Israeli embassy in Argentina. This accusation was based on the allegation that Israel was only demanding justice for the AMIA bombing but not for the embassy attack. This was immediately refuted by the Israeli embassy, which reaffirmed that it does in fact demand justice for both cases.\n\nIn December 2015, Radio Mitre, an Argentinean station, released secret tapes of H\u00e9ctor Timerman, in which he admitted Iran was responsible for the bombings concurrent to negotiating with Iran.\n\nOn 26 February 2016, the Argentine prosecutor Ricardo S\u00e1enz stated Nisman's death \"was a homicide indeed\", claiming the case should be directed to the federal justice.\n\nOn 18 July 2019, at the request of Israel and the United States, Argentina officially declares Hezbollah a terrorist organization, freezing assets and expelling all members of the organization from the country, which is held responsible for the 1994 attack against AMIA.\n\n==Alleged assassinations of perpetrators==\nIn January 2014, Yitzhak Aviran, who had been Israel's ambassador to Argentina at the time, claimed in an interview with a Spanish-language Jewish newspaper that most of the perpetrators of the attack had been tracked down and killed by Mossad, Israel's secret service, saying \"a majority of those responsible for the act are no longer alive, and we took care of this on our own.\"  Aviran's statements caused concern in Argentina, whose Foreign Minister, H\u00e9ctor Timerman, accused Israel of having thus \"prevented the gathering of new evidence that could shed light on the affair.\" Argentina also summoned the Israeli charg\u00e9 d'affaires to ask for explanations about Aviran's statements. For its part, the Israeli government, through its own Foreign Ministry, dismissed Aviran's claims as \"complete nonsense.\"\n\n==Other opinions==\nAccording to a report in The Nation, the author claims that James Cheek, United States Ambassador to Argentina at the time of the bombing, told him, \"To my knowledge, there was never any real evidence [of Iranian responsibility]. They never came up with anything.\" The hottest lead in the case, he recalled, was an Iranian defector named Manoucher Moatamer, who \"supposedly had all this information.\" But Moatamer turned out to be only a dissatisfied low-ranking official without the knowledge of government decision-making that he had claimed. \"We finally decided that he wasn't credible,\" Cheek recalled.\n\n==Cultural depictions==\n\nTen years after the terrorist attack, a group of 10 Argentine directors, each financed by a different production company, filmed a collection of 10 shorts in tribute to the victims of the attack. The shorts were collected in the film 18-j, dubbed thus in reference to the date of the attack. The directors were Daniel Burman, Israel Adri\u00e1n Caetano, Luc\u00eda Cedr\u00f3n, Alejandro Doria, Alberto Lecchi, Sergio Ren\u00e1n, Marcelo Schapces, Carlos Sor\u00edn, Juan Bautista Stagnaro, Adri\u00e1n Suar and Mauricio Wainrot; a small introduction was narrated by actress Norma Aleandro. Each short showed a different scene in the lives of those who witnessed the attack first-hand. The film premiered 19 August 2004.\n\nIn 2009, Marcos Carnevale directed Anita, a full-length film which portrays a young woman (Alejandra Manzo) with Down Syndrome who is lost in Buenos Aires after her mother is killed in the AMIA bombing.\n\n==See also==\n\n* Israeli embassy attack in Buenos Aires\n* History of the Jews in Argentina\n* Argentina\u2013Israel relations\n* Pasteur - AMIA (Buenos

{"title":"Oklahoma City bombing","article":"The Oklahoma City bombing was a domestic terrorist truck bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States, on April 19, 1995. Perpetrated by American terrorists Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, the bombing happened at 9:02\u00a0am and killed at least 168 people, including many children, injured more than 680 others, and destroyed more than one third of the building, which had to be demolished. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings within a 16-block radius, shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings, and destroyed or burned 86 cars, causing an estimated $652\u00a0million worth of damage. Local, state, federal, and worldwide agencies engaged in extensive rescue efforts in the wake of the bombing. They and the city received substantial donations from across the country. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated 11 of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations. Until the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Oklahoma City bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack in the history of the United States. It remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history.\n\nWithin 90 minutes of the explosion, McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession. Forensic evidence quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days, both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, a veteran of the Gulf War and a sympathizer with the U.S. militia movement, had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives he parked in front of the building. Nichols had assisted with the bomb's preparation. Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and unhappy about its handling of the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the fire that ended the siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas.\n\nThe official FBI investigation, known as \"OKBOMB\", involved 28,000 interviews and collecting 3.5 short tons (3,200\u00a0kg) of evidence and nearly one billion pieces of information. The bombers were tried and convicted in 1997. Sentenced to death, McVeigh was executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001, at the U.S. federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison in 2004. Michael and Lori Fortier testified against McVeigh and Nichols; Michael Fortier was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to warn the United States government, and Lori received immunity from prosecution in exchange for her testimony.\n\nIn response to the bombing, the U.S. Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which tightened the standards for habeas corpus in the United States. It also passed legislation to increase the protection around federal buildings to deter future terrorist attacks. \n\nOn April 19, 2000, the Oklahoma City National Memorial was dedicated on the site of the Murrah Federal Building, commemorating the victims of the bombing. Remembrance services are held every year on April 19, at the time of the explosion.\n\n==Planning==\n===Motive===\n\nThe chief conspirators, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, met in 1988 at Fort Benning during basic training for the U.S. Army. McVeigh met Michael Fortier as his Army roommate. The three shared interests in survivalism. They expressed anger at the federal government's handling of the 1992 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) standoff with Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge, as well as the Waco siege, a 1993 51-day standoff between the FBI and Branch Davidian members that began with a botched Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) attempt to execute a search warrant. There was a firefight and ultimately a siege of the compound, resulting in the burning and shooting deaths of David Koresh and 75 others. In March 1993, McVeigh visited the Waco site during the standoff, and again after the siege ended. He later decided to bomb a federal building as a response to the raids.\n\n===Target selection===\n\nMcVeigh later said that he had contemplated assassinating Attorney General Janet Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others rather than attacking a building, and sometimes wished he had done so. He initially intended to destroy only a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be more powerful if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.\n\nA resident of Kingman, Arizona, McVeigh considered targets in Missouri, Arizona, Texas, and Arkansas. He said in his authorized biography that he wanted to minimize non-governmental casualties, so he ruled out a 40-story building in Little Rock, Arkansas, because a florist's shop occupied space on the ground floor. In December 1994, McVeigh and Fortier visited Oklahoma City to inspect McVeigh's target: the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. \n\nThe Murrah building had been targeted in October 1983 by white supremacist group The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord, including founder James Ellison and Richard Snell. The group had plotted to park \"a van or trailer in front of the Federal Building and blow it up with rockets detonated by a timer.\" After Snell's appeal for murdering two people in unrelated cases was denied, it happened that he was executed the same day as the Murrah bombing.\n\nThe nine-story building, built in 1977, was named for a federal judge and housed 14 federal agencies, including the DEA, ATF, Social Security Administration, and recruiting offices for the Army and Marine Corps. \n\nMcVeigh chose the Murrah building because he expected its glass front to shatter under the impact of the blast. He also believed that its adjacent large, open parking lot across the street might absorb and dissipate some of the force, and protect the occupants of nearby non-federal buildings. In addition, McVeigh believed that the open space around the building would provide better photo opportunities for propaganda purposes. He planned the attack for April 19, 1995, to coincide with the 2nd anniversary of the Waco siege and the 220th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord during the American Revolution.\n\n===Gathering materials===\nMcVeigh and Nichols purchased or stole the materials they needed to manufacture the bomb, and stored them in rented sheds. In August 1994, McVeigh obtained nine Kinestiks from gun collector Roger E. Moore, and ignited the devices with Nichols outside Nichols's home in Herington, Kansas. On September 30, 1994, Nichols bought forty  bags of ammonium nitrate fertilizer from Mid-Kansas Coop in McPherson, Kansas, enough to fertilize  of farmland at a rate of  of nitrogen per acre (.4 ha), an amount commonly used for corn. Nichols bought an additional  bag on October 18, 1994. McVeigh approached Fortier and asked him to assist with the bombing project, but he refused.\n\nMcVeigh and Nichols robbed Moore in his home of $60,000 worth of guns, gold, silver, and jewels, transporting the property in the victim's van. McVeigh wrote Moore a letter in which he claimed that the robbery had been committed by government agents. Items stolen from Moore were later found in Nichols's home and in a storage shed he had rented.\n\nIn October 1994, McVeigh showed Michael and Lori Fortier a diagram he had drawn of the bomb he wanted to build. McVeigh planned to construct a bomb containing more than  of ammonium nitrate fertilizer mixed with about  of liquid nitromethane and  of Tovex. Including the weight of the sixteen 55-U.S.-gallon drums in which the explosive mixture was to be packed, the bomb would have a combined weight of about . McVeigh originally intended to use hydrazine rocket fuel, but it proved too expensive. During the Chief Auto Parts Nationals, a round of the NHRA Winston Drag Racing Series at the Texas Motorplex, McVeigh posed as a motorcycle racer and attempted to purchase  drums of nitromethane on the pretext that he and some fellow bikers needed the fuel for racing. But there were no nitromethane-powered motorcycles at the meeting, and he did not have an NHRA competitors' license.  Representative Steve LeSueur refused to sell to him because he was suspicious of McVeigh's actions and attitudes, but sales representative Tim Chambers sold him three barrels. Chambers questioned the purchase of three barrels, when typically only 1\u20135 gallons of nitromethane, he noted, would be purchased by a Top Fuel Harley rider, and the class was not even raced that weekend.  LeSueur reported the incident to the FBI immediately after rejecting McVeigh's request.\n\nMcVeigh rented a storage space in which he stockpiled seven crates of  Tovex sausages, 80 spools of shock tube, and 500 electric blasting caps, which he and Nichols had stolen from a Martin Marietta Aggregates quarry in Marion, Kansas. He decided not to steal any of the  of ANFO (ammonium nitrate\/fuel oil) he found at the scene, as he did not believe it powerful enough (he did obtain 17 bags of ANFO from another source for use in the bomb). McVeigh made a prototype bomb that was detonated in the desert to avoid detection.\n\n\n\nLater, speaking about the military mindset with which he went about the preparations, he said, \"You learn how to handle killing in the military. I face the consequences, but you learn to accept it.\" He compared his actions to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, rather than the attack on Pearl Harbor, reasoning it was necessary to prevent more lives from being lost.\n\nOn April 14, 1995, McVeigh paid for a motel room at the Dreamland Motel in Junction City, Kansas. The next day he rented a 1993 Ford F-700 truck from Ryder under the name Robert D. Kling, an alias he adopted because he knew an Army soldier named Kling with whom he shared physical characteristics, and because it reminded him of the Klingon warriors of Star Trek. On April 16, 1995, he and Nichols drove to Oklahoma City, where he parked a getaway car, a yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis, several blocks from the Murrah Federal Building. The nearby Regency Towers Apartments' lobby security camera recorded images of Nichols's blue 1984 GMC pickup truck on April 16. After removing the car's license plate, he left a note covering the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) plate that read, \"Not abandoned. Please do not tow. Will move by April 23. (Needs battery & cable).\" Both men then returned to Kansas.\n\n===Building the bomb===\nOn April 17\u201318, 1995, McVeigh and Nichols removed the bomb supplies from their storage unit in Herington, Kansas, where Nichols lived, and loaded them into the Ryder rental truck. They then drove to Geary Lake State Park, where they nailed boards onto the floor of the truck to hold the 13\u00a0barrels in place and mixed the chemicals using plastic buckets and a bathroom scale. Each filled barrel weighed nearly . McVeigh added more explosives to the driver's side of the cargo bay, which he could ignite (killing himself in the process) at close range with his Glock 21 pistol in case the primary fuses failed. During McVeigh's trial, Lori Fortier (the wife of Michael Fortier) stated that McVeigh claimed to have arranged the barrels in order to form a shaped charge. This was achieved by tamping the aluminum side panel of the truck with bags of ammonium nitrate fertilizer to direct the blast laterally towards the building. Specifically, McVeigh arranged the barrels in the shape of a backwards J; he later said that for pure destructive power, he would have put the barrels on the side of the cargo bay closest to the Murrah Building; however, such an unevenly distributed  load might have broken an axle, flipped the truck over, or at least caused it to lean to one side, which could have drawn attention. All or most of the barrels of ANNM contained metal cylinders of acetylene intended to increase the fireball and the brisance of the explosion.\n\nMcVeigh then added a dual-fuse ignition system accessible from the truck's front cab. He drilled two\u00a0holes in the cab of the truck under the seat, while two\u00a0holes were also drilled in the body of the truck. One\u00a0green cannon fuse was run through each hole into the cab. These time-delayed fuses led from the cab through plastic fish-tank tubing conduit to two sets of non-electric blasting caps which would ignite around  of the high-grade explosives that McVeigh stole from a rock quarry. The tubing was painted yellow to blend in with the truck's livery, and duct-taped in place to the wall to make it harder to disable by yanking from the outside. The fuses were set up to initiate, through shock tubes, the  of Tovex Blastrite Gel \"sausages\", which would in turn set off the configuration of barrels. Of the 13\u00a0filled barrels, nine contained ammonium nitrate and nitromethane, and four contained a mixture of the fertilizer and about  of diesel fuel. Additional materials and tools used for manufacturing the bomb were left in the truck to be destroyed in the blast. After finishing the truck bomb, the two\u00a0men separated; Nichols returned home to Herington and McVeigh traveled with the truck to Junction City. The bomb cost about $5000 to make.\n\n==Bombing==\n\nMcVeigh's original plan had been to detonate the bomb at 11:00\u00a0am, but at dawn on April 19, 1995, he decided instead to destroy the building at 9:00\u00a0am. As he drove toward the Murrah Federal Building in the Ryder truck, McVeigh carried with him an envelope containing pages from The Turner Diaries\u00a0\u2013 a fictional account of white supremacists who ignite a revolution by blowing up the FBI headquarters at 9:15 one morning using a truck bomb. McVeigh wore a printed T-shirt with the motto of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Sic semper tyrannis (\"Thus always to tyrants\", according to legend what Brutus said as he assassinated Julius Caesar, also claimed to have been done by John Wilkes Booth immediately after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln) and \"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants\" (from Thomas Jefferson). He also carried an envelope full of revolutionary materials that included a bumper sticker with the slogan, falsely attributed to Thomas Jefferson, \"When the government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.\" Underneath, McVeigh had written, \"Maybe now, there will be liberty!\" with a hand-copied quote by John Locke asserting that a man has a right to kill someone who takes away his liberty.\n\nMcVeigh entered Oklahoma City at 8:50\u00a0am. At 8:57\u00a0am, the Regency Towers Apartments' lobby security camera that had recorded Nichols's pickup truck three days earlier recorded the Ryder truck heading towards the Murrah Federal Building. At the same moment, McVeigh lit the five-minute fuse. Three minutes later, still a block away, he lit the two-minute fuse. He parked the Ryder truck in a drop-off zone situated under the building's day-care center, exited and locked the truck. As he headed to his getaway vehicle, he dropped the keys to the truck a few blocks away.\n\n\n\nAt 9:02\u00a0a.m. (14:02 UTC), the Ryder truck, containing over  of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, nitromethane, and diesel fuel mixture, detonated in front of the north side of the nine-story Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. 168 people were killed and hundreds more injured. One third of the building was destroyed by the explosion, which created a ,  crater on NW 5th Street next to the building. The blast destroyed or damaged 324\u00a0buildings within a 4-block radius, and shattered glass in 258\u00a0nearby buildings. The broken glass alone accounted for 5\u00a0percent of the death total and 69\u00a0percent of the injuries outside the Murrah Federal Building. The blast destroyed or burned 86\u00a0cars around the site. The destruction of the buildings left several hundred people homeless and shut down a number of offices in downtown Oklahoma City. The explosion was estimated to have caused at least $652\u00a0million worth of damage.\n\nThe effects of the blast were equivalent to over  of TNT, and could be heard and felt up to  away. Seismometers at the Omniplex Science Museum in Oklahoma City,  away, and in Norman, Oklahoma,  away, recorded the blast as measuring approximately 3.0 on the Richter magnitude scale.\n\nThe collapse took roughly 7 seconds. As the truck exploded, it first destroyed the column next to it, designated as G20, and shattered the entire glass facade of the building. The shockwave of the explosion forced the lower floors upwards, before the fourth and fifth floors collapsed onto the third floor, which housed a transfer beam that ran the length of the building and was being supported by four pillars below and was supporting the pillars that hold the upper floors. The added weight meant that the third floor gave way along with the transfer beam, which in turn caused the total collapse of the building.\n\n==Arrests==\nInitially, the FBI had three hypotheses about responsibility for the bombing: international terrorists, possibly the same group that had carried out the World Trade Center bombing; a drug cartel, carrying out an act of vengeance against DEA agents in the building's DEA office; and anti-government radicals attempting to start a rebellion against the federal government.\n\n\nMcVeigh was arrested within 90\u00a0minutes of the explosion, as he was traveling north on Interstate 35 near Perry in Noble County, Oklahoma. Oklahoma State Trooper Charlie Hanger stopped McVeigh for driving his yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis without a license plate, and arrested him for having a concealed weapon. For his home address, McVeigh falsely claimed he resided at Terry Nichols's brother James's house in Michigan. After booking McVeigh into jail, Trooper Hanger searched his patrol car and found a business card which had been concealed by McVeigh after being handcuffed. Written on the back of the card, which was from a Wisconsin military surplus store, were the words \"TNT at $5 a stick. Need more.\" The card was later used as evidence during McVeigh's trial.\n\nWhile investigating the VIN from an axle of the truck used in the explosion and the remnants of the license plate, federal agents were able to link the truck to a specific Ryder rental agency in Junction City, Kansas. Using a sketch created with the assistance of Eldon Elliot, owner of the agency, the agents were able to implicate McVeigh in the bombing. McVeigh was also identified by Lea McGown of the Dreamland Motel, who remembered him parking a large yellow Ryder truck in the lot; McVeigh had signed in under his real name at the motel, using an address that matched the one on his forged license and the charge sheet at the Perry Police Station. Before signing his real name at the motel, McVeigh had used false names for his transactions. However, McGown noted, \"People are so used to signing their own name that when they go to sign a phony name, they almost always go to write, and then look up for a moment as if to remember the new name they want to use. That's what [McVeigh] did, and when he looked up I started talking to him, and it threw him.\"\n\n\nAfter an April 21, 1995, court hearing on the gun charges, but before McVeigh's release, federal agents took him into custody as they continued their investigation into the bombing. Rather than talk to investigators about the bombing, McVeigh demanded an attorney. Having been tipped off by the arrival of police and helicopters that a bombing suspect was inside, a restless crowd began to gather outside the jail. While McVeigh's requests for a bulletproof vest or transport by helicopter were denied, authorities did use a helicopter to transport him from Perry to Oklahoma City.\n\nFederal agents obtained a warrant to search the house of McVeigh's father, Bill, after which they broke down the door and wired the house and telephone with listening devices. FBI investigators used the resulting information gained, along with the fake address McVeigh had been using, to begin their search for the Nichols brothers, Terry and James. On April 21, 1995, Terry Nichols learned that he was being hunted, and turned himself in. Investigators discovered incriminating evidence at his home: ammonium nitrate and blasting caps, the electric drill used to drill out the locks at the quarry, books on bomb-making, a copy of Hunter (a 1989 novel by William Luther Pierce, the founder and chairman of the National Alliance, a white nationalist group) and a hand-drawn map of downtown Oklahoma City, on which the Murrah Building and the spot where McVeigh's getaway car was hidden were marked. After a nine-hour interrogation, Terry Nichols was formally held in federal custody until his trial. On April 25, 1995, James Nichols was also arrested, but he was released after 32\u00a0days due to lack of evidence. McVeigh's sister Jennifer was accused of illegally mailing bullets to McVeigh, but she was granted immunity in exchange for testifying against him.\n\nA Jordanian-American man traveling from his home in Oklahoma City to visit family in Jordan on April 19, 1995, was also arrested, amid concern that Middle Eastern terrorists could have been behind the attack. Further investigation cleared the man of any involvement in the bombing.\n\n==Casualties==\n\nAn estimated 646\u00a0people were inside the building when the bomb exploded. By the end of the day, 14 adults and 6 children were confirmed dead, and over 100 injured. The toll eventually reached 168\u00a0confirmed dead, not including an unmatched left leg that could have belonged to an unidentified 169th victim or could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg. Most of the deaths resulted from the collapse of the building, rather than the bomb blast itself. Those killed included 163 who were in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, one person in the Athenian Building, one woman in a parking lot across the street, a man and woman in the Oklahoma Water Resources building, and a rescue worker struck on the head by debris.\n\nThe victims, including three pregnant women, ranged in age from three months to 73 years. Of the dead, 108 worked for the Federal government: Drug Enforcement Administration (5); Secret Service (6); Department of Housing and Urban Development (35); Department of Agriculture (7); Customs Office (2); Department of Transportation\/Federal Highway (11); General Services Administration (2); and the Social Security Administration (40). Eight of the federal government victims were federal law enforcement agents. Of those law enforcement agents, four were members of the U.S. Secret Service, two were members of the U.S. Customs Service, one was a member of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and one was a member of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Six of the victims were U.S. military personnel; two members of the U.S. Army, two members of the U.S. Air Force, and two members of the U.S. Marine Corps. The rest of the victims were civilians, including 19 children, of whom 15 were in the America's Kids Day Care Center. The bodies of the 168\u00a0victims were identified at a temporary morgue set up at the scene. A team of 24 identified the victims using full-body X-rays, dental examinations, fingerprinting, blood tests, and DNA testing. More than 680 people were injured. The majority of the injuries were abrasions, severe burns, and bone fractures.\n\nMcVeigh's later response to the range of casualties was: \"I didn't define the rules of engagement in this conflict. The rules, if not written down, are defined by the aggressor. It was brutal, no holds barred. Women and kids were killed at Waco and Ruby Ridge. You put back in [the government's] faces exactly what they're giving out.\" He later stated \"I wanted the government to hurt like the people of Waco and Ruby Ridge had.\"\n\n==Response and relief==\n\n===Rescue efforts===\n\nAt 9:03\u00a0am, the first of over 1,800\u00a09-1-1 calls related to the bombing was received by Emergency Medical Services Authority (EMSA). By that time, EMSA ambulances, police, and firefighters had heard the blast and were already headed to the scene. Nearby civilians, who had also witnessed or heard the blast, arrived to assist the victims and emergency workers. Within 23\u00a0minutes of the bombing, the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) was set up, consisting of representatives from the state departments of public safety, human services, military, health, and education. Assisting the SEOC were agencies including the National Weather Service, the Air Force, the Civil Air Patrol, and the American Red Cross. Immediate assistance also came from 465\u00a0members of the Oklahoma National Guard, who arrived within the hour to provide security, and from members of the Department of Civil Emergency Management. Terrance Yeakey and  Jim Ramsey, from the Oklahoma City Police Department, were among the first officers to arrive at the site. Several cast and crew members filming for the 1996 movie Twister paused filming to come help with recovery efforts.\n\nThe EMS command post was set up almost immediately following the attack and oversaw triage, treatment, transportation, and decontamination. A simple plan\/objective was established: treatment and transportation of the injured was to be done as quickly as possible, supplies and personnel to handle a large number of patients was needed immediately, the dead needed to be moved to a temporary morgue until they could be transferred to the coroner's office, and measures for a long-term medical operation needed to be established. The triage center was set up near the Murrah Building and all the wounded were directed there. Two hundred and ten patients were transported from the primary triage center to nearby hospitals within the first couple hours following the bombing.\n\nWithin the first hour, 50\u00a0people were rescued from the Murrah Federal Building. Victims were sent to every hospital in the area. The day of the bombing, 153 people were treated at St. Anthony Hospital, eight blocks from the blast, over 70 people were treated at Presbyterian Hospital, 41 people were treated at University Hospital, and 18 people were treated at Children's Hospital. Temporary silences were observed at the blast site so that sensitive listening devices capable of detecting human heartbeats could be used to locate survivors. In some cases, limbs had to be amputated without anesthetics (avoided because of the potential to induce coma) in order to free those trapped under rubble. The scene had to be periodically evacuated as the police received tips claiming that other bombs had been planted in the building.\n\nAt 10:28\u00a0am, rescuers found what they believed to be a second bomb. Some rescue workers refused to leave until police ordered the mandatory evacuation of a four-block area around the site. The device was determined to be a three-foot (.9-m) long TOW missile used in the training of federal agents and bomb-sniffing dogs; although actually inert, it had been marked \"live\" in order to mislead arms traffickers in a planned law enforcement sting. On examination the missile was determined to be inert, and relief efforts resumed 45\u00a0minutes later. The last survivor, a 15-year-old girl found under the base of the collapsed building, was rescued at around 7\u00a0pm.\n\nIn the days following the blast, over 12,000\u00a0people participated in relief and rescue operations. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated 11 of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, bringing in 665\u00a0rescue workers. One nurse was killed in the rescue attempt after she was hit on the head by debris, and 26\u00a0other rescuers were hospitalized because of various injuries. Twenty-four K-9 units and out-of-state dogs were brought in to search for survivors and bodies in the building debris. In an effort to recover additional bodies,  of rubble were removed from the site each day from April 24 to 29.\n\n\nRescue and recovery efforts were concluded at 12:05\u00a0a.m. on May 5, by which time the bodies of all but three of the victims had been recovered. For safety reasons, the building was initially slated to be demolished shortly afterward. McVeigh's attorney, Stephen Jones, filed a motion to delay the demolition until the defense team could examine the site in preparation for the trial. At 7:02\u00a0a.m. on May 23, more than a month after the bombing, the Murrah Federal building was demolished. The EMS Command Center remained active and was staffed 24 hours a day until the demolition of the Federal Murrah Building. The final three bodies to be recovered were those of two credit union employees and a customer. For several days after the building's demolition, trucks hauled away  of debris a day from the site. Some of the debris was used as evidence in the conspirators' trials, incorporated into memorials, donated to local schools, or sold to raise funds for relief efforts.\n\n===Humanitarian aid===\nThe national humanitarian response was immediate, and in some cases even overwhelming. Large numbers of items such as wheelbarrows, bottled water, helmet lights, knee pads, rain gear, and even football helmets were donated. The sheer quantity of such donations caused logistical and inventory control problems until drop-off centers were set up to accept and sort the goods. The Oklahoma Restaurant Association, which was holding a trade show in the city, assisted rescue workers by providing 15,000 to 20,000\u00a0meals over a ten-day period.\n\nThe Salvation Army served over 100,000\u00a0meals and provided over 100,000\u00a0ponchos, gloves, hard hats, and knee pads to rescue workers. Local residents and those from further afield responded to the requests for blood donations. Of the over 9,000\u00a0units of blood donated 131\u00a0units were used; the rest were stored in blood banks.\n\n===Federal and state government aid===\n\nAt 9:45\u00a0am, Governor Frank Keating declared a state of emergency and ordered all non-essential workers in the Oklahoma City area to be released from their duties for their safety. President Bill Clinton learned about the bombing at around 9:30\u00a0a.m. while he was meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu \u00c7iller at the White House. Before addressing the nation, President Clinton considered grounding all planes in the Oklahoma City area to prevent the bombers from escaping by air, but decided against it. At 4:00\u00a0pm, President Clinton declared a federal emergency in Oklahoma City and spoke to the nation:\n\n\n\nHe ordered that flags for all federal buildings be flown at half-staff for 30\u00a0days in remembrance of the victims. Four days later, on April 23, 1995, Clinton spoke from Oklahoma City.\n\nNo major federal financial assistance was made available to the survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing, but the Murrah Fund set up in the wake of the bombing attracted over $300,000 in federal grants. Over $40\u00a0million was donated to the city to aid disaster relief and to compensate the victims. Funds were initially distributed to families who needed it to get back on their feet, and the rest was held in trust for longer-term medical and psychological needs. By 2005, $18\u00a0million of the donations remained, some of which was earmarked to provide a college education for each of the 219\u00a0children who lost one or both parents in the bombing. A committee chaired by Daniel Kurtenbach of Goodwill Industries provided financial assistance to the survivors.\n\n===International reaction===\nInternational reactions to the bombing varied. President Clinton received many messages of sympathy, including those from Queen Elizabeth\u00a0II of the United Kingdom, Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and Narasimha Rao of India. Iran condemned the bombing as an attack on innocent people, but also blamed the U.S. government's policies for inciting it. Other condolences came from Russia, Canada, Australia, the United Nations, and the European Union, among other nations and organizations.\n\nSeveral countries offered to assist in both the rescue efforts and the investigation. France offered to send a special rescue unit, and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin offered to send agents with anti-terrorist expertise to help in the investigation. President Clinton declined Israel's offer, believing that accepting it would increase anti-Muslim sentiments and endanger Muslim-Americans.\n\n===Children affected===\n\nIn the wake of the bombing, the national media focused on the fact that 19 of the victims had been babies and children, many in the day-care center. At the time of the bombing, there were 100\u00a0day-care centers in the United States in 7,900\u00a0federal buildings. McVeigh later stated that he was unaware of the day-care center when choosing the building as a target, and if he had known \"...\u00a0it might have given me pause to switch targets. That's a large amount of collateral damage.\" The FBI stated that McVeigh scouted the interior of the building in December 1994 and likely knew of the day-care center before the bombing. In April 2010, Joseph Hartzler, the prosecutor at McVeigh's trial, questioned how he could have decided to pass over a prior target building because of an included florist shop but at the Murrah building not \"...\u00a0notice that there's a child day-care center there, that there was a credit union there and a Social Security office?\"\n\nSchools across the country were dismissed early and ordered closed. A photograph of firefighter Chris Fields emerging from the rubble with infant Baylee Almon, who later died in a nearby hospital, was reprinted worldwide and became a symbol of the attack. The photo, taken by bank employee Charles H. Porter\u00a0IV, won the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography and appeared on newspapers and magazines for months following the attack.\nAren Almon Kok, mother of Baylee Almon, said of the photo: \"It was very hard to go to stores because they are in the check out aisle. It was always there. It was devastating. Everybody had seen my daughter dead. And that's all she became to them. She was a symbol. She was the girl in the fireman's arms. But she was a real person that got left behind.\"\n\nThe images and media reports of children dying terrorized many children who, as demonstrated by later research, showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Children became a primary focus of concern in the mental health response to bombing and many bomb related services were delivered to the community, young and old alike. These services were delivered to public schools of Oklahoma and reached approximately 40,000 students. One of the first organized mental health activities in Oklahoma City was a clinical study of middle and high school students conducted 7 weeks after the bombing. The study focused on middle and high school students who had no connection or relation to the victims of the bombing. This study showed that these students, although deeply moved by the event and showing a sense of vulnerability on the matter, had no difficulty with the demands of school or home life, contrasting those who were connected to the bombing and its victims, who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nChildren were also affected through the loss of parents in the bombing. Many children lost one or more parents in the blast, with a reported seven children who lost their only remaining parent. Children of the disaster have been raised by single parents, foster parents, and other family members. Adjusting to the loss has made these children suffer psychologically and emotionally. One interview revealed the sleepless nights and obsession with death of one of the at least ten orphaned children.\n\nPresident Clinton stated that after seeing images of babies being pulled from the wreckage, he was \"beyond angry\" and wanted to \"put [his] fist through the television\". Clinton and his wife Hillary requested that aides talk to child care specialists about how to communicate with the children regarding the bombing. President Clinton spoke to the nation three days after the bombing, saying: \"I don't want our children to believe something terrible about life and the future and grownups in general because of this awful thing\u00a0... most adults are good people who want to protect our children in their childhood and we are going to get through this\". On April 22, 1995, the Clintons spoke in the White House with over 40\u00a0federal agency employees and their children, and in a live nationwide television and radio broadcast, addressed their concerns.\n\n===Media coverage===\nHundreds of news trucks and members of the press arrived at the site to cover the story. The press immediately noticed that the bombing took place on the second anniversary of the Waco incident. \n\nMany initial news stories hypothesized the attack had been undertaken by Islamic terrorists, such as those who had masterminded the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Some media reported that investigators wanted to question men of Middle Eastern appearance. Hamzi Moghrabi, chairman of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, blamed the media for harassment of Muslims and Arabs that took place after the bombing.\n\nAs the rescue effort wound down, the media interest shifted to the investigation, arrests, and trials of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, and on the search for an additional suspect named \"John Doe Number Two.\" Several witnesses claimed to have seen a second suspect, who did not resemble Nichols, with McVeigh.\n\nThose who expressed sympathy for McVeigh typically described his deed as an act of war, as in the case of Gore Vidal's essay The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh.\n\n==Trials and sentencing of the conspirators==\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) led the official investigation, known as OKBOMB, with Weldon L. Kennedy acting as special agent in charge. Kennedy oversaw 900\u00a0federal, state, and local law enforcement personnel including 300\u00a0FBI agents, 200\u00a0officers from the Oklahoma City Police Department, 125\u00a0members of the Oklahoma National Guard, and 55\u00a0officers from the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety. The crime task force was deemed the largest since the investigation into the assassination of John F. Kennedy. OKBOMB was the largest criminal case in America's history, with FBI agents conducting 28,000\u00a0interviews, amassing  of evidence, and collecting nearly one billion\u00a0pieces of information. Federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ordered that the venue for the trial be moved from Oklahoma City to Denver, Colorado, citing that the defendants would be unable to receive a fair trial in Oklahoma. The investigation led to the separate trials and convictions of McVeigh, Nichols, and Fortier.\n\n===Timothy McVeigh===\n\nOpening statements in McVeigh's trial began on April 24, 1997. The United States was represented by a team of prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler. In his opening statement Hartzler outlined McVeigh's motivations, and the evidence against him. McVeigh, he said, had developed a hatred of the government during his time in the army, after reading The Turner Diaries. His beliefs were supported by what he saw as the militia's ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of the Brady Bill, and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents. The prosecution called 137\u00a0witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh's sister, Jennifer McVeigh, all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh's hatred of the government and his desire to take militant action against it. Both Fortiers testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Michael revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date, and Lori testified that she created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck.\n\nMcVeigh was represented by a defense counsel team of six principal attorneys led by Stephen Jones. According to law professor Douglas O. Linder, McVeigh wanted Jones to present a \"necessity defense\"\u00a0\u2013 which would argue that he was in \"imminent danger\" from the government (that his bombing was intended to prevent future crimes by the government, such as the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents). McVeigh argued that \"imminent\" does not mean \"immediate\": \"If a comet is hurtling toward the earth, and it's out past the orbit of Pluto, it's not an immediate threat to Earth, but it is an imminent threat.\" Despite McVeigh's wishes, Jones attempted to discredit the prosecution's case in an attempt to instill reasonable doubt. Jones also believed that McVeigh was part of a larger conspiracy, and sought to present him as \"the designated patsy\", but McVeigh disagreed with Jones arguing that rationale for his defense. After a hearing, Judge Matsch independently ruled the evidence concerning a larger conspiracy to be too insubstantial to be admissible. In addition to arguing that the bombing could not have been carried out by two men alone, Jones also attempted to create reasonable doubt by arguing that no one had seen McVeigh near the scene of the crime, and that the investigation into the bombing had lasted only two weeks. Jones presented 25\u00a0witnesses over a one-week period, including  Frederic Whitehurst. Although Whitehurst described the FBI's sloppy investigation of the bombing site and its handling of other key evidence, he was unable to point to any direct evidence that he knew to be contaminated.\n\nA key point of contention in the case was the unmatched left leg found after the bombing. Although it was initially believed to be from a male, it was later determined to be that of Lakesha Levy, a female member of the Air Force who was killed in the bombing. Levy's coffin had to be re-opened so that her leg could replace another unmatched leg that had previously been buried with her remains. The unmatched leg had been embalmed, which prevented authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine the leg's owner. Jones argued that the leg could have belonged to another bomber, possibly John Doe No. 2. The prosecution disputed the claim, saying that the leg could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg.\n\nNumerous damaging leaks, which appeared to originate from conversations between McVeigh and his defense attorneys, emerged. They included a confession said to have been inadvertently included on a computer disk that was given to the press, which McVeigh believed seriously compromised his chances of getting a fair trial. A gag order was imposed during the trial, prohibiting attorneys on either side from commenting to the press on the evidence, proceedings, or opinions regarding the trial proceedings. The defense was allowed to enter into evidence six pages of a 517-page Justice Department report criticizing the FBI crime laboratory and David Williams, one of the agency's explosives experts, for reaching unscientific and biased conclusions. The report claimed that Williams had worked backward in the investigation rather than basing his determinations on forensic evidence.\n\nThe jury deliberated for 23\u00a0hours. On June 2, 1997, McVeigh was found guilty on 11\u00a0counts of murder and conspiracy. Although the defense argued for a reduced sentence of life imprisonment, McVeigh was sentenced to death. In May 2001, the Justice Department announced that the FBI had mistakenly failed to provide over 3,000\u00a0documents to McVeigh's defense counsel. The Justice Department also announced that the execution would be postponed for one month for the defense to review the documents. On June 6, federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ruled the documents would not prove McVeigh innocent and ordered the execution to proceed. McVeigh invited conductor David Woodard to perform pre-requiem Mass music on the eve of his execution; while reproachful of McVeigh's capital wrongdoing, Woodard consented. After President George W. Bush approved the execution (McVeigh was a federal inmate and federal law dictates that the president must approve the execution of federal prisoners), he was executed by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute in Terre Haute, Indiana, on June 11, 2001. The execution was transmitted on closed-circuit television so that the relatives of the victims could witness his death. McVeigh's execution was the first federal execution in 38\u00a0years.\n\n===Terry Nichols===\n\nNichols stood trial twice. He was first tried by the federal government in 1997 and found guilty of conspiring to build a weapon of mass destruction and of eight counts of involuntary manslaughter of federal officers. After he was sentenced on June 4, 1998 to life without parole, the State of Oklahoma in 2000 sought a death-penalty conviction on 161\u00a0counts of first-degree murder (160\u00a0non-federal agent victims and one\u00a0fetus). On May 26, 2004 the jury found him guilty on all charges, but deadlocked on the issue of sentencing him to death. Presiding Judge Steven W. Taylor then determined the sentence of 161\u00a0consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole. In March 2005, FBI investigators, acting on a tip, searched a buried crawl space in Nichols's former house and found additional explosives missed in the preliminary search after Nichols was arrested.\n\n===Michael and Lori Fortier===\nMichael and Lori Fortier were considered accomplices for their foreknowledge of the planning of the bombing. In addition to Michael assisting McVeigh in scouting the federal building, Lori had helped McVeigh laminate a fake driver's license which was later used to rent the Ryder truck. Michael agreed to testify against McVeigh and Nichols in exchange for a reduced sentence and immunity for his wife. He was sentenced on May 27, 1998 to 12\u00a0years in prison and fined $75,000 for failing to warn authorities about the attack. On January 20, 2006, after serving ten and a half years of his sentence, including time already served, Fortier was released for good behavior into the Witness Protection Program and given a new identity.\n\n===Others===\nNo \"John Doe #2\" was ever identified, nothing conclusive was ever reported regarding the owner of the unmatched leg, and the government never openly investigated anyone else in conjunction with the bombing. Although the defense teams in both McVeigh's and Nichols's trials suggested that others were involved, Judge Steven W. Taylor found no credible, relevant, or legally admissible evidence, of anyone other than McVeigh and Nichols having directly participated in the bombing. When McVeigh was asked if there were other conspirators in the bombing, he replied: \"You can't handle the truth! Because the truth is, I blew up the Murrah Building, and isn't it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell?\" On the morning of McVeigh's execution a letter was released in which he had written \"For those die-hard conspiracy theorists who will refuse to believe this, I turn the tables and say: Show me where I needed anyone else. Financing? Logistics? Specialized tech skills? Brainpower? Strategy? ... Show me where I needed a dark, mysterious 'Mr. X'!\"\n\n==Aftermath==\nWithin 48\u00a0hours of the attack, and with the assistance of the General Services Administration (GSA), the targeted federal offices were able to resume operations in other parts of the city. According to Mark Potok, director of Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, his organization tracked another 60\u00a0domestic smaller-scale terrorism plots from 1995 to 2005. Several of the plots were uncovered and prevented while others caused various infrastructure damage, deaths, or other destruction. Potok revealed that in 1996 there were approximately 858\u00a0domestic militias and other antigovernment groups but the number had dropped to 152 by 2004. Shortly after the bombing, the FBI hired an additional 500\u00a0agents to investigate potential domestic terrorist attacks.\n\n===Legislation===\nIn the wake of the bombing the U.S. government enacted several pieces of legislation including the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. In response to the trials of the conspirators being moved out-of-state, the Victim Allocution Clarification Act of 1997 was signed on March 20, 1997 by President Clinton to allow the victims of the bombing (and the victims of any other future acts of violence) the right to observe trials and to offer impact testimony in sentencing hearings. In response to passing the legislation, Clinton stated that \"when someone is a victim, he or she should be at the center of the criminal justice process, not on the outside looking in.\"\n\nIn the years since the bombing, scientists, security experts, and the ATF have called on Congress to develop legislation that would require customers to produce identification when purchasing ammonium nitrate fertilizer, and for sellers to maintain records of its sale. Critics argue that farmers lawfully use large quantities of the fertilizer, and as of 2009, only Nevada and South Carolina require identification from purchasers. In June 1995, Congress enacted legislation requiring chemical taggants to be incorporated into dynamite and other explosives so that a bomb could be traced to its manufacturer. In 2008, Honeywell announced that it had developed a nitrogen-based fertilizer that would not detonate when mixed with fuel oil. The company got assistance from the Department of Homeland Security to develop the fertilizer (Sulf-N 26) for commercial use. It uses ammonium sulfate to make the fertilizer less explosive.\n\n====Oklahoma School Curriculum====\nIn the decade following the bombing, there was criticism of Oklahoma public schools for not requiring the bombing to be covered in the curriculum of mandatory Oklahoma history classes. Oklahoma History is a one-semester course required by state law for graduation from high school; however, the bombing was only covered for one to two pages at most in textbooks. The state's PASS standards (Priority Academic Student Skills) did not require that a student learn about the bombing, and focused more on other subjects such as corruption and the Dust Bowl. On April 6, 2010, House Bill 2750 was signed by Governor Brad Henry, requiring the bombing to be entered into the school curriculum for Oklahoma, U.S. and world history classes.\n\nOn the signing, Governor Henry said \"Although the events of April 19, 1995 may be etched in our minds and in the minds of Oklahomans who remember that day, we have a generation of Oklahomans that has little to no memory of the events of that day ... We owe it to the victims, the survivors and all of the people touched by this tragic event to remember April 19, 1995 and understand what it meant and still means to this state and this nation.\"\n\n===Building security and construction===\n\nIn the weeks following the bombing the federal government ordered that all federal buildings in all major cities be surrounded with prefabricated Jersey barriers to prevent similar attacks. As part of a longer-term plan for United States federal building security most of those temporary barriers have since been replaced with permanent and more aesthetically considerate security barriers, which are driven deep into the ground for sturdiness. Furthermore, all new federal buildings must now be constructed with truck-resistant barriers and with deep setbacks from surrounding streets to minimize their vulnerability to truck bombs. FBI buildings, for instance, must be set back  from traffic. The total cost of improving security in federal buildings across the country in response to the bombing reached over $600\u00a0million.\n\nThe Murrah Federal Building had been considered so safe that it only employed one security guard. In June 1995, the DOJ issued Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities, also known as The Marshals Report, the findings of which resulted in a thorough evaluation of security at all federal buildings and a system for classifying risks at over 1,300\u00a0federal facilities owned or leased by the federal government. Federal sites were divided into five security levels ranging from Level 1 (minimum security needs) to Level 5 (maximum). The Alfred P. Murrah Building was deemed a Level 4 building. Among the 52\u00a0security improvements were physical barriers, closed-circuit television monitoring, site planning and access, hardening of building exteriors to increase blast resistance, glazing systems to reduce flying glass shards and fatalities, and structural engineering design to prevent progressive collapse.\n\nThe attack led to engineering improvements allowing buildings to better withstand tremendous forces, improvements which were incorporated into the design of Oklahoma City's new federal building. The National Geographic Channel documentary series Seconds From Disaster suggested that the Murrah Federal Building would probably have survived the blast had it been built according to California's earthquake design codes.\n\n===Impact according to McVeigh===\nMcVeigh believed that the bomb attack had a positive impact on government policy. In evidence he cited the peaceful resolution of the Montana Freemen standoff in 1996, the government's $3.1\u00a0million settlement with Randy Weaver and his surviving children four months after the bombing, and April 2000 statements by Bill Clinton regretting his decision to storm the Branch Davidian compound. McVeigh stated, \"Once you bloody the bully's nose, and he knows he's going to be punched again, he's not coming back around.\"\n\n===Conspiracy theories===\n\nA variety of conspiracy theories have been proposed about the events surrounding the bombing. Some theories allege that individuals in the government, including President Bill Clinton, knew of the impending bombing and intentionally failed to act. Other theories focus on initial reports by local news stations of multiple other unexploded bombs within the building itself as evidence of remnants of a controlled demolition; following the attack, search and rescue operations at the site were delayed until the area had been declared safe by the Oklahoma City bomb squad and federal authorities. According to both a situation report compiled by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and a memo issued by the United States Atlantic Command the day following the attack, a second bomb located within the building was disarmed while a third was evacuated. Further theories focus on additional conspirators involved with the bombing. Additional theories claim the bombing was carried out by the government in order to frame the militia movement or to provide the impetus for new antiterrorism legislation while using McVeigh as a scapegoat. Other conspiracy theories suggest that foreign agents, particularly Islamic terrorists but also the Japanese government or German Neo-Nazis, were involved in the bombing. Experts have disputed the theories and government investigations have been opened at various times to look into the theories.\n\n==Evacuation issues==\nOnce the explosion took place at the Alfred P. Murrah building, chaotic response filled the surrounding streets. Those who were able to flee the Murrah building did so, while others, stuck in the rubble, awaited the assistance of rescue workers and volunteers. As reported on CNN, other federal buildings in the downtown area were not fully evacuated, but those who were able to leave the city were encouraged to do so. This traffic, along with the people leaving places around the Murrah Building clogged streets, delaying the arrival of rescue crews and relief agencies.\nSeveral agencies, including the Federal Highway Administration and the City of Oklahoma City have evaluated the emergency response actions to the bombing, and have proposed plans for a better response in addition to addressing issues that hindered a smooth rescue effort. Because of the crowded streets, and the number of response agencies sent to the location, communication between government branches and rescue workers was muddled. Groups were unaware of the operations others were conducting, thus creating strife and delays in the search and rescue process. The City of Oklahoma City, in their After Action Report, declared that better communication and single bases for agencies would better the aid of those in disastrous situations.\nFollowing the events of September 11, 2001, with consideration of other events including the Oklahoma City Bombing, the Federal Highway Administration proposed the idea that major metropolitan areas create evacuation routes for civilians. These highlighted routes would allow paths for emergency crews and government agencies to enter the disaster area more quickly. By helping civilians out, and rescue workers in, the number of casualties will hopefully be decreased.\n\n==Memorial observances==\n\n===Oklahoma City National Memorial===\n\nFor two\u00a0years after the bombing the only memorials to the victims were plush toys, crucifixes, letters, and other personal items left by thousands of people at a security fence surrounding the site of the building. Many suggestions for suitable memorials were sent to Oklahoma City, but an official memorial planning committee was not set up until early 1996, when the Murrah Federal Building Memorial Task Force, composed of 350\u00a0members, was set up to formulate plans for a memorial to commemorate the victims of the bombing. On July 1, 1997 the winning design was chosen unanimously by a 15-member panel from 624\u00a0submissions. The memorial was designed at a cost of $29\u00a0million, which was raised by public and private funds. The national memorial is part of the National Park System as an affiliated area and was designed by Oklahoma City architects Hans and Torrey Butzer and Sven Berg. It was dedicated by President Clinton on April 19, 2000, exactly five years after the bombing. Within the first year, it had 700,000\u00a0visitors.\n\nThe memorial includes a reflecting pool flanked by two large gates, one inscribed with the time 9:01, the other with 9:03, the pool representing the moment of the blast. On the south end of the memorial is a field of symbolic bronze and stone chairs\u00a0\u2013 one for each person lost, arranged according to what floor of the building they were on. The chairs represent the empty chairs at the dinner tables of the victims' families. The seats of the children killed are smaller than those of the adults lost. On the opposite side is the \"survivor tree\", part of the building's original landscaping that survived the blast and fires that followed it. The memorial left part of the foundation of the building intact, allowing visitors to see the scale of the destruction. Part of the chain link fence put in place around the site of the blast, which had attracted over 800,000\u00a0personal items of commemoration later collected by the Oklahoma City Memorial Foundation, is now on the western edge of the memorial. North of the memorial is the Journal Record Building, which now houses the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum, an affiliate of the National Park Service. The building also contains the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, a law enforcement training center.\n\n\n\n===St. Joseph's Old Cathedral===\nSt. Joseph's Old Cathedral, one of the first brick-and-mortar churches in the city, is located to the southwest of the memorial and was severely damaged by the blast. To commemorate the event, a statue and sculpture work entitled And Jesus Wept was installed adjacent to the Oklahoma City National Memorial. The work was dedicated in May 1997 and the church was rededicated on December 1 of the same year. The church, the statue, and the sculpture are not part of the Oklahoma City memorial.\n\n===Remembrance observance===\nAn observance is held each year to remember the victims of the bombing. An annual marathon draws thousands, and allows runners to sponsor a victim of the bombing. For the tenth anniversary of the bombing, the city held 24\u00a0days of activities, including a week-long series of events known as the National Week of Hope from April 17 to 24, 2005. As in previous years, the tenth anniversary of the bombing observances began with a service at 9:02\u00a0am, marking the moment the bomb went off, with the traditional 168\u00a0seconds of silence\u00a0\u2013 one\u00a0second for each person who was killed as a result of the blast. The service also included the traditional reading of the names, read by children to symbolize the future of Oklahoma City.\n\nVice President Dick Cheney, former President Clinton, Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry, Frank Keating, Governor of Oklahoma at the time of the bombing, and other political dignitaries attended the service and gave speeches in which they emphasized that \"goodness overcame evil\". The relatives of the victims and the survivors of the blast also made note of it during the service at First United Methodist Church in Oklahoma City.\n\nPresident George W. Bush made note of the anniversary in a written statement, part of which echoed his remarks on the execution of Timothy McVeigh in 2001: \"For the survivors of the crime and for the families of the dead the pain goes on.\" Bush was invited but did not attend the service because he was en route to Springfield, Illinois, to dedicate the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. Cheney attended the service in his place.\n\nDue to COVID-19 and 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic, the memorial site was closed to the public on April 19, 2020, and local television networks broadcast pre-recorded remembrances to mark the 25th anniversary.\n\n==See also==\n\n* List of terrorist incidents\n* Lone wolf (terrorism), a term to describe non-state actor terrorists that commit violence without any specific link to an organization.\n* 2011 Oslo bombing, lone wolf attack against government offices, using similar explosives and killing 77 people.\n* AMIA bombing\n* September 11 attacks, the deadliest instance of terrorism in the United States.\n\n==References==\n\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n\n==External links==\n\n*  Oklahoma City National Memorial official website\n*  The Denver Post: Oklahoma City Bombing Trial\n* \n*  List of victims of the bombing\n* \n*  Text, audio, and video of President Clinton's Oklahoma Bombing Memorial address\n*  Interactive timeline of the bombing events\n*  Terror Hits Home: The Oklahoma City Bombing from the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n*  The Oklahoma City Bombing 20 Years Later from the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n*  Voices of Oklahoma interview with Stephen Jones.

{"title":"1995 France bombings","article":"-->\n}} \nThe 1995 France bombings were a series of attacks that targeted public transport systems in Paris and Lyon Metropolis, as well as a school in Villeurbanne. They were carried out by the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), who were broadening the Algerian Civil War to France. The attacks killed eight people, all during the first attack on July 25th. The attack also injured about 157.\n\nThe assassination of Abdelbaki Sahraoui, a co-founder of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was a prelude to the extension of the Islamists' terrorist campaign to France.\n\n==Attacks==\nOn July 25, 1995, a gas bottle exploded in the Saint-Michel station of line B of the RER. Place Saint-Michel and the surrounding bridges and streets filled with emergency vehicles. Parvis Notre-Dame became a helicopter landing site whilst a nearby caf\u00e9, Le depart Saint-Michel, was used as a field hospital. At 8pm, France 2 news announced that four people had been killed and another 40 injured in a \"mysterious explosion\". At that time, no official sources had confirmed that it was a terrorist attack. The terrorist attack was later confirmed, and the final outcome was said to be eight deaths and 117 injured. It was the deadliest terror attack in France since the 1983 Orly Airport attack, and would be the only deadly attack for the GIA's 1995 bombing campaign in France.\n\nOn August 17, a second bomb hidden in a trash can at the Arc de Triomphe wounded 16 people. The bomb was composed of a gas bottle with nails.\n\nOn August 26, a huge bomb was found on the railroad tracks of a high-speed rail line near Lyon. It was supposed to explode when a train passed. Fingerprints of Khaled Kelkal and Boualem Bensa\u00efd were found on the bomb. The leader of the group, Khaled Kelkal was quickly identified and his picture appeared all over France. Bombing attacks continued with an attack on September 3 at an open market in the 11th arrondissement of Paris, causing three injuries; and on  September 7 when a car bomb exploded near a Jewish school in Villeurbanne, a town near Lyon, causing thirteen injuries.\n\nThe wanted suspect, Khaled Kelkal, was killed on September 29 by members of the French EPIGN gendarmerie unit near Lyon as he resisted arrest. Nonetheless, the attacks continued on October 6, the day of Khaled Kelkal\u2019s funeral; another gas bottle exploded in the Maison Blanche station of the Paris M\u00e9tro, wounding twelve people. Boualem Bensa\u00efd\u2019s fingerprints were again found on the bomb. The next day, a statement from GIA commander Djamel Zitouni, written on September 23, arrived at the Reuters press agency in Cairo. He said the \"Jihad\"- the \"military strikes at the heart of France\", were intended to punish it for supporting the Algerian government. A letter was also sent to Jacques Chirac through the French Embassy in Algiers, urging him to convert to Islam.\n\nOn October 17, a gas bottle exploded between the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay and Saint-Michel\u2013Notre-Dame stations of RER Line C, wounding 29. Investigators found a transportation card on Sma\u00efn A\u00eft Ali Belkacem used a few minutes before the attack in a nearby subway station.\n\nAdditional bombs were found and cleared without casualties during morning searches of Metro and RER stations, often in restrooms. Increased security mandated the removal of all public trash cans, to prevent bombs from being hidden within.\n\n== Arrests and trials ==\nMembers of the Armed Islamic Group and the \"Kelkal Group\" have since been prosecuted on various charges. Some suspects fled to the United Kingdom. Extradition proceedings against Rachid Ramda began in 1995 and went on for nearly ten years, during which Ramda remained detained in London's Belmarsh Prison. Ramda was eventually extradited to France on December 1, 2005 in connection with the bombings. On October 26, 2007, Ramda was sentenced to life in prison for financing the attacks.\n\nAccording to FBI terrorism consultant Evan Kohlmann, part of the money used to finance the bombings came from people connected to the Brandbergen Mosque in Haninge, Sweden.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAlgeria-France relations were heavily affected by these events. Chirac refused to welcome the Algerian ministers, openly saying that the GIA could have been manipulated by the Algerian secret services.\n\nLegislation on terrorism in France was reinforced with a new law in 1996 allowing police forces to perform searches at night. Paris also suspended the Schengen Acquis and did not lift the border controls until March 1996.\n\nVigipirate, activated in September 1995, is still in place in 2020. The crisis lessened when Lionel Jospin became prime minister in 1997 and Abdelaziz Bouteflika became the new Algerian president.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* Boualem Bensaid\n* Khaled Kelkal\n* Rachid Ramda\n* Djamel Zitouni\n* Transit police\n* List of terrorist incidents in France\n* 1996 Paris RER bombing\n* Air France Flight 8969\n\n==Notes and references==","urls":["http:\/\/www.liberation.fr\/actualite\/reuters\/reuters_france\/281817.FR.php","https:\/\/books.google.com\/?id=vh8xDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT96&lpg=PT96&dq=lyon+bombing+1995+Villeurbanne","https:\/\/www.liberation.fr\/france\/1995\/10\/03\/la-bande-son-de-la-fin-de-khaled-kelkal_148064","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/uk\/4489626.stm","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-dyn\/content\/article\/2007\/10\/26\/AR2007102601425.html","http:\/\/aftonbladet.se\/vss\/nyheter\/story\/0,2789,672257,00.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20061206204232\/http:\/\/www.aftonbladet.se\/vss\/nyheter\/story\/0%2C2789%2C672257%2C00.html","http:\/\/www.lemonde.fr,","http:\/\/www.lefigaro.fr,"]}

The bomb was estimated to have contained  of home-made explosive. The blast slightly injured 17 people. It left a crater  wide in the car park and destroyed at least a dozen cars. The hotel received two bomb warnings at 11.40 p.m. The warning stated that a silver grey Isuzu jeep with the registration number 92RN92 contained a bomb and was parked in the hotel car park.\n\nThe attendants at the wedding blamed the group for ending the wedding on what they called a terrible note.\n\n==Precursor events and reaction==\nA silver Isuzu Trooper jeep was stolen in Dublin on 3 July. On 4 July it was stopped at a Garda Siochana checkpoint at midnight near Redhills in County Cavan. The driver was asked for insurance and identification and drove off quickly.\n\nThe RUC were warned to watch out for the jeep. Three days later the RUC spotted it near Newtownbutler in Fermanagh.

{"title":"Aldwych bus bombing","article":"The Aldwych bus bombing occurred on 18 February 1996 when an improvised explosive device being carried by Irish republican Edward O'Brien detonated prematurely on a number 171 bus in Aldwych, in the West End of London. The 2\u00a0kg semtex bomb detonated as he sat near the door of the bus. \n\nThe bomb killed O'Brien instantly and injured people both inside and outside the bus, including the driver, Bob Newitt, who became permanently deaf. The victims were brought to St Thomas's Hospital and University College Hospital. Three of them were in two cars in front of the bus at the time. The blast could be heard from 5 miles away. Police said they received no warning about the bomb. The incident also forced the closure of Charing Cross railway station.\n\n==Background==\nThe bus bombing came just nine days after the Docklands bombing in east London, which marked the end of the IRA's ceasefire and the resumption of its armed campaign in England. On 16 February, an IRA bomb planted in a telephone box on Charing Cross Road, near Leicester Square tube station, was destroyed by a police remote controlled robot after a telephone warning.\n\n==Investigation==\nIt was initially reported by some media that three people were killed, but it then became clear that only one, the perpetrator, had died. \n\nA subsequent police search of the London address of Edward O'Brien, a Provisional IRA member, discovered 15\u00a0kg of semtex, 20 timers, 4 detonators and ammunition for a 9\u00a0mm Walther revolver, along with an incendiary device. The Walther pistol was discovered on him after his death. The police said they were also almost certain that O'Brien was the person who planted the telephone box bomb three days before the bus bombing.\n\nAnother Irishman, Brendan Woolhead, who was in the area at the time of the explosion and suffered a fractured skull, was briefly suspected and accused of involvement. His name was cleared and he subsequently won around \u00a3200,000 in damages for libel. Woolhead died in October 1996 due to drug detoxification treatment for addiction to heroin.\n\n==Bus==\nThe destroyed bus was a Leyland Titan double-decker bus - fleet number T990, registration WLT\u00a0990, originally registered as A990\u00a0SYE in 1984 - operated by London Central and travelling its route from Catford to Holborn. The bus had travelled across Waterloo Bridge and just passed Somerset House and the Strand intersection when the explosion happened.\n\n==See also==\n*Docklands bombing\n*1996 Hammersmith Bridge bombing\n*7 July 2005 London bombings\n*Provisional Irish Republican Army campaign 1969\u20131997\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/onthisday\/hi\/dates\/stories\/february\/18\/newsid_4165000\/4165719.stm","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/onthisday\/hi\/dates\/stories\/february\/18\/newsid_4165000\/4165719.stm","http:\/\/www.anphoblacht.com\/news\/detail\/17956","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1996\/02\/16\/world\/ira-bomb-destroyed-in-central-london.html","https:\/\/gulfnews.com\/opinion\/today-in-history\/february-18-1996-ira-bomb-on-london-bus-kills-three-1.1674764","https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/dead-ira-man-had-hit-list-of-bomb-targets-1305236.html","http:\/\/www.independent.ie\/irish-news\/doctor-linked-to-drug-detox-death-danger-to-the-public-26071349.html","http:\/\/www.countrybus.org\/Titan\/TNa.htm"]}

{"title":"Philippine consulate bombing in Jakarta","article":"The Philippine consulate bombing of Jakarta occurred on 1 August 2000 in Menteng, Jakarta, Indonesia. A bomb was detonated outside the official residence of the Philippine ambassador to Indonesia, Leonides Caday, killing two people and injuring 21 others. Those killed were a female street vendor and a guard to the official residence. Caday was treated in hospital for head and hand injuries.\n\n==The explosion==\nSome witnesses suggested the 12:30 p.m. blast came from the envoy's vehicle and detonated as it entered the residence on Imam Bonjol Street. However, police investigators theorized that another car parked near the entrance contained the bomb, which was detonated as the ambassador's Mercedes entered his driveway. \n\nThe lunchtime blast caused numerous shrapnel wounds and at least four bystanders were taken to Jakarta hospitals with critical injuries. The car carrying the Philippine ambassador to Indonesia was destroyed and there was damage to dozens of other vehicles on the street that houses several government offices and the homes of other foreign diplomats and senior government officials. A wing of the official residence and the office of Indonesia's national electoral commission were both moderately damaged.\n\n==Reaction==\nIn response Alexander Aguirre, national security adviser to then President Joseph Estrada, stated the bombing was the first time a Philippine diplomatic post had been bombed and that the Philippine government \"didn't expect that to happen.\" Security at the Philippine Embassy in Jakarta, also located on Imam Bonjol Street, was tightened as a result.\n\nThen Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid stated he believed the bombing was linked to the Philippine government's efforts to combat Islamist rebel groups in Mindanao, however the Moro Islamic Liberation Front released a statement denying it had set the bomb. Abu Sayyaf, another group opposed to the Philippine government, did not claim responsibility either.\n\nAlmost three years later Indonesian police identified ten suspects, most known members of regional terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah, as suspects in the investigation. The now apprehended Riduan Isamuddin, chief organiser of the 2002 Bali nightclub bombings among others, is suspected of planning and financing the attack. \n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/news.google.com\/newspapers?id=jLQaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gUMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5314,1039977&dq=bomb+jakarta+2000&hl=en","http:\/\/www.independent.ie\/world-news\/bomb-blast-at-home-of-philippines-ambassador-to-indonesia-369102.html","http:\/\/www.bangla2000.com\/news\/archive\/international\/8-2-2000\/news_detail4.html","http:\/\/www.globalsecurity.org\/military\/library\/news\/2000\/08\/000802-phil1.htm"]}
{"title":"Shijiazhuang bombings","article":"The Shijiazhuang bombings, also known as Jin Ruchao bombings and March 16 bombings, were a series of bomb blasts that took place on March 16, 2001 in Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei province in North China. A total of 108 people were killed, and 38 others injured when within a short period of time several bombs exploded near four apartment buildings. Investigations found that Jin was motivated by hatred for his ex-wife, ex-mother-in-law and a lover; he had previously threatened to blow up their buildings.\n\n==Sequence of events==\n\n\nThe explosives were made from ammonium nitrate. Jin had paid 950 RMB ($115) to Wang Yushun and Hao Fengqin, owners of an illegal explosives workshop near Shijiazhuang.\n\nAccording to Jin Ruchao's confession, he flew to Tianjin after stabbing his girlfriend to death in her Maguan County, Yunnan home and took a bus to the suburbs of Shijiazhuang, where he hid the fuse and detonators. He then purchased dynamites from Wang Yushun, who he also bought small quantities of dynamite from last year for experiments, in Luquan District. From March 12-14, Jin bought dynamite from Wang for 3 times. On the 15th, Jin rented a pick-up truck to transport his bombs to his targets, which were in bags labeled as \"chicken feed\". For some reason, the truck driver refused to take the bags further while midway through the journey and Jin was forced to store them in an abandoned building in a village outside of the city. At 8 pm that night, he first rented a three-wheeler to transport bombs to the Hardware Company dorm on 13 Dianda Street and 12th Hutong on Minjin Street, as well as the Shijiazhuang Number 1 Construction and Number 3 Cotton Mill dorms. After a quick nap, he delivered more bombs to the latter two dorms with the help of another three-wheeler and a taxi. He then took multiple taxis to detonate the bombs one by one.\n\nThe first bomb went off at 4:16 am and blew a hole in the walls of the 15 Cotton Mill dorm, which housed Jin's step mother at the time. Shortly after, the 16 Cotton Mill dorm, where Jin lived and had a bitter argument with a neighbor regarding splitting rooms, was completely leveled by the second bomb. The third bomb when off at 4:30 am, destroying a unit of the Shijiazhuang Construction company dorm, which housed Jin's ex. At 4:45 am, a unit of the Hardware Company dorm, which housed Jin's ex, was demolished by a bomb. The final explosion came at 5:01 am, at the 12th Hutong on Minjin Street, which Jin had inherited from his parents but had lost money selling the property. Fortunately, the bomb had only made a crater on the ground nearby. \n\n==Perpetrators==\nJin Ruchao (C: \u9773\u5982\u8d85, P: J\u00ecn R\u00fach\u0101o), (December 7, 1960 - April 29, 2001) was blamed and arrested for planning and carrying out the bombings. Jin became deaf at age 8 due to an ear infection, and he since became silent and a loner. He was also subjected to constant bullying at school. He dropped out during middle school due to financial issues and worked in a textile factory among a plethora of other jobs. He had kept a diary, where he wrote that he was superstitious toward his family members, particularly toward his ex-wife, who he thought planned his rape conviction in 1988. Jin also blamed traffic accidents that killed his mother and injured his father in 1994 onto his ex-wife and her family. \n\nFollowing widespread public fear, the Chinese Government published a lengthy description of the bombings. Jin was arrested in Beihai, Guangxi following a manhunt and a posted 100,000 RMB ($12,000) reward just 11 days after the bombing, which had been doubled from an initial 50,000 RMB.\n\nAfter pleading guilty, Jin was sentenced to death and executed, along with the three who supplied Jin with about 1,300 pounds of homemade explosives. \n\n==Aftermath==\nThe attack was the biggest mass murder in China in decades. China scholar Andrew Scobell described it as perhaps the worst terrorist act in the history of the People's Republic of China. There were rumours that Jin was a scapegoat with no knowledge of explosives, and that the blast could have been orchestrated by disaffected ex-employees of who had been laid-off in China's restructuring.\n\nOn 29 April 2001, Jin Ruchao, Wang Yushun, and Hao Fengqin received the death penalty for their roles in the bombings.\n\n==See also==\n*List of countries by intentional homicide rate\n*2010 Chinese school attacks\n*Columbine High School massacre\n*Yang Jia\n*Mental health in China\n*Hebei tractor rampage\n*Timothy McVeigh\n*Andrew Kehoe\n*Qitaihe bombing\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n* Hatred, Revenge Motive for Fatal Shijiazhuang Explosions, People's Daily (March 26, 2001)\n* Bomber has confessed, China says , CNN (March 27, 2001)\n* Suspect Sought In China Blasts; Toll Is at 108, The New York Times (March 18, 2001)\n* Beijing Publishes Detailed Account of Bombings, The New York Times (March 28, 2001)\n* Three executed over China blasts, BBC (April 29, 2001)","urls":["http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/world\/asia-pacific\/1226222.stm","http:\/\/articles.latimes.com\/2001\/apr\/19\/news\/mn-52954","http:\/\/english.peopledaily.com.cn\/200103\/25\/eng20010325_65914.html","https:\/\/archive.today\/20130818231702\/http:\/\/english.peopledaily.com.cn\/200103\/25\/eng20010325_65914.html","https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/worldnews\/asia\/china\/1316667\/Four-face-execution-for-Chinese-bombings-but-doubts-linger.html","http:\/\/premium.europe.cnn.com\/2001\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/east\/03\/27\/china.bomber.confess\/index.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110708171054\/http:\/\/premium.europe.cnn.com\/2001\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/east\/03\/27\/china.bomber.confess\/index.html","http:\/\/www.xinhuanet.com\/focus\/xiangguan\/jiaodian00503.htm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20191007155146\/http:\/\/www.xinhuanet.com\/focus\/xiangguan\/jiaodian00503.htm","http:\/\/www.gzjd.gov.cn\/pub\/index_jsp_catid_11_24_id_1157.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100905062322\/http:\/\/www.gzjd.gov.cn\/pub\/index_jsp_catid_11_24_id_1157.html","http:\/\/www.people.com.cn\/GB\/historic\/0316\/5929.html","http:\/\/news.sina.com.cn\/c\/241938.html","https:\/\/archive.today\/20130818231547\/http:\/\/news.sina.com.cn\/c\/241938.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/03\/28\/world\/beijing-publishes-detailed-account-of-bombings.html?scp=3&sq=shijiazhuang+explosion&st=nyt","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/asia-pacific\/1231383.stm","https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/asia\/chinese-police-in-search-for-bomber-687884.html","http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2001\/mar\/20\/china.johngittings","http:\/\/www.qingdaonews.com\/content\/2001-04\/30\/content_199127.htm"]}
{"title":"Ghriba synagogue bombing","article":"-->\n}}\n\n\nThe Ghriba synagogue bombing was carried out by Niser bin Muhammad Nasr Nawar on the El Ghriba synagogue in Tunisia in 2002.\n\n==Bombing==\nOn April 11, 2002, a natural gas truck fitted with explosives drove past security barriers at the ancient El Ghriba synagogue on the Tunisian island of Djerba. The truck detonated at the front of the synagogue, killing 14 German tourists, three Tunisians, and two French nationals. More than 30 others were wounded.\n\n\n\nAlthough the explosion was initially called an accident, as Tunisia, France, and Germany investigated, it became clear that it was a deliberate attack. A 24-year-old man named Niser bin Muhammad Nasr Nawar was the suicide bomber, who carried out the attack with the aid of a relative. Al-Qaeda later claimed responsibility for the attack, which was reportedly organized by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Saad bin Laden. However, Saad's family denied he was involved in the attack.\n\nIn March 2003, five people were arrested in Spain who were believed to have financed this attack. In April 2003, a German man named Christian Ganczarski was arrested in Paris in connection with the bombing. He was arrested by a joint intelligence operation, in the frame of Alliance Base, which is located in Paris, and transferred to Fresnes Prison in Paris. In February 2009, Ganczarski was sentenced to 18 years in prison for the bombing.\n\n==Commemoration of the victims==\n10 years after the attack, thanks to freedom of expression and organization brought by the 2011 Tunisian revolution, a Djerbian citizens' initiative to break the silence was adopted by the Presidency of the Republic and concerned embassies to commemorate victims of this attack.\n\n\nImage:Marche 11 avril.jpg|Silent march\nImage:Hommage_11_avril.jpg|Flowers laid for those killed in the attack\nImage:Blumen 11 April.jpg\nImage:Flowers 11 avril.jpg\n\n\nOn April 11, 2012, Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki, professor Horst-Wolfram Kerll (de), the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany to Tunisia and Boris Boillon, Ambassador of the French Republic to Tunisia, marched silently in homage to the victims. Moncef Marzouki met with present victims' families and delivered a memorial speech where he strongly condemned this attack and expressed on behalf of the people of Tunisia and the Tunisian government a deep compassion for victims and their families.\n\n==See also==\n* List of terrorist incidents in Tunisia\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/middle_east\/1923522.stm<\/ref>","https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/worldnews\/africaandindianocean\/tunisia\/1390998\/Synagogue-explosion-no-accident.html<\/ref>","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/middle_east\/2061071.stm<\/ref>","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/europe\/7873543.stm<\/ref>","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/south_asia\/2161232.stm<\/ref>","http:\/\/www.aawsat.net\/2009\/12\/article55252427<\/ref>","http:\/\/www.aawsat.net\/2010\/03\/article55251341<\/ref>","http:\/\/www.expatica.com\/nl\/news\/local_news\/Al-Qaeda-militant-found-guilty-for-Tunisian-synagogue-attack-_49356.html"]}

{"title":"Alfortville Armenian Genocide Memorial bombings","article":"The Alfortville Armenian Genocide Memorial bombing was a hit-team headed attack undertaken by Grey Wolves member Abdullah \u00c7atli and paid for by the Turkish National Intelligence Organization. It occurred on 3 May 1984, in a heavily Armenian populated district of Alfortville, Val-de-Marne, \u00cele-de-France.\n\nThe target chosen for the attack was a memorial dedicated to the victims of the Armenian Genocide on the rue \u00c9tienne Dolet which was inaugurated on 24 April 1984, the 69th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. The Turkish press denounced the monument as a \"monument of hate\". About a week after the inauguration, three bombs were reported to have exploded on 3 May 1984, resulting in thirteen injuries, two of them serious. The monument, made of Khachkar stone, was severely damaged in the blasts. The mayor of Alfortville at the time, Joseph Franceschi, who was also the Secretary of State for Public Security, condemned the attack. Jean Poperen, who was the National Secretary for the Socialist Party of France, also condemned the attack and expressed his solidarity with the Armenians of France.\n\nAn investigation was begun immediately after the attack.  It was later reported by one newspaper that the attack was operated by the Turkish National Intelligence Organization or M\u0130T. The memorial bombing came after several bombings that occurred against Armenian institutions and monuments throughout France, such as the bombing of the Armenian Cultural Center in Alfortville in 1983.\n\nA second attack occurred during the evening of 13 April 2002; three unknown assailants threw three molotov cocktails at the monument, causing the monument to be severely damaged. The attack occurred within days of the 87th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. An investigation was launched by the local Alfortville police but the assailants were never caught.\n\n==See also==\n*Anti-Armenianism\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/encyclopediaofmo0000atki\/page\/110","https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/encyclopediaofmo0000atki\/page\/110","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=PAU5AAAAMAAJ&q","http:\/\/www.todayszaman.com\/tz-web\/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=150621","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20080824065057\/http:\/\/www.todayszaman.com\/tz-web\/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=150621","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=qOwzAAAAIAAJ&q","https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=UDAWAQAAMAAJ&q","http:\/\/asbarez.com\/46731\/armenian-genocide-monument-in-french-city-damaged\/"]}
{"title":"Jordanian embassy bombing in Baghdad","article":"On 7 August 2003, a bomb exploded outside the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, killing 17 people and injuring dozens more. The bomb, concealed in a minibus, exploded outside the walls of the embassy compound at around 11:00am local time. The force of the explosion sent a car onto a nearby rooftop and killed several people nearby including women and children. Six police officers guarding the embassy were among the dead. Immediately after the blast, the embassy compound was swarmed by a mob of Iraqis who ransacked the building, chanting anti-Jordanian slogans and burning portraits of King Abdullah II. According to Lieutenant-General Ricardo Sanchez, the commander of US forces in Iraq, the attack was the worst in Iraq since the capture of Baghdad that previous March.  \n\n== Perpetrators ==\nNo group claimed the attack. A team of agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation was dispatched to Iraq shortly after to investigate the bombing.

{"title":"2004 Madrid train bombings","article":"The 2004 Madrid train bombings (also known in Spain as 11-M) were nearly simultaneous, coordinated bombings against the Cercan\u00edas commuter train system of Madrid, Spain, on the morning of 11 March 2004 \u2013 three days before Spain's general elections. The explosions killed 193 people and injured around 2,000. The bombings constituted the deadliest terrorist attack carried out in the history of Spain and the deadliest in Europe since the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The official investigation by the Spanish judiciary found that the attacks were directed by an al-Qaeda terrorist cell, although no direct al-Qaeda participation has been established. Although they had no role in the planning or implementation, the Spanish miners who sold the explosives to the terrorists were also arrested.\n\nControversy regarding the handling and representation of the bombings by the government arose, with Spain's two main political parties\u2014Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and Partido Popular (PP)\u2014accusing each other of concealing or distorting evidence for electoral reasons. The bombings occurred three days before general elections in which incumbent Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar's PP was defeated. Immediately after the bombing, leaders of the PP claimed evidence indicating the Basque separatist organization ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna) was responsible for the bombings. Islamic extremists' responsibility would have had the opposite political effect, as it would have been seen as a consequence of the PP government taking Spain into the Iraq War, a policy extremely unpopular among Spaniards.\n\nFollowing the attacks, there were nationwide demonstrations and protests demanding that the government \"tell the truth\". The prevailing opinion of political analysts is that the Aznar administration lost the general elections as a result of the handling and representation of the terrorist attacks, rather than because of the bombings per se. Results published in The Review of Economics and Statistics by economist Jose G. Montalvo seem to suggest that indeed the bombings had important electoral impact  (turning the electoral outcome against the incumbent People's Party and handing government over to the Socialist Party, PSOE).\n\nAfter 21 months of investigation, judge Juan del Olmo tried Moroccan national Jamal Zougam, among several others, for his participation carrying out the attack. The September 2007 sentence established no known mastermind nor direct al-Qaeda link.\n\n==Description==\n\n\nDuring the peak of Madrid rush hour on the morning of Thursday, 11 March 2004, ten explosions occurred aboard four commuter trains (cercan\u00edas). The date led to the popular abbreviation of the incident as \"11-M\". All the affected trains were traveling on the same line and in the same direction between Alcal\u00e1 de Henares and the Atocha station in Madrid. It was later reported that thirteen improvised explosive devices (IEDs) had been placed on the trains. Bomb disposal teams (TEDAX) arriving at the scenes of the explosions detonated two of the remaining three IEDs in controlled explosions, but the third was not found until later in the evening, having been stored inadvertently with luggage taken from one of the trains. The following time-line of events comes from the judicial investigation.\n\nAll four trains had departed the Alcal\u00e1 de Henares station between 07:01 and 07:14. The explosions took place between 07:37 and 07:40, as described below (all timings given are in local time CET, UTC +1):\n* Atocha Station (train number 21431) \u2013 Three bombs exploded. Based on the video recording from the station security system, the first bomb exploded at 07:37, and two others exploded within 4\u00a0seconds of each other at 07:38.\n* El Pozo del T\u00edo Raimundo Station (train number 21435) \u2013 At approximately 07:38, just as the train was starting to leave the station, two bombs exploded in different carriages.\n* Santa Eugenia Station (train number 21713) \u2013 One bomb exploded at approximately 07:38.\n* Calle T\u00e9llez (train number 17305), approximately 800\u00a0meters from Atocha Station \u2013 Four bombs exploded in different carriages of the train at approximately 07:39.\n\nAt 08:00, emergency relief workers began arriving at the scenes of the bombings. The police reported numerous victims and spoke of 50 wounded and several dead. By 08:30 the emergency ambulance service, SAMUR (Servicio de Asistencia Municipal de Urgencia y Rescate), had set up a field hospital at the Daoiz y Velarde sports facility. Bystanders and local residents helped relief workers, as hospitals were told to expect the arrival of many casualties. At 08:43, firefighters reported 15 dead at El Pozo. By 09:00, the police had confirmed the death of at least 30 people \u2013 20 at El Pozo and about 10 in Santa Eugenia and Atocha. People combed the city's major hospitals in search of family members who they thought were aboard the trains. There were 193 confirmed dead victims.\n\n\n\nThe total number of victims was higher than in any other terrorist attack in Spain, far surpassing the 21 killed and 40 wounded from a 1987 bombing at a Hipercor chain supermarket in Barcelona. On that occasion, responsibility was claimed by ETA. It was Europe's worst terror attack since the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988.\n\n==Further bombings spur investigation==\n\n\nA device composed of 12 kilograms of Goma-2 ECO with a detonator and 136\u00a0meters of wire (connected to nothing) was found on the track of a high-speed railway line (AVE) on 2 April. The Spanish judiciary chose not to investigate that incident and the perpetrators remain unknown. The device used in the AVE incident was unable to explode because it lacked an initiation system.\n\nShortly after the AVE incident, police identified an apartment in Legan\u00e9s, south of Madrid, as the base of operations for the individuals suspected of being the perpetrators of the Madrid and AVE attacks. The suspected militants, headed by Jamal Zougam, Sarhane Abdelmaji \"the Tunisian\" and Jamal Ahmidan \"the Chinese\", were trapped inside the apartment by a police raid on the evening of Saturday 3 April. At 9:03\u00a0pm, when the police started to assault the premises, the militants committed suicide by setting off explosives, killing themselves and one of the police officers.\nInvestigators subsequently found that the explosives used in the Legan\u00e9s explosion were of the same type as those used in the 11 March attacks (though it had not been possible to identify a brand of dynamite from samples taken from the trains) and in the thwarted bombing of the AVE line.\n\nBased on the assumption that the militants killed at Legan\u00e9s were indeed the individuals responsible for the train bombings, the ensuing investigation focused on how they obtained their estimated 200\u00a0kg of explosives. The investigation revealed that they had been bought from a retired miner who still had access to blasting equipment.\n\n\nFive to eight suspects believed to be involved in the 11 March attacks managed to escape.\n\nIn December 2006, the newspaper ABC reported that ETA reminded Spanish Prime Minister Zapatero about 11 March 2004 as an example of what could happen unless the government considered their petitions (in reference to the 2004 electoral swing), although the source also makes it clear that ETA 'had nothing to do' with the attack itself.\n\n===Aftermath===\n\n\n\nIn France, the Vigipirate plan was upgraded to orange level. In Italy, the government declared a state of high alert.\n\nIn December 2004, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero claimed that the PP government erased all of the computer files related to the Madrid bombings, leaving only the documents on paper.\n\nOn 25 March 2005, prosecutor Olga S\u00e1nchez asserted that the bombings happened 911 days after the 11 September attacks due to the \"highly symbolic and qabbalistic charge for local Al-Qaida groups\" of choosing that day. Because 2004 was a leap year, 912 days had elapsed between 11 September 2001 and 11 March 2004.\n\nOn 27 May 2005, the Pr\u00fcm Convention, implementing inter alia the principle of availability which began to be discussed after the Madrid bombings, was signed by Germany, Spain, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium.\n\nOn 4 January 2007, El Pa\u00eds reported that Algerian Ouhnane Daoud, who is considered to be the mastermind of the 11-M bombings, has been searching for ways to return to Spain to prepare further attacks, though this has not been confirmed.\n\nOn 17 March 2008, Basel Ghalyoun, Mohamed Almallah Dabas, Abdelillah El-Fadual El-Akil and Ra\u00fal Gonz\u00e1lez Pe\u00f1a, having been previously found guilty by the Audiencia Nacional, were released after a Higher Court ruling. This court also verified the release of the Egyptian Rabei Osman al-Sayed.\n\n==Responsibility==\n\n\nOn 14 March 2004, Abu Dujana al-Afghani, a purported spokesman for al-Qaeda in Europe, appeared in a videotape claiming responsibility for the attacks.\n\nThe Spanish judiciary stated that a loose group of Moroccan, Syrian, and Algerian Muslims and two Guardia Civil and Spanish police informants were suspected of having carried out the attacks. On 11 April 2006, Judge Juan del Olmo charged 29 suspects for their involvement in the train bombings.\n\nNo evidence has been found of al-Qaeda involvement, although an al-Qaeda claim was made the day of the attacks by the Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades. U.S. officials note that this group is \"notoriously unreliable\". In August 2007, al-Qaeda claimed to be \"proud\" about the Madrid 2004 bombings.\n\nThe Independent reported that \"Those who invented the new kind of rucksack bomb used in the attacks are said to have been taught in training camps in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, under instruction from members of Morocco's radical Islamist Combat Group.\"\n\nMohamed Darif, a professor of political science at Hassan II University in Mohammedia, stated in 2004 that the history of the Moroccan Combat Group is directly tied to the rise of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. According to Darif, \"Since its inception at the end of the 1990s and until 2001, the role of the organisation was restricted to giving logistic support to al-Qaeda in Morocco, finding its members places to live, providing them with false papers, with the opportunity of marrying Moroccans and with false identities to allow them to travel to Europe. Since 11 September, however, which brought the Kingdom of Morocco in on the side of the fight against terrorism, the organisation switched strategies and opted for terrorist attacks within Morocco itself.\"\n\nScholar Rogelio Alonso said in 2007, \"the investigation had uncovered a link between the Madrid suspects and the wider world of al-Qaida\". Scott Atran said \"There isn't the slightest bit of evidence of any relationship with al-Qaida. We've been looking at it closely for years and we've been briefed by everybody under the sun... and nothing connects them.\" He provides a detailed timeline that lends credence to this view.\n\nAccording to the European Strategic Intelligence and Security Center, this is the only extremist terrorist act in the history of Europe where international Islamic extremists collaborated with non-Muslims.\n\nFormer Spanish Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar said in 2011 that Abdelhakim Belhadj, leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group and current head of the Tripoli Military Council, was suspected of complicity in the bombings.\n\n===Allegations of ETA involvement===\n \n\nImmediate reactions to the attacks in Madrid were the several press conferences held by the Spanish prime minister Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar involving ETA. The Spanish government maintained this theory for two days. Because the bombs were detonated three days before the general elections in Spain, the situation had many political interpretations. The United States also initially believed ETA was responsible, then questioning if Islamic extremists were responsible. Spain's third-largest newspaper, ABC, immediately labelled the attacks as \"ETA's bloodiest attack.\"\n\nDue to the government theory, statements issued shortly after the Madrid attacks, including from lehendakari Juan Jos\u00e9 Ibarretxe identified ETA as the prime suspect, but the group, which usually claims responsibility for its actions, denied any involvement. Later evidence strongly pointed to the involvement of extremist Islamist groups, with the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group named as a focus of investigations.\n\nAlthough ETA has a history of mounting bomb attacks in Madrid, the 11 March attacks exceeded any attack previously attempted by a European organisation. This led some experts to point out that the tactics used were more typical of militant Islamic extremist groups, perhaps with a certain link to al-Qaeda, or maybe to a new generation of ETA activists using al-Qaeda as a role model. Observers also noted that ETA customarily, but not always, issues warnings before its mass bombings and that there had been no warning for this attack. Europol director J\u00fcrgen Storbeck commented that the bombings \"could have been ETA... But we're dealing with an attack that doesn't correspond to the modus operandi they have adopted up to now\".\n\nPolitical analysts believe ETA's guilt would have strengthened the PP's chances of being re-elected, as this would have been regarded as the death throes of a terrorist organisation reduced to desperate measures by the strong anti-terrorist policy of the Aznar administration. On the other hand, an Islamic extremist attack would have been perceived as the direct result of Spain's involvement in Iraq, an unpopular war that had not been approved by the Spanish Parliament.\n\n===Investigation===\nAll of the devices are thought to have been hidden inside backpacks. The police investigated reports of three people in ski masks getting on and off the trains several times at Alcal\u00e1 de Henares between 7:00 and 7:10. A Renault Kangoo van was found parked outside the station at Alcal\u00e1 de Henares containing detonators, audio tapes with Qur'anic verses, and cell phones.\n\nThe provincial chief of TEDAX (the bomb disposal experts of the Spanish police) declared on 12 July 2004 that damage in the trains could not be caused by dynamite, but by some type of military explosive, like C3 or C4. An unnamed source from the Aznar administration claimed that the explosive used in the attacks had been Titadine (used by ETA, and intercepted on its way to Madrid 11 days before).\n\nIn March 2007, the TEDAX chief claimed that they knew that the unexploded explosive found in the Kangoo van was Goma-2 ECO the very day of the bombings. He also asserted that \"it is impossible to know\" the components of the explosives that went off in the trains \u2013 though he later asserted that it was dynamite. The Judge Javier G\u00f3mez Berm\u00fadez replied \"I cannot understand\" to these assertions.\n\n===Examination of unexploded devices===\nA radio report mentioned a plastic explosive called \"Special C\". However, the government said that the explosive found in an unexploded device, discovered among bags thought to be victims' lost luggage, was the Spanish made Goma-2 ECO. The unexploded device contained  of explosive with  of nails and screws packed around it as shrapnel. In the aftermath of the attacks, however, the chief coroner alleged that no shrapnel was found in any of the victims.\n\nGoma-2 ECO was never before used by al-Qaeda, but the explosive and the modus operandi were described by The Independent as ETA trademarks, although the Daily Telegraph came to the opposite conclusion.\n\nTwo bombs, one in Atocha and another in El Pozo stations, numbers 11 and 12, were detonated accidentally by the TEDAX. According to the provincial chief of the TEDAX, deactivated rucksacks contained some other type of explosive. The 13th bomb, which was transferred to a police station, contained dynamite, although it did not explode because it was missing two wires connecting the explosives to the detonator. That bomb used a mobile phone (Mitsubishi Trium) as a timer, requiring a SIM card to activate the alarm and thereby detonate. The analysis of the SIM card allowed the police to arrest an alleged perpetrator. On Saturday, 13 March, when three Moroccans and two Pakistani Muslims were arrested for the attacks, it was confirmed that the attacks came from an Islamic group. Only one of the five persons (the Moroccan Jamal Zougam) detained that day was finally prosecuted.\n\nThe Guardia Civil developed an extensive action plan to monitor records corresponding with the use of weapons and explosives. There were 166,000 inspections conducted throughout the country between March 2004 and November 2004. About 2,500 violations were discovered and over 3 tons of explosives, 11 kilometers of detonating cord, and over 15,000 detonators were seized.\n\n===Suicide of suspects===\n\n\nOn 3 April 2004, in Legan\u00e9s, south Madrid, four terrorists died in an apparent suicide explosion, killing one Grupo Especial de Operaciones (GEO) (Spanish special police assault unit) police officer and wounding eleven policemen. According to witnesses and media, between five and eight suspects escaped that day.\n\nSecurity forces carried out a controlled explosion of a suspicious package found near the Atocha station and subsequently deactivated the two undetonated devices on the T\u00e9llez train. A third unexploded device was later brought from the station at El Pozo to a police station in Vallecas, and became a central piece of evidence for the investigation. It appears that the El Pozo bomb failed to detonate because a cell-phone alarm used to trigger the bomb was set 12 hours late.\n\n===Conspiracy theories===\nSectors of the People's Party (PP), and certain media, such as El Mundo newspaper and the COPE radio station, continue to support theories relating the attack to a vast conspiracy to remove the governing party from power. Support for the conspiracy was also given by the Asociaci\u00f3n de V\u00edctimas del Terrorismo (AVT), Spain's largest association of victims of terrorism.\n\nThese theories speculate that ETA and members of the security forces and national and foreign (Morocco) secret services were involved in the bombings. Defenders of the claims that ETA participated in some form in the 11 March attacks have affirmed that there is circumstantial evidence linking the Islamic extremists with two ETA members who were detained while driving the outskirts of Madrid in a van containing 500\u00a0kg of explosives 11 days before the train bombings. The Madrid judge Coro Cill\u00e1n is continuing to hear conspiracy theory cases, including one accusing government officials of ordering the scrapping of the bombed train cars in order to destroy evidence.\n\n===Invasion of Iraq policy===\nThe public seemed convinced that the Madrid Bombings were a result of the Aznar government's alignment with the U.S. and its invasion of Iraq. The terrorists behind the 11-M attack were somewhat successful because of the election outcome. Before the attack, the incumbent Popular Party led the polls by 5 percent. It is believed that the Popular Party would have won the election if it had not been for the terrorist attack. The Socialist Party, led by Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, ended up winning the election by 5%. The Socialist Party had called for the removal of Spanish troops from Iraq during its campaigning. Zapatero promised to remove Spanish troops by 30 June 2004, and the troops were withdrawn a month earlier than expected. Twenty-eight percent of voters said that the bombings influenced their opinions and vote. An estimated 1 million voters switched their vote to the Socialist Party after the Madrid bombings. These voters who switched their votes were no longer willing to support the Popular Party's stance on war policy. The bombings also influenced 1,700,000 citizens to vote who did not plan on originally voting. On the other hand, the terrorist attacks discouraged 300,000 people from voting. Overall, there was a net 4 percent increase in voter turnout.\n\n===Trial===\nJudge Juan del Olmo found \"local cells of Islamic extremists inspired through the Internet\" guilty for the 11 March attacks, not Armed Islamic Group or Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group. These local cells consist of hashish traffickers of Moroccan origin, remotely linked to an al-Qaeda cell that had been already captured. These groups bought the explosives (dynamite Goma-2 ECO) from low-level thieves, police and Guardia Civil informers in Asturias using money from the small-scale drug trafficking.\n\nAccording to El Mundo, \"the notes found on the Moroccan informer 'Cartagena' prove that the Police had the leaders of the cell responsible for the 11 March attacks under surveillance.\" However, none of the notes refer to the preparation of any terrorist attack.\n\nThe trial of 29 defendants began on 15 February 2007. According to El Pa\u00eds, \"the Court dismantled one by one all conspiracy theories\" and demonstrated that any link with or involvement in the bombings by ETA was either misleading or groundless. During the trial the defendants retracted their previous statements and denied any involvement. According to El Mundo the questions of \"by whom, why, when and where the Madrid train attacks were planned\" are still \"unanswered\", because the alleged masterminds of the attacks were acquitted. El Mundo also claimed -among other misgivings- that the Spanish judiciary reached \"scientifically unsound\" conclusions about the kind of explosives used in the trains, and that no direct al-Qaeda link was found, thus \"debunking the key argument of the official version\". Anthropologist Scott Atran described the Madrid trial as \"a complete farce\" pointing out the fact that \"There isn't the slightest bit of evidence of any operational relationship with al-Qaida\". Instead, \"The overwhelming majority of [terrorist cells] in Europe have nothing to do with al-Qaida other than a vague relationship of ideology.\"\n\nThough the trial proceeded smoothly in its opening months, 14 of the 29 defendants began a hunger strike in May, protesting against the allegedly \"unfair\" role of political parties and media in the legal proceedings. Judge Javier G\u00f3mez Berm\u00fadez refused to suspend the trial despite the strike, and the hunger strikers ended their fast on 21 May.\n\nThe last hearing of the trial was held on 2 July 2007.\nTranscripts and videos of the hearings can be seen on datadiar.tv.\n\nOn 31 October 2007, the Audiencia Nacional of Spain handed down its judgements. Of the 28 defendants in the trial, 21 were found guilty on a range of charges from forgery to murder. Two of the defendants were sentenced each to more than 40,000 years in prison.\n\n==Police surveillance and informants==\nIn the investigations carried out to find out what went wrong in the security services, many individual negligences and miscoordinations between different branches of the police were found. The group dealing with Islamist extremists was very small and in spite of having carried out some surveillances, they were unable to stop the bombings. Also, some of the criminals involved in the \"Little Mafia\" who provided the explosives were police informants and had leaked to their case officers some tips that were not followed up on.\n\nSome of the alleged perpetrators of the bombing were reportedly under surveillance by the Spanish police since 2001.\n\nAt the time of the Madrid bombings, Spain was well equipped with internal security structures that were, for the most part, effective in the fight against terrorism. It became evident that there were coordination issues between police forces as well as within each of them. The Interior Ministry focused on correcting these weaknesses. It was Spain's goal to strengthen its police intelligence in order to deal with the risks and threats of international terrorism. This decision for the National Police and the Guardia Civil to strengthen their counter-terrorism services, led to an increase in jobs aimed at preventing and fighting global terrorism. Counter-terrorism services increased its employment by nearly 35% during the legislature. Human resources in external information services, dealing with international terrorism, grew by 72% in the National Police force and 22% in the Guardia Civil.\n\n==Controversies==\n\nThe authorship of the bombings remains a controversial issue in Spain. Sectors of the Partido Popular (PP) and some of the PP-friendly media outlets (primarily El Mundo and the Libertad Digital radio station) claim that there are inconsistencies and contradictions in the Spanish judicial investigation.\n\nAs Spanish and international investigations continue to claim the unlikeliness of ETA's active implication, these claims have shifted from direct accusations involving the Basque separatist organisation to less specific insinuations and general scepticism.\nAdditionally, there is controversy over the events that took place between the bombings and the general elections held three days later.\n\n==Reactions==\n\n\nIn the aftermath of the bombings, there were massive street demonstrations across Spain to protest against the train bombings. The international reaction was also notable, as the scale of the attack became clearer.\n\n==Memorial service for victims==\nA memorial service for the victims of this incident was held on 15 March 2004, 3 days after the incident. It was attended by King Juan Carlos I, Queen Sofia, victims' families, and about 5,000 official guests, included world leaders.\n\n==See also==\n\n\n===Specifically about the 2004 Madrid bombings===\n* Atocha station memorial\n* Brandon Mayfield, wrongfully identified via fingerprints\n* Casualties of the 2004 Madrid bombings\n* Controversies about the 2004 Madrid train bombings\n* Forest of Remembrance\n* Reactions to the 2004 Madrid train bombings\n* Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero\n* 2004 Madrid train bombings suspects\n* Rabei Osman\n\n===Other===\n* List of terrorist incidents involving railway systems\n* 2000 Madrid bombing\n* 2006 Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport bombing\n* 11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings\n* 7 July 2005 London bombings\n* 2006 German train bombing attempts\n* 2006 Ontario terrorism plot\n* November 2015 Paris attacks\n\n==References==\n\n\n\n==External links==\n\n*  BBC News In Depth\n* U.N.

{"title":"2004 Multan bombing","article":"The 2004 Multan bombing was a car bombing that took place in Multan, Punjab, Pakistan on October 7, 2004. The death toll was 40 and the number of injured was close to 100.\n\n==Incident==\nThe attack happened around 4:30 am and was carried out against Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan members who gathered in thousands to mourn the death of their leader Azam Tariq. The bomb, according to Interior Minister Aftab Khan Sherpao was remote-controlled and was placed inside of a Suzuki car. Eyewitnesses reported that they heard two blasts with a 20-second interval. Besides killing innocent civilians the bomb also damaged some nearby buildings and left puddles of blood and human flesh scattered around.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nAfter the attack the Pakistani police were deployed to the site amid the attacks from protestors who burned tires, damaged windscreens, and attacked two ambulances. Later on the police arrested Irfan Ali Shah who was eventually found guilty on 40 counts of terrorism for masterminding the double bombing and was sentenced to death in 2006.\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/www.worldsecuritynetwork.com\/Broader-Middle-East\/Davies-Elizabeth\/Pakistan-car-bomb-kills-40-during-rally","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140222061313\/http:\/\/www.worldsecuritynetwork.com\/Broader-Middle-East\/Davies-Elizabeth\/Pakistan-car-bomb-kills-40-during-rally","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/south_asia\/5306402.stm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140222061505\/http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/south_asia\/5306402.stm","http:\/\/www.chinadaily.com.cn\/english\/doc\/2004-10\/07\/content_380150.htm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140222235142\/http:\/\/www.chinadaily.com.cn\/english\/doc\/2004-10\/07\/content_380150.htm","http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/373030\/massive-car-bomb-blast-kills-39-in-multan","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140222023315\/http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/373030\/massive-car-bomb-blast-kills-39-in-multan","http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/deadly-double-bombing-in-pakistan-06-10-2004\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140222201643\/http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/deadly-double-bombing-in-pakistan-06-10-2004\/","http:\/\/www.chinadaily.com.cn\/english\/doc\/2004-10\/07\/content_380132.htm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140222235148\/http:\/\/www.chinadaily.com.cn\/english\/doc\/2004-10\/07\/content_380132.htm"]}
{"title":"2005 Bangladesh series bombings","article":"On 17 August 2005, around 500 bomb explosions occurred at 300 locations in 63 out of the 64 districts of Bangladesh. The bombs exploded within a half-hour period starting from 11:30\u00a0am. A Islamist terrorist organization, Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) claimed responsibility for the bombings. The group, led by Shaykh Abdur Rahman and Siddiqur Rahman (also known as Bangla Bhai), is alleged to be affiliated with Al Qaeda, although this has not been proven. Another Islamic terrorist group, named Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, was associated with JMB in executing the co-ordinated attack. Following the bombings, both groups were banned by the Government of Bangladesh.\n\n==Attacks==\nThe bomb exploded near Government facilities. In Dhaka, they exploded near Bangladesh Secretariat, the Supreme Court Complex, the Prime Minister's Office, the Dhaka University campus, the Dhaka Sheraton Hotel and Zia International Airport. At least 115 people injured. 500 small bombs were exploded in 62 out of 63 districts of Bangladesh. The explosion killed two people (a child in Savar, near Dhaka, and a rickshaw-puller in Chapai Nawabganj District), and injured a further 50.\n\n==Victims==\n*Rickshaw driver Rabiul Islam was injured when seven bombs exploded at about 11:10am at Biswa Road crossing near Shah Neamatullah College in the Nawabganj. He died on way to Rajshahi Medical College Hospital.\n*Schoolboy Abdus Salam, who was 10 was injured when bomb exploded outside his house in Savar. He died in the hospital.\n\n==Trials==\nThe main perpetrators of the bombing, Bangla Bhai and Shaykh Abdur Rahman, were captured by the Rapid Action Battalion in early March 2006. They were convicted of murder and terrorism charges, along with four other militants, and were executed by hanging on 30 March 2007. 5 suspects were sentenced to death and one to 20 years in prison for their part in the bomb attacks in Bogra. By 2013, 200 cases out of 273 cases filed in connection with 2005 Bangladesh bombings have been disposed of. Different courts have sentenced 58 people to death and  150 were sentenced to life in prison and 300 others were sentenced to various terms in prisons.\n\n==Reactions==\n*The Indian Government expressed \"serious concern and strong condemnation\" of the bombings.\n*Motiur Rahman Nizami, the then industry minister, from Jamaat-e-Islami blamed India for the blast.\n* Moudud Ahmed, the then law minister, from Bangladesh Nationalist Party said \"If they try for 100 years, they will not turn Bangladesh into a Taliban state,\".\n*The then chief cleric Ubaidul Haq remarked to thousands of worshippers at Baitul Mukarram Mosque, \"Islam prohibits suicide bombings. These bombers are enemies of Islam. It is a duty for all Muslims to stand up against those who are killing people in the name of Islam.\"\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/archives.dailytimes.com.pk\/foreign\/05-Sep-2005\/bangladesh-arrests-200-over-august-bombings","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150709194645\/http:\/\/archives.dailytimes.com.pk\/foreign\/05-Sep-2005\/bangladesh-arrests-200-over-august-bombings","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2005\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/08\/17\/bangladesh.blasts\/index.html?eref=sitesearch","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/south_asia\/4158478.stm","http:\/\/archive.thedailystar.net\/2005\/08\/18\/d5081801011.htm","http:\/\/today.reuters.com\/news\/articlenews.aspx?type=worldNews&storyid=2006-03-06T033152Z_01_SP286968_RTRUKOC_0_US-SECURITY-BANGLADESH.xml","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20070331061726\/http:\/\/today.reuters.com\/news\/articlenews.aspx?type=worldNews","http:\/\/www.ptinews.com\/pti%5Cptisite.nsf\/0\/F1194691BFD3FAB565257567004AFE16?OpenDocument","http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/news\/international\/five-islamists-jailed-for-2005-bangladesh-bombings\/article562869.ece","http:\/\/www.dhakatribune.com\/politics\/2013\/aug\/17\/no-list-made-executors-august-17-blasts","http:\/\/www.chinadaily.com.cn\/english\/doc\/2005-08\/19\/content_470505.htm","http:\/\/www.economist.com\/node\/4327181","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/south_asia\/4512406.stm"]}
{"title":"Assassination of Rafic Hariri","article":"On 14 February 2005, former Prime Minister of Lebanon Rafic Hariri was killed along with 21 others in an explosion in Beirut, Lebanon. Explosives equivalent to around 1,000\u00a0kilograms (2,200 pounds) of TNT were detonated as his motorcade drove near the St. George Hotel. Among the dead were several of Hariri's bodyguards and former Minister of the Economy, Bassel Fleihan.\n\nHariri had been part of the anti-Syrian opposition in Lebanon. His assassination triggered the Cedar Revolution, a popular movement which forced Syria to withdraw all its troops in Lebanon by April 2005. The killing also led the United Nations to set up the Special Tribunal for Lebanon to investigate the killing. The Special Tribunal, along with an independent investigation carried out by Lebanese brigadier general Wissam Al-Hassan, found compelling evidence for the responsibility of Lebanese group Hezbollah in the assassination.\n\n==Background==\nHariri and others in the anti-Syrian opposition had questioned the plan to extend the term of Lebanese President Emile Lahoud, emboldened by popular anger and civic action that became the Cedar Revolution. Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, a newer recruit of the anti-Syrian opposition, said after the assassination that in August 2004 Syrian President Bashar al-Assad threatened Hariri personally in a meeting, saying \"Lahoud represents me...If you and Chirac want me out of Lebanon, I will destroy Lebanon.\" His account is quoted, but not confirmed, in the UN's FitzGerald Report. The report stops short of directly accusing Damascus or any other party, saying that only a further thorough international inquest can identify the culprit.\n\n\n\nAccording to these testimonies, Hariri reminded Assad of his pledge not to seek an extension for Lahoud's term, and Assad replied that there was a policy shift and that the decision was already taken. He added that Lahoud should be viewed as his personal representative in Lebanon and that \"opposing him is tantamount to opposing Assad himself\". He then added that he (Assad) \"would rather break Lebanon over the heads of Hariri and [Druze leader] Walid Jumblatt than see his word in Lebanon broken\".\n\nAccording to the testimonies, Assad then threatened both longtime allies Hariri and Jumblatt with physical harm if they opposed the extension for Lahoud. The meeting reportedly lasted for ten minutes, and was the last time Hariri met with Assad. After that meeting, Hariri told his supporters that they had no other option but to support the extension for Lahoud. The Mission has also received accounts of further threats made to Hariri by security officials in case he abstained from voting in favor of the extension or \"even thought of leaving the country.\"\n\nIrish journalist Lara Marlowe also reported that Hariri told her he had been threatened by Assad.\n\nIn an interview with Der Spiegel, President Assad said, \"I never threatened him and no Syrian intelligence officer has ever pointed a gun to his head.\"\n\nOn September 2, 2004, the UN adopted United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559, which called for Syria to end its 29-year occupation of Lebanon.\n\n==Assassination==\nOn the morning of 14 February, Hariri visited parliament and then the Caf\u00e9 de l'Etoile for about twenty minutes. He left the cafe in a six-car convoy and followed a route that was kept secret until the very last minute. Six and a half minutes after leaving the cafe, as the convoy neared the St. George Hotel on the Corniche, a truck bomb exploded, destroying the convoy.\n\nThe blast left a crater thirty feet wide in the Corniche. A total of 22 people, including Hariri, were killed, and 220 more were injured. Dozens of cars were set on fire, several buildings were knocked down, and windows were blown out on many more.\n\nHariri was buried, along with the bodyguards who died in the bombing, in a location near Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque.\n\nA group calling itself \"The Nasra & Jihad Group in Greater Syria\" claimed responsibility for the blast. The group had not been heard from before. A tape aired by Al Jazeera showed a bearded man, believed to be a Palestinian named Ahmad Abu Adas, claiming the attack. Adas' home was raided but he remains missing. The UN report on the murder speculated he may have been the suicide bomber but also quotes a witness who said Adas had nothing to do with the bombing.\n\nThe UN report determined that the bomb had been placed in a white Mitsubishi Canter van, based on video footage from an HSBC bank. It was likely detonated by a suicide bomber, which would have evaded the electronic jamming devices of Hariri's convoy. Investigators determined that the Mitsubishi truck had been stolen from Sagamihara, Japan, on October 12, 2004.\n\n==Investigation==\n\n\nThe United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1595 to send an investigative team to look into Hariri's assassination. This team was headed by German judge Detlev Mehlis and presented its initial report to the Security Council on 20 October 2005. The Mehlis Report implicated Syrian and Lebanese officials, with special focus on Syria's military intelligence chief, late Assef Shawkat and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's brother-in-law. United States President George W. Bush called for a special meeting of the UN to be convened to discuss international response \"as quickly as possible to deal with this very serious matter.\" Detlev Mehlis asked for more time to investigate all leads. Lebanese politicians asked to extend the investigative team's duration and charter, to include assassinations of other prominent anti-Syrian Lebanese, such as Gebran Tueni. A second report, submitted on 10 December 2005, upheld the conclusions from the first report. On 11 January 2006, Mehlis was replaced by the Belgian Serge Brammertz.\n\nThe Lebanese government agreed to this inquiry, though calling for the full participation, not supremacy, of its own agencies and the respect of Lebanese sovereignty. The UN Security Council voted unanimously to demand full Syrian cooperation with UN investigators in the matter, and Brammertz's last two reports praised Syria's full co-operation.\n\nOn August 30, 2005, four pro-Syrian Lebanese generals (some of whom had promoted the false Abu Addas theory) were subsequently arrested under suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder. They were detained without charge by Lebanese authorities for four years and released by the STL when it took over the investigation in 2009. Mustafa Hamdan, former head of the Lebanese Presidential Guard brigade; Jamil al Sayyed, former Director-General of Security General; Ali al Hajj, director general of the Lebanese Internal Security Forces; and Raymond Azar, the former director of the Military Intelligence were released upon an order from the STL Pre-Trial Judge at the request of the Prosecutor due to lack of evidence. In making the request, the Prosecutor had considered \u201cinconsistencies in the statements of key witnesses and of a lack of corroborative evidence to support these statements.\u201d\n\nSyrian Minister of Interior Ghazi Kanaan was interviewed in September 2005 by Detlev Mehlis' team as a \"witness\" in the assassination. Kanaan denied any involvement in the assassination. On October 12, Kanaan was found dead with a gunshot wound to the head in his Damascus office.\" The Syrian government said it was a suicide, though others claimed it was murder to sever the link between Hariri's death and the regime.\n\nOn 30 December 2005, former Syrian vice president Abdul Halim Khaddam in a televised interview implicated Assad in the assassination and said that Assad personally threatened Hariri in the months before his death. This interview has caused Syrian MPs to demand treason charges against Khaddam.\n\n\n\nOn 18 December 2006, a progress report by former head of the investigation, Serge Brammertz, indicated that DNA evidence collected from the crime scene suggests that the assassination might be the act of a young male suicide bomber.\n\nOn 28 March 2008, the tenth report of the UN's International Independent Investigation Commission found that, \"a network of individuals acted in concert to carry out the assassination of Rafiq Hariri and that this criminal network \u2014 the \"Hariri Network\" \u2014 or parts thereof are linked to some of the other cases within the Commission's mandate.\"\n\nThe Security Council extended the mandate for the investigation, which was to end in December 2008, until 28 February 2009.\n\nOn 7 February 2012, Hurriyet reported investigators from the United Nations interviewed Louai Sakka, interested in whether he had played a role in the assassination.\n\n==UN Special Tribunal==\n\nThe Government of Lebanon and United Nations agreed to establish a Special Tribunal for Lebanon in 2007, signing the agreement on 23 January 2007 and 6 February 2007 respectively. When the agreement was sent to the Lebanese Parliament for ratification, however, the Speaker refused to convene Parliament to vote on it. Upon request from a majority of members of the Lebanese parliament and the Prime Minister, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1757, implementing the agreement.\n\nFor reasons of security, administrative efficiency and fairness, the Tribunal has its seat outside Lebanon, in Leidschendam, on the outskirts of The Hague, the Netherlands. The premises of the Tribunal is the former headquarters of the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service (Algemene Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst, or AIVD). The Netherlands originally agreed to host the Tribunal on December 21st, 2007. The court opened on 1 March 2009.\n\nThe Tribunal is the first international court to prosecute terrorism as a distinct crime.\n\nOn 29 April 2009, following a request of Prosecutor Daniel Bellemare, the Pre-Trial Judge determined that the four suspects arrested during the investigation could not be considered \"as either suspects or accused persons in the proceedings pending before the Tribunal\" and ordered their unconditional release. The detained persons were General Jamil al Sayyed (head of General Security), General Ali al Hajj (chief of internal security forces, the Lebanese police force), Brigadier-General Raymond Azar (head of Army Intelligence) and Brigadier-General Mustafa Hamdan (head of the presidential guard). Considered as Syria's main rule-enforcing agents at the time, they spent nearly 3 years and 8 months in detention after Lebanese authorities arrested them on 1 September 2005, and during that period no charges were ever pressed against them. Their release came amidst a tense political atmosphere in Lebanon, due to the officially admitted heavy politicization of the affair. Several anti-Syrian political figures have stated that \"[we] still consider them as guilty.\"\n\nOn 30 June 2011, Haaretz reported that the Tribunal had submitted to Lebanon's Prosecutor General indictments of four Lebanese Hezbollah members, and a foreigner. The indictments were served by representatives of the International Court of Justice at The Hague.\n\nOne of the Special Tribunal's leading figures was Lebanese Brigadier General Wissam al-Hassan. On 19 October 2012, al-Hassan was assassinated in a car explosion in the Achrafieh district of Beirut.\n\nProsecutor v. Ayyash et al. began on the 16th of January 2014 with an opening statement from the Prosecution. Salim Jamil Ayyash, Hassan Habib Merhi, Hussein Hassan Oneissi, and Assad Hassan Sabra are currently on trial in absentia, as it was determined they had absconded and did not wish to participate in the trial. The trial is ongoing.\n\n==Hezbollah==\nIn August 2010, in response to notification that the UN tribunal would indict some Hezbollah members, Secretary General of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah said Israel was looking for a way to assassinate Hariri as early as 1993 in order to create political chaos that would force Syria to withdraw from Lebanon, and to perpetuate an anti-Syrian atmosphere in Lebanon in the wake of the assassination. He went on to say that in 1996 Hezbollah apprehended an agent working for Israel by the name of Ahmed Nasrallah \u2013 no relation to Hassan Nasrallah \u2013 who allegedly contacted Hariri's security detail and told them that he had solid proof that Hezbollah was planning to take his life. Hariri then contacted Hezbollah and advised them of the situation. Saad Hariri responded that the UN should investigate these claims.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nHariri was well-regarded among international leaders; for example, he was a close friend of French President Jacques Chirac. Few felt he was a threat, due to his ties with the EU and the West. Chirac was one of the first foreign dignitaries to offer condolences to Hariri's widow in person at her home in Beirut. The Special Tribunal for Lebanon was also created at his instigation.\n\nFollowing Hariri's death, there were several other bombings and assassinations against anti-Syrian figures. These included Samir Kassir, George Hawi, Gebran Tueni, Pierre Amine Gemayel, and Walid Eido. Assassination attempts were made on Elias Murr, May Chidiac, and Samir Shehade (who was investigating Hariri's death).\n\n== See also ==\n\n*Syrian occupation of Lebanon\n*Mustafa Badreddine\n\n==References==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*J\u00fcrgen Cain K\u00fclbel: Mordakte Hariri: Unterdr\u00fcckte Spuren im Libanon, 2006, \n*J\u00fcrgen Cain K\u00fclbel: Ietail Al-Hariri.

{"title":"2006 Mumbai train bombings","article":"The 2006 Mumbai train bombings were a series of seven bomb blasts on 11 July. They took place over a period of 11\u00a0minutes on the Suburban Railway in Mumbai, the capital of the Indian state of Maharashtra and the nation's financial capital. The bombs were set off in pressure cookers on trains plying on the Western Line Suburban Section of the Mumbai Division of Western Railway. The blasts killed 209 people and injured over 700 more.\n\n== Blasts ==\n\nPressure cooker bombs were placed on trains on the Western Line of the suburban (\"local\") train network, which forms the backbone of the city's transport network. Pressure cookers were used in this bombing and other recent explosions to increase the afterburn in a thermobaric reaction, more powerful than conventional high explosives. The first blast reportedly took place at 18:24 IST (12:54 UTC), and the explosions continued for approximately eleven minutes, until 18:35, during the after-work rush hour. All the bombs had been placed in the first-class \"general\" compartments (as opposed to compartments reserved for women, called \"ladies\" compartments) of several trains running from Churchgate, the city-centre end of the western railway line, to the western suburbs of the city. They exploded at or in the near vicinity of the suburban railway stations of Matunga Road, Mahim Junction, Bandra, Khar Road, Jogeshwari, Bhayandar and Borivali. Home Minister Shivraj Patil told reporters that authorities had \"some\" information an attack was coming, \"but place and time was not known\".\n\nThe bomb attacks in Mumbai came hours after a series of grenade attacks in Srinagar, the largest city in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. Home Secretary V K Duggal said there was no link between the Srinagar and Mumbai bomb blasts.\n\n== Injuries and fatalities ==\n\n\nMaharashtra Deputy Chief Minister R. R. Patil confirmed that a total of 200 people were killed and another 714 others have been injured. Additionally, various news organisations have reported that at least 200 people have died and that more than 700 others have been injured. A week after the blasts in Mumbai the confirmed death toll rose to 207. In September 2006 it was confirmed that the death toll had risen to 209.\n\n== Response ==\n\nA state of high alert was declared in India's major cities. Both the airports in Mumbai were placed on high alert. The western line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway network was at first shut down, although some trains resumed service later, and stringent security arrangements, including frisking and searching of commuters, were instituted on the other lines of the network. The city's bus service, the BEST, pressed extra buses into service to transport stranded commuters home.\n\nThe Prime Minister also held a security meeting at his residence attended by Home Minister Shivraj Patil, National Security Advisor M K Narayanan, and Home Secretary V K Duggal.\n\n=== Resumption of services and return to normality ===\nWestern Railway services were restored on 11 July by 10.45\u00a0pm. As a show of investor confidence, the Bombay Stock Exchange rebounded, starting the day with the BSE Sensex Index up by nearly 1% in morning trade. Foreign investors also retained confidence, with the Sensex up almost 3% at 10,930.09 at the end of the day's trade.\n\n=== Rescue and relief operations ===\n\n* Initial rescue efforts were hampered by the heavy rains and the prevalent monsoon flooding, but quickly took momentum after fellow passengers and bystanders helped victims to reach waiting ambulances and\/or provided first aid.\n* Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh announced ex-gratia payments of Rs\u00a01,00,000 (approximately US$2,200) to the next of kin of those who died in the explosion. The injured would be given Rs\u00a050,000 (approximately US$1,100) each.\n* Indian Railways announced Rs\u00a05,00,000 (approximately US$10,000) compensation and a job to the next of kin of those killed in the serial blasts in Mumbai. The announcements were made by Railways Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav after visiting those injured in the blasts at a hospital in Mumbai.\n\nHowever a study commissioned by former MP Kirit Somaiya noted that only 174 of the 1,077 victims had received compensation through the Railway Claims Tribunal. For the handicapped victims, only 15 out of 235 eligible cases had been taken care of. Regarding the Prime Minister's promise to India concerning the rehabilitation of the victims, L. K. Advani noted that \"none of the above mentioned assurances has been fulfilled to any degree of satisfaction\"\n\n=== Sources of information ===\nDue to the mobile phone networks being jammed, news channels ran tickertapes with information of injured individuals as well as SMS messages from those who wished to contact their families. Reports indicated that at around 18:00 UTC on 11 July (midnight in Mumbai), the phone networks were restoring service; telephone service was completely restored during the night.\n\nMumbai Help, a blog run by around thirty bloggers, was a useful source of information, especially for those outside India.\n\n== Investigation ==\n\n\nSome 350 people were detained 36 hours after the incident in Maharashtra\u00a0\u2014 police claim that these are people rounded up for investigations. On 14 July, Lashkar-e-Qahhar, a terrorist organisation possibly linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), claimed responsibility for the bombings. In an e-mail to an Indian TV channel, the outfit says it organised the bombings using 16 people who are all \"safe\". According to the e-mail, the main motive seems to have been a retaliation to the situation in the Gujarat and Kashmir regions, possibly referring to the alleged oppression of Muslim minorities in certain parts of the region. It also says that the blasts were part of a series of attacks aimed at other sites such as the Mumbai international airport, Gateway of India, the Taj Mahal in Agra and the Red Fort in New Delhi. The authorities are investigating this claim and are trying to track the location of the e-mail sender. However, on 17 July, the forensic science laboratory Mumbai has confirmed the use of a mixture of the highly explosive RDX and Ammonium Nitrate for the bombings. The presence of these explosives in the post explosive debris was confirmed by modern techniques such as Liquid Chromatography with mass detector (LCMS), Gas Chromatography with mass detector (GCMS) and Ion Scan Chromatography. They have indicated a strong possibility of all explosives being planted at the Churchgate railway station, which was the starting point for all affected trains.\n\nInitially, religious extremists from the Lashkar-e-Taiba and the banned Students Islamic Movement of India terrorist groups, and Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI were the prime suspects. Both Lashkar and SIMI denied responsibility for the bombings. There was also evidence about the involvement of the international Islamic terrorist group Al-Qaeda following a phone call from a man claiming to be a spokesperson for the group on 13 July. The alleged al-Qaeda spokesman had said the blasts were a \"consequence of Indian oppression and suppression of minorities, particularly Muslims.\"\n\nOn 30 September 2006, CNN reported that \"The Indian government accused Pakistan's military spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence, of planning the 11 July Mumbai train bombings that killed 209 people\". \n\nThe New York City Police Department was intensely concerned about the attacks, citing their simplicity and lethality. To address these worries, the department deployed Brandon del Pozo, a Jordanian-based intelligence officer, to Mumbai to collect information on the attacks and report on ways they reflected similar vulnerabilities in the New York City's extensive commuter rail system.\n\n=== Arrests ===\nOn 21 July 2006, police arrested three people suspected to be involved in the bombings. Police have detained more than 300 suspects since 18 July but these are the first arrests in the case. Two of the men were detained on Thursday in the northern state of Bihar and the third later in Mumbai. All three are said to belong to the banned SIMI organisation.\n\nOn the same day, Abdul Karim Tunda was thought to be arrested in Mombasa, Kenya on suspicions of involvement in the train bombings. but it was the wrong person. He was one of India's most wanted men and also a suspected organiser for the banned Islamic terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba. He was arrested in 2013 near the Nepal border.\n\nIn late 2006, all the seven key accused in the Mumbai train blasts in July retracted their alleged confession to the police, saying they were illegally forced to sign blank papers, an Indian TV channel reported.\n\n=== Continuing investigation ===\n\nM K Narayanan, the Indian National Security Advisor, has said that India doesn't have \"clinching\" evidence of the involvement of ISI in the Mumbai train blasts of 11 July.\n\n\"I would hesitate to say we have clinching evidence but we have pretty good evidence,\" he was quoted as saying on CNN-IBN.\n\nFollowing Narayanan's remarks, the Union Home Secretary V.K. Duggal on Monday characterised the evidence as \"very good [...] it is fairly solid evidence,\".\n5\nOn 25 September 2008, Hindustan Times reported that \"the Crime branch also learnt that the men [behind 2008 Delhi bombings] are those very operatives who had introduced themselves as Pakistanis to perpetrators of 11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings.\n\nJemaah Islamiyah is known to use pressure cooker bombs with RDX and like explosives with taggants.  Note that Jemaah Islamiyah had operatives in the Pakistan areas active in religious indoctrination and that were working with Egyptian Islamic Jihad through al-Zawahiri who taught on the use of pressure cooker bombs.  As such it is quite possible that Jemaah Islamiyah was involved in the attack possibly through Indian Mujahideen which it also forms part of.  Note that Jemaah Islamiyah was behind the 9-11 anthrax attacks as well.\n\n=== Involvement of Indian Mujahideen ===\n\nOn 27 February 2009, Sadiq Sheikh, an arrested leader of the Indian Mujahideen confessed to his alleged role in the bombings in a news channel broadcast. He claimed to have engineered the pressure cooker bombs with his associates in a flat in central Mumbai. If verified, these allegations could invalidate the previous claims by the ATS that the ISI or the SIMI were involved. Sadiq states in his confession, \u2018'All five of us arranged local first class train passes beforehand. We also had the local train time table with us so that we could choose a train as per our convenience. We purchased bags and pressure cookers in Bombay.'\u2019 He also claimed to have misled investigators by blaming the attacks on the Al-Qaeda.\nOn 6 April 2013, IM co-founder Sadiq Sheikh declared hostile witness by defence advocates.\n\n===Convictions===\nIn September 2015, 12 people were convicted in this case. On 30 September 2015, a special Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) court sentenced to death Faisal Sheikh, Asif Khan, Kamal Ansari, Ehtesham Sidduqui and Naveed Khan who planted the bombs in various trains.\n\nThe other seven convicts\u2014Mohammed Sajid Ansari, who prepared the electrical circuits for the bombs, Mohammed Ali, who provided his Govandi residence to make the bombs, Dr Tanveer Ansari, one of the conspirators, and Majid Shafi, Muzzammil Shaikh, Sohail Shaikh and Zamir Shaikh who provided logistical support \u2013 were sentenced to life.\n\n== Impact == \n=== Heightened security measures ===\n\nIn wake of the blasts, the Indian government tightened security in railway stations. Under new restrictions passed by the Ministry of Railways, non-passengers would no longer be allowed on the railway platforms after July 2006. Other major security steps include installation of close circuit televisions inside the stations for round-the-clock vigil and installation of metal detectors.\n\n=== Statements in response ===\n\n\nVarious senior political figures from India and around the world condemned the attacks. In India, Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh was quick to call for calm in Mumbai, while President Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, Railways Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav, and president of the Indian National Congress Sonia Gandhi also issued statements regarding the bombings in Mumbai. Officials from other nations offered their condolences to those affected by the bombings.  Officials, from Pakistan which has long feuded with India, and the United Kingdom, which was the target of similar attacks the previous July, were among those who denounced the attacks in Mumbai as well as terrorism as a whole. Several terrorist groups, including Lashkar-e-Toiba and al-Qaeda, made comments\u00a0\u2014 both in condemnation and condonation\u00a0\u2014 about the attacks as well.\n\n=== Memorial service === \nA memorial service was held in Mumbai on 18 July at 6:25\u00a0pm local time\u2014 exactly one week after the blasts. President Abdul Kalam, his hand raised to his forehead in salute, led the two-minute silence as people lit candles and placed wreaths at Mahim station, one of the seven places on the suburban rail network hit by bombs. Sirens sounded across Mumbai marking the memorial service. People gathered at the site of the blasts, in railway stations on the city's Western Line, traffic came to a halt, It interrupted films and observed a moment of silence to pay homage to the victims.\n\n==In popular culture==\n*The incidents that followed the bombings were used as details in the plot of the film, A Wednesday! (2008) starring Naseeruddin Shah, which was inspired by the train bombings. \n*The Hindi film Mumbai Meri Jaan (2008), which won multiple Filmfare Awards, deals with the aftermath of the Mumbai train bombings.\n*The movie The Train is a 2011 Malayalam thriller based on the bombings.\n\n== See also ==\n* Mumbai serial train blasts investigations- The official police investigations into the

{"title":"2007 Bikfaya bombings","article":"The 2007 Bikfaya bombings were two blasts on buses near Bikfaya, Lebanon which killed three people and injured 21 others. The bombings heightened tensions in the country following the Cedar Revolution, and on the eve of the two-year anniversary of the assassination of Rafic Hariri.\n\n==The bombings==\n\nOn Tuesday, February 13, 2007, a bomb exploded on a bus transporting 26 people from Bteghrine to the Lebanese mountain village of Ain Alaq. A second bus following behind stopped, and then a bomb on that bus exploded. Killed were Michel Attar (born 1989), Laurice Gemayel, and Mahmoud Hammoud, an Egyptian laborer. A further 21 other people were injured.\n\nThe two bombings occurred on the eve of a Cedar Revolution rally planned to commemorate the two-year anniversary of the assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri. The bombing occurred less than a mile from the Christian village of Bikfaya, the hometown of the former president, Amin Gemayel, whose son Pierre Gemayel, a cabinet minister and member of the anti-Syrian, March 14 Alliance, was assassinated by gunmen in November. Amin Gemayel, also a member of the March 14 Alliance, had just returned from the United States where he met with president George W. Bush in the White House on February 8, 2007. In addition to scaring the Lebanese from attending the Cedar Revolution the following day, many analysts also saw the bombings in Gemayel's stronghold of Metn as a Syrian warning to Gemayel who was a possible candidate for the Lebanese presidency. The bombings did not deter hundreds of thousands of flag-waving Lebanese, Christians, Muslims, and Druze, to gather in Martyr's Square in Beirut on February 14 to honor Hariri and show support for the anti-Syrian, pro-western government of Fouad Saniora.\n\n==Reactions==\n*Amnesty International condemned the bombings and accused the perpetrators of the attacks of \"showing complete disregard for the most fundamental principles of humanity.\"\n*Egypt condemned the bombings.\n*France condemned the bombings.\n*Germany condemned the bombings.\n*The United Kingdom condemned the bombings.\n*Indonesia condemned the killing, calling it an act of terror that would hinder political reconciliation among the Lebanese.\n*Prime Minister Fouad Siniora promised to pursue the criminals who murdered Attar, Gemayel and Hammoud. He believed that the terrorists were the same forces who assassinated Hariri in 2005. He said that the Lebanese will not be \"scared or terrorized\" and the terrorists will be brought to justice.\n*The leaders of the March 14 Alliance accused the Syrian government of committing the bombings in Ain Alaq to deter the Lebanese from participating in the rally honoring the second anniversary of Hariri's assassination.\n*The state-controlled media in Syria accused the March 14 Alliance and the anti-Syrian parliament majority of being behind the two bombings.\n*On February 15, 2007, The U.N. condemned the two bombings, and the Security Council agreed to provide Lebanon with technical assistance to help probe the bombing that killed Michel Attar, Laurice Gemayel and Mahmoud Hammoud.\n\n==Arrests and criminal charges==\nOn March 14, 2007, Lebanese Internal Security, better known as the S\u00fbret\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Liban, arrested four Syrians who confessed to the bombings in Ain Alaq. The Lebanese Interior Minister, Hassan Al Sabaa, believed that the four Syrians were members of a radical Palestinian group, Fatah al-Islam, which allegedly has close ties to the Syrian intelligence agency. However, it was still not clear who actually ordered the attack. Syria denied the Lebanese allegations.\n\nOn June 21, 2007, Lebanese State Prosecutor Saeed Mirza filed charges against 16 Fatah al-Islam suspects accused of carrying out the bombings. Nine of the 16 suspects accused were in custody when the charges were filed; other, including Fatah al-Islam head Shaker al-Abssi were still being sought. The defendants include 10 Syrians, two Lebanese, three Palestinians (including one woman) and one Saudi national.\n\n==See also==\n*2005 Lebanon bombings\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n* Fatah al-Islam background and information","urls":["http:\/\/www.dailystar.com.lb\/article.asp?edition_id=1&categ_id=2&article_id=79511","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/syria\/story\/0,,2012425,00.html?gusrc=rss&feed=12","http:\/\/www.dailystar.com.lb\/article.asp?edition_id=1&categ_id=1&article_id=79547","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2007\/02\/13\/us-lebanon-blasts-idUSL139283920070213","http:\/\/english.people.com.cn\/200702\/14\/eng20070214_350067.html","http:\/\/www.zawya.com\/Story.cfm\/DS140207_dsart24","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20070927001306\/http:\/\/www.zawya.com\/Story.cfm\/DS140207_dsart24","http:\/\/www.dailystar.com.lb\/article.asp?edition_id=1&categ_id=2&article_id=79587","http:\/\/www.gulf-times.com\/site\/topics\/article.asp?cu_no=2&item_no=133118&version=1&template_id=37&parent_id=17","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20070216233934\/http:\/\/www.gulf-times.com\/site\/topics\/article.asp?cu_no=2","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/middle_east\/6448535.stm","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2007\/02\/15\/us-lebanon-un-probe-idUSN1547114320070215","http:\/\/www.fatahislam.com\/news\/lebanese-prosecutor-21062007-charges.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20070626072603\/http:\/\/www.fatahislam.com\/news\/lebanese-prosecutor-21062007-charges.html"]}
{"title":"2007 Samjhauta Express bombings","article":"The 2007 Samjhauta Express bombing was a terrorist attack that occurred around midnight on 18 February 2007 on the Samjhauta Express, a twice-weekly train service connecting Delhi, India, and Lahore, Pakistan. Bombs were set off in two carriages, both filled with passengers, just after the train passed Diwana near the Indian city of Panipat,  north of New Delhi. 70 people were killed in the ensuing fire and dozens more were injured. Of the 70 fatalities, most were Pakistani civilians. The victims also included some Indian civilians and three railway policemen.\n\nInvestigators subsequently found evidence of suitcases with explosives and flammable material, including three undetonated bombs. Inside one of the undetonated suitcases, a digital timer encased in transparent plastic was packed alongside a dozen plastic bottles containing fuel oils and chemicals. After the bombing, eight unaffected carriages were allowed to continue onwards to Lahore with passengers.\n\nBoth the Indian and Pakistani governments condemned the attack, and officials on both sides speculated that the perpetrators intended to disrupt improving relations between the two nations, since the attack came just a day before Pakistani Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri was to arrive in New Delhi to resume peace talks with Indian leaders. There have been a number of breaks in the investigation of the bombing.\n\nIndia's National Investigation Agency (NIA) charged eight people in the terrorist attack, including Swami Aseemanand, a Hindu cleric formerly affiliated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. While Aseemanand has been released on bail, three persons charged in the case are absconding, and three others are in prison. The alleged mastermind, Sunil Joshi, was killed in 2007. In 2019, NIA court has acquitted all the accused.\n\nIt has been allegedly linked to Abhinav Bharat, a Hindu fundamentalist group in India. Other allegations also concurred on Lashkar-e-Taiba. A United States report declared Arif Qasmani to be involved in the attack. Consequently, after consulting with the United Nations, the United States declared him an international terrorist.\n\nQuestions were raised over a Pakistani national who was arrested after the bombings for not carrying valid papers and was seen as suspicious by the investigators, but was discharged within 14 days according to a statement of the first investigation officer assigned to the case. A court order had noted the statement of the police that no proof had been found against him, which was also stated later by one of the senior officers.\n\nA narco-analysis test was conducted on SIMI's leaders Safdar Nagori, Kamruddin Nagori and Amil Parvez who had stated about Abdul Razzaq's involvement in the blasts and him informing Safdar about it. Times Now had broadcast a video of the test in 2017. The later statements of Swami Aseemanand of Sunil Joshi telling him of involvement of his men in the blast had caused confusion for the investigators. One of the investigating officers stated in 2016 that they had investigated the Islamists including Safdar but didn't find them involved. Razzaq who had been in prison since 2005 had been interrogated and had brought Qasmani to the notice of Intelligence Bureau as a key Lashkar financier. He was questioned regarding the case, but no evidence of his involvement were found. Some officers had also questioned the reliability of narco-analysis.\n\n==Background==\n\nSince their formation resulting from the Partition of India in 1947, India and Pakistan have had a conflict-ridden relationship. In their plan for the partition, the British allowed all 565 princely states to decide which country they wanted to join. Most Hindu-majority princely states acceded to the Republic of India, while most Muslim-majority princely states joined the Dominion (now Islamic Republic) of Pakistan. The decision made by the leaders of some of these princely states has been a source of conflict and tension between the two countries. Kashmir is one of these princely states\u2014its population was mostly Muslim, but the Hindu ruler Hari Singh of the state decided to join India. The countries have fought four wars over this disputed region: the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 (resulting in the formation of Bangladesh), and the Kargil War in 1999. Since the 1980s, militants in Jammu and Kashmir have targeted attacks on civilians, members of the government and the Indian Army. Some groups, like the Islamist militant organisations Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, believe that Kashmir should be integrated into Pakistan, while others\u2014such as the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front\u2014believe it should become an independent state. All told, thousands of civilians have died due to the insurgency.\n\nIn recent years, the Indian and Pakistani governments have made attempts to bring peace or to at least calm the tensions between the countries. One such attempt in the peace process came with the launch of the Samjhauta Express, so-named because the word samjhauta means \"accord\" and \"compromise\" in Hindi and Urdu, respectively. This twice-weekly train service runs between Delhi and Attari in India and Wagah and Lahore in Pakistan. Launched in 1976, the Samjhauta Express served as the only rail connection between the two countries until the launch of the Thar Express. Given the nature of the transnational service and the ongoing violence in the region, the Samjhauta Express was always heavily guarded, as it was a high-risk target for terrorist attacks. Weeks after the Indian Parliament terrorist attack on 13 December 2001, the train service was discontinued amid security concerns. Although it resumed service on 15 January 2004, the train was placed on high security. Just days before the attack, Pakistani Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri announced that he was going to Delhi on 21 February 2007 to meet with Indian government officials to continue peace talks and to sign a nuclear risk reduction agreement.\n\n==Details==\n\nTwin blasts shook two coaches of the Samjhauta Express travelling between India and Pakistan at around 23:53 IST (18:23 UTC) on Sunday, 18 February 2007, shortly after the train had passed through the railway station in the village of Diwana, near the Indian city of Panipat. One railway employee manning the level crossing at the time stated:\nIt was about 11.52 when I showed the signal lantern to the Attari [Samjhauta] Express which was coming in very fast, probably at over 100\u00a0kilometers an hour (62.1\u00a0mph). Just as [it] reached near the home signal, I could hear two loud explosions from the coaches near the guards' van at the rear.\n\nAfter the explosions, both carriages were engulfed in flames and many passengers were incapacitated by the smoke. Witnesses claim to have seen passengers screaming and attempting to escape, but since most of the train's windows were barred for security reasons, many could not escape in time. The injured were pulled out of the burning carriages by fellow passengers and local residents.\n\nIn the end, the terrorist attack left 70\u00a0people dead and 50 injured. Most of the dead and injured were Pakistani nationals, though some Indians, including railway workers, were also killed. Initial identification of the victims was hindered by the fact that many of the bodies were charred beyond recognition. The rest of the train, which was left undamaged by the attack, continued on to the border town of Attari. There, passengers were transferred to a Pakistani train which took them to their destination in Lahore.\n\n==Reactions==\n\n===India===\n\nThe Indian government and media initially began pointing the finger at Pakistan for the terror attacks. Widespread condemnation of Pakistan ensued, particularly from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, and Pakistan was accused of harbouring terrorists and intentionally derailing peace attempts with India.  \nIndian Minister of Railways, Lalu Prasad Yadav, condemned the incident and went on to say that the attack was \"an attempt to derail the improving relationship between India and Pakistan.\"\nHe also announced compensation payments of Rs. 1,000,000 (approx. \u20ac17,500 or US$22,750) for the next-of-kin of each of the deceased and Rs. 50,000 for those injured.\nHome Minister Shivraj Patil claimed that \"whoever is behind the incident is against peace and wants to spoil our growing relationship with other countries\". Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed \"anguish and grief\" at the loss of life, and vowed that the culprits would be caught. India's foreign ministry also promised to issue visas for Pakistani relatives of those killed or injured in the blasts. Indian journalist Siddharth Varadarajan argued that the peace process should stay on track and that any wavering would be tantamount to surrendering to terrorism.\n\nThe opposition Bharatiya Janata Party condemned the attacks and petitioned the ruling Indian National Congress to ask Pakistan to comply with its 2004 promise to crack down on cross-border terrorism. The party also argued for a harsher anti-terror bill to take a \"zero tolerance\" approach to terrorism in India.\n\n===Pakistan===\nThe government of Pakistan reacted in the same vein, through its Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri, proclaiming that this was an act of terrorism that should be investigated by Indian authorities. Kasuri said that the terrorist attack would not halt his trip to India, as he \"will be leaving tomorrow for Delhi to further the peace process.\" He went on to say that \"we should hasten the peace process.\" In response to the terrorist attack, President Pervez Musharraf stated \"such wanton acts of terrorism will only serve to further strengthen our resolve to attain the mutually desired objective of sustainable peace between the two countries.\" Musharraf also said that there must be a full Indian investigation of the attack. In regards to the upcoming peace talks, he stated \"we will not allow elements which want to sabotage the ongoing peace process to succeed in their nefarious designs.\"\n\n===Others===\nIn the United Kingdom, Foreign Office minister Kim Howells condemned what he termed \"utterly shameful\" attacks, offered his \"condolences to the family and friends of those killed and injured\", and offered \"the Governments of India and Pakistan whatever assistance they require, to bring to justice the perpetrators of this brutal attack.\" Leaders in the British Pakistani community called the terrorist attack a \"despicable act\" and urged for a speedy investigation into the tragedy so that those responsible could be arrested and jailed.\n\nIn the United States, the Bush administration condemned those responsible for the bomb explosions aboard the Samjhauta Express. On behalf of the United States government, White House spokesman David Almacy stated:\nWe express our deepest sorrow for this tragedy and extend condolences to the families of the victims. We appreciate the leadership of Indian Prime Minister (Manmohan) Singh and Pakistani President (Pervez) Musharraf, and condemn those who seek to undermine the progress in relations between the two countries.\n\n==Tension==\nOn 23 February, a Pakistani Air Force C-130 plane landed, upon being granted approval, in New Delhi to evacuate Pakistanis injured in the train bombing. Of the ten people to be evacuated, three were missing, all from the same family. Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesperson, Tasneem Aslam, claimed that the father, Rana Shaukat Ali, was harassed by Indian intelligence agency personnel at the Safdarjung Hospital. Aslam also said that Pakistan High Commission officials were denied entrance into the hospital. An Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson, Navtej Sarna, denied these allegations and stated that the patients would be taken to the airport. Sarna told the press that Ali's family was not missing, and that hospital doctors had decided not to allow Pakistani officials access into the hospital. He also stated that the C-130 plane had developed a problem and could not take off. Later, Aslam told press correspondents that the \"[C-130] aircraft was still at the airport\" and that Mr. Ali had chosen to travel back to Pakistan via a land route. Despite the tensions between the two countries' External Affairs ministries, the C-130 aircraft took off from New Delhi at around 21:00 local time. After the incident, Ali criticised the media, who asked him for \"stories for their publications at a time when I am not in my senses because of the death of my five children.\" He also stated that Indian officials showed him sketches of suspects, but he could not identify them.\n\n==Investigation==\nThe day after the bombing, Indian police stated that the suitcase bomb attack was the work of at least four or five people with a possible militant connection. The police also released sketches of two suspects who the police Inspector General said had left the train just fifteen minutes before the explosions. The police say that one of the men was around 35 or 36\u00a0years old, \"plumpish\" and dark, with a moustache, and the second was around 26 or 27, wearing a scarf wrapped around his head. The police also stated that both men were speaking Hindi. Another man, a Pakistani national who was drunk at the time, was being questioned because he said he threw one of the bomb-containing suitcases off the train. A senior Haryana state railway police official said that the man's \"account has been inconsistent and we have no definite conclusions yet.\" Later, the Inspector General said \"the suitcase was thrown on the track\" and that the Pakistani national \"was there and said he had thrown it.\"\n\nIn early March, Haryana police arrested two people from the city of Indore who allegedly sold the suitcases used in the bombing. No charges were pressed on the individuals. A probe conducted by the commissioner of Railway Safety officially determined that the explosions and fire on the Samjhauta Express had been caused by bombs located in the upper compartments in coaches GS 03431 and GS 14857. The probe also showed that the train slowed to a speed of  just before it was going to pass the Diwana train station. The results strengthened the belief that the suspects got off the train before the explosions. On 31 March, a 25-year-old man was interrogated after being arrested in Amritsar after jumping off a moving train under suspicious circumstances.\n\n===Later developments===\nNo major developments took place in the investigation since late March 2007. Meanwhile, the Indian and Pakistan governments agreed to a bilateral pact to extend passenger train and freight services between the two countries until 2010. In late April, the Indian and Pakistan governments initiated steps for safety and security measures for the Samjhauta Express. The two countries started sharing information on passengers travelling on the trains. The train is now under a reservation system, and as one Railway Ministry source said, \"[w]ith no unreserved coaches, we now have complete passenger details from their ticket reservation data a few hours prior to their boarding, and departure of the train.\" Also in late April, three new coaches equipped with India's most advanced fire fighting systems were added to the Samjhauta Express. Indian Railway Ministry sources commented that the system acts with brake pressure, and this glass-encased system could throw water up to . Indian and Pakistani members of the Anti-Terror Mechanism (ATM) group met on 22 October 2007 to update each other regarding the status of the investigation.\n\nIn November 2008, it was reported that Indian officials suspected the attacks were linked to Lt. Col. Prasad Shrikant Purohit, an Indian army officer also alleged member of Hindu nationalist group Abhinav Bharat. Purohit himself claimed that he had \"infiltrated\" the Abhinav Bharat and he was only doing his job. During an army's Court of Inquiry as many as 59 witnesses stated to the court that Purohit was doing his job (of gathering intelligence inputs) by infiltrating extremist organizations. Officers have testified that he was doing what he was asked to do as a military intelligence man.\n\nInvestigators concluded that the suitcases used to make the suitcase bombs originated from Indore in India, based on their stitching. Indian officials said they were prepared to share their findings with Pakistan.\n\nIn January 2010, Pakistan Interior Minister Rehman Malik accused India of not pursuing the case seriously, and of refusing to divulge details about the role of Lieutenant Colonel Shrikant Purohit. Malik alleged that Purohit had hired Pakistani extremists to carry out the bombing. In October 2010, an 806-page chargesheet prepared by the Rajasthan anti-terrorist squad revealed that the Samjhauta Express had been discussed as a potential target for an attack at a meeting of Hindutva bomb makers in February 2006; the group subsequently travelled to Indore.\n\nOn 30 December 2010, National Investigation Agency claimed that they have solid evidence that Swami Aseemanand was the mastermind behind the blasts. He had roped in Sandeep Dange, an engineering graduate, and Ramji Kalsangra, an electrician, to build the improvised explosive devices used in the blasts. On 8 January 2011, Aseemanand confessed that Saffron terror outfits were behind the bombing of Samjhauta express, a statement his council later stated was obtained under duress. Later RSS sent a legal notice to CBI accusing it for deliberately leaking Swami Aseemanand's confession in media. RSS spokesman Ram Madavh called the investigation maligning of organisations and individuals. However, in late March 2011, Aseemanand came out and stated: \"I have been pressurised mentally and physically by the investigating agencies to confess that I was behind these blasts.\" Aseemanand was charged on 20 June 2011 for planning the blast. In November 2011, Indian High Courts issued a stay notice to the National Intelligence Agency on the point that Aseemanand was tortured and coerced in prison and on the allegations that the investigation agency itself was biased by its association to the United Progressive Alliance government In early 2012, commentators started questioning the \"Hindu\" angle to the terror attacks, noting both the existence of an equally plausible \"Muslim\" angle and the near impossibility of proving any claims\n\nMany initial reports suggested that the prime suspects in the bombing were the Islamic groups Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, both of whom have been blamed for many high-profile bombings in the past. On 1 July 2009, the United States Treasury and UNSC placed sanctions on Lashkar-e-Toiba, and named Arif Qasmani as having played a role in the bombing. In 2009, Qasmani was hit with a travel ban and an asset freeze by the 1267 committee of the United Nations Security Council Qasmani, as of 2011, was still the United States' main suspect in the Samjhauta bombing.\n\nOn 12 February 2012, the National Investigation Agency of India arrested a suspect identified as Kamal Chouhan, former RSS worker from the Indore district in Madhya Pradesh and conducted intense questioning. According to sources, Chouhan had a possible role in planting the bomb in the train. Chouhan is believed to be a close aide of Ramji Kalsangra and Sandeep Dange, two key Indian suspects in the case on whom the agency has announced a cash reward of  1\u00a0million for information of their whereabouts.\nThe National Investigation Agency is likely to file a fresh chargesheet in a next couple of days which will name Kamal Chauhan and Amit Chauhan as the two alleged bombers who along with Lokesh Sharma and Rajendra Pehalwan allegedly planted the four suitcase bombs in the train.\n\nIn April 2016, Director General of NIA requested the United States government to provide information on LeT Key financier Arif Qasmani. The US charge sheet in 2009 accused Qasmani of funding the blasts. Later, in April 2016, NIA declared that Lt Col Purohit was never an accused in the case and there was no evidence of his involvement in the bombing.\n\nIn late-June 2017, Times Now and India TV reported that a Pakistani national Ajmat Ali who was a suspect in the case were discharged within 14 days based on the statements of Gurdeep Singh who was the first investigation officer assigned to the case which were also mentioned in a deposition to a court 12 days earlier. Al was arrested by Punjab police for not carrying valid papers and he was handed over to police of Haryana for interrogation. He was stated to match the description of the suspect who planted the bombs according to eyewitnesses and was accused of having used false identities by the police. Per a report, he had stated about undertaking reconnaissance of many prominent cities. He however was discharged by senior officials probing the case with the court order noting the police's statement that no proof had been found. Per India TV, top police officials in a meeting on 21 July 2010 had decided to hand over the investigation to NIA as Haryana Police failed to bring the case to any logical conclusion and had also decided to probe the role of Hindu groups. The Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad hinted the UPA government had planted the angle of role of \"Hindu terror\" and questioned the suspect's release.\n\nA report carried by The Hindu in July 2017 contained a statement of one of the senior officer Bharti Arora who had directed the suspect to be discharged, had headed the SIT at that time and was named by Gurdeep Singh in his statement, stated that his statement was being misread. She added that Ali was properly interrogated and discharged when nothing was found against him. She also stated that she would take legal action against the channel stating a sting report of letting-off the suspects in 14 days, for what she claimed was a \"false report\". NIA stated it would not investigate the claims about the case till court orders.\n\nThe Hindustan Times carried a report in September 2008 of statements from the narco-analysis test conducted on SIMI's extremist wing chief Safdar Nagori as well as other leaders who were Kamruddin Nagori and Amil Parvez. Safdar at the time was of the blast was in a hospital in Madhya Pradesh due to a fractured hand. Per reports of the test, he stated that Abdul Razzaq was involved in the blast and had informed him the blasts would be carried out with the help of a few Pakistani nationals. Kamruddin and Amil Parvez had stated that Razzak was close to Nagori, had informed him and discussed about the blasts. Safdar however denied any meeting was held to plot the blast. A video of Safdar's test was broadcast by Times Now in July 2017. Rediff carried a report in 2011 that the later statements by Aseemanand on Sunil Joshi telling him of his role in the blasts had caused confusion among NIA and both the testimonies were contrary to each other. Vikash Narain Rai, the former Haryana police officer who headed the SIT from 2007 to early 2010, told The Wire in June 2016 mentioned that the SIT's first suspect were Pakistan-based terror groups or organisations like SIMI, stating that they had investigated many Islamists including Nagori. He stated that it became clear they were not involved as investigations progressed.\n\nPer a report by The Indian Express Razzaq who had been in prison since August 2005 after being deported from Iran, was interrogated after Safdar's narcoanalysis and brought Qasmani to the attention of Intelligence Bureau as a Lashkar financier. Per diplomatic sources due to this a dossier was given with Qasmani's purported involvement to the United States which according to a note recording an informal meeting between the NIA probe team and FBI was the cause for sanctions by Treasury Department on him. Razzaq was questioned by Madhya Pradesh and Haryana Police regarding the blast, but no evidence of his involvement was stated to be found. Some police officers had also questioned the reliability of narcoanalysis, barred in USA and Europe, with a senior NIA officer stating that they had nothing but the statements of a man given under the effect of sodium pentathol.\n\nOn 20 March 2019, Special NIA court acquitted all four accused.\"The NIA Special Court has concluded that the investigating agency has failed to prove the conspiracy

The district is known to have a heavy Turkish military presence because due a military helicopter base, hospitals and military housings in the area. The explosion could be heard 3\u00a0km (two miles) away.\n\nThe attack occurred during rush hour.\n\n==Casualties==\nAccording to Bianet 7 people died in the attack, five were children who attended the school beside the site of the bombing. About 110 other people were wounded, eight people seriously.\n\n==Perpetrators==\nNobody has claimed responsibility for the blast, but authorities have blamed militants of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), whom Turkish security forces are fighting both in Turkey and in nearby Northern Iraq.

{"title":"2008 Tripoli, Lebanon bombings","article":"Bombings occurred in Tripoli, Lebanon on August 13 and September 29, 2008. Both attacks targeted military buses. \n\n==Background==\nBeginning in May, Tripoli saw some of its worst sectarian battles, pitting Sunni groups which support the Western-backed Lebanese Government against the Arab Democratic Party (ADP) of the city's Alawite community. ADP is a part of the opposition, and has close links to the Alawite-dominated regime in Damascus.\n\nA formal reconciliation was reached in September 2008, between the feuding factions in north Lebanon.\n\nRifaat Eid, the son of the leader of the ADP, accused Saudi Arabia of funding Salafi jihadists in Northern Lebanon, blaming them for the violence. \"The Salafis are like kittens when they are weak, but when they are strong they are like tigers.\" Salafist leaders in Tripoli insisted that the threat of jihadist militancy is exaggerated. Sheikh Omar Bakri, a Salafist preacher, said \"They say we are fanatics and cite what is happening in Iraq, but this is just propaganda to weaken the Sunnis in Lebanon.\"\n\n==Bombings==  \nOn August 13, a bomb in a briefcase on a bus carrying Lebanese Army soldiers killed 15 people including 10 soldiers. Two days previously there was another attack, this one a bombing in neighbouring Syria. There was a quick chorus of condemnation and denunciation from local politicians, who said it was targeted at the army. Former Prime Minister of Lebanon Najib Mikati told a local radio station: \"This is a direct targeting of the military institution.\"\n \nIn August, Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian President, gave a warning that Islamic extremists were destabilising Northern Lebanon. Later, at the beginning of September, thousands of Syrian troops deployed along the Lebanon-Syria border, triggering fears in Beirut of a possible military incursion.\n \nOn September 29, 2008, a car bombing occurred in Tripoli, Lebanon, targeting a military bus carrying soldiers, killing 7 and injuring 30 people. Lebanese officials said the blast came from a car parked by a busy roadside and was detonated by remote control.\n \n==See also==\n*List of terrorist incidents in 2008\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/www.ynetnews.com\/articles\/0,7340,L-3603955,00.html<\/ref>","http:\/\/english.aljazeera.net\/news\/middleeast\/2008\/09\/200892951350653451.html<\/ref>","http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/hasen\/spages\/1025405.html<\/ref>","http:\/\/www.albawaba.com\/en\/countries\/Lebanon\/236375<\/ref>","https:\/\/nytimes.com\/2008\/08\/14\/world\/middleeast\/14lebanon.html","http:\/\/www.timesonline.co.uk\/tol\/news\/world\/middle_east\/article4846164.ece<\/ref>"]}
{"title":"2011 Mumbai bombings","article":"The 2011 Mumbai bombings  were a series of three coordinated bomb explosions at different locations in Mumbai, India, on 13 July 2011 between 18:54 and 19:06 IST. The blasts occurred at the Opera House, at Zaveri Bazaar and at Dadar West localities, leaving 26 killed and 130 injured.\n\n==Timeline and damage==\n\n\n\n\nThe first device was planted on a motorcycle at Khau Gali in south Mumbai's Zaveri Bazaar and exploded at 18:54 local time. The second device, planted in a tiffin box outside Prasad Chambers and Panchratna Building, in the Opera House area on Charni Road, exploded at 18:55, the area of workplaces of 5,000\u20136,000 people connected with the diamond-trade industry. The third device was placed on an electric pole at the Dr Antonio Da Silva High School BEST bus stand near Kabutar Khana in Dadar area and exploded at 19:06.\n\nFollowing the blasts, phone lines were jammed and communications ceased or were available intermittently for at least a few hours. Other metropolitan cities, including Delhi, Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore, were also put on high alert. Immediately after the blasts, the Mumbai Police sent an SMS to a few mobile phone users in Mumbai reading,\n\n\n\nMost of the injured were rushed to various hospitals in Mumbai, such as J.J. Hospital, St. George Hospital, Hurkisondas Hospital and G. T. Hospital.\n\nMumbai has been hit by terrorist incidents at least half a dozen times since the early 1990s, with over 600 people dying in these attacks. In an editorial, the Times of India described the city as having become a \"hot hunting ground for terror.\" A loss of Rs. 3\u00a0billion per day was reported at the closure of the Panchratna Building, after the blasts, where the people who lost their lives were mainly from the diamond industry, and at Zaveri Bazaar, were mostly goldsmiths. Rakesh Maria said that the Anti-Terrorism Squad (India), would soon release sketches of culprits, as the footage obtained from the closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras at Opera House site was under scrutiny.\n\n==Casualties and compensation==\n\n\nThe blasts claimed 26 lives and injured an additional 130 others.\n\nPrime Minister Manmohan Singh and Indian National Congress leader Sonia Gandhi visited Mumbai the next day and met with those injured in blasts at Saifee Hospital. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced a compensation of 2,00,000 to the kin of each of those killed and  to the seriously injured. Meanwhile, the Maharashtra Government also announced  in compensation to the families of each of those killed and about 50,000 to the injured.\n\n==Investigations==\n\n===Speculations===\nThere was speculation that the pattern of the blasts suggested involvement of Indian Mujahideen (IM). According to the Delhi Police, Indian Mujaheddin has been conducting blasts on the 13 or 26 of the month.  Speculation was also rife that the hard-line Taliban Mumbai underworld could be behind these blasts, in the light of the killing of journalist Jyotirmoy Dey, as well as the attempted assassination of Dawood Ibrahim's brother, Iqbal Kaskar on 3 May 2011. The day 13 July is also observed as Kashmir Martyr's day, and there could be a possibility that the attacks were carried out by Kashmiri groups. There is also a view that the attacks could have been plotted by those trying to derail the Indo-Pakistani peace process.\n\nThe slain MiD DAY crime journalist Jyotirmoy Dey had previously reported that a huge cache of 35 detonators, gelatin sticks and large quantity of ammonium nitrate explosives had been seized on 20 May 2011 from Umarkui and Sayli village in Silvassa. Ammonium nitrate, gelatin and detonators have been used in several bomb blasts in Mumbai previously. The report also mentioned that this cache had gone missing soon after local police took custody. The journalist had also speculated that the cache might be used to trigger terror attacks in the city. There were calls for further investigations into this link to the Mumbai blasts by his employer MiD DAY.\n\n===Timeline of investigations===\nThe Home Ministry classified the bomb blasts as a terrorist act and dispatched a National Investigation Agency (NIA) team to the bomb site. The Chief Minister of Maharashtra Prithviraj Chavan said that the bombs used could have been fuel filled, much like molotov cocktails. Preliminary investigations suggested the use of multiple IED explosives in the blasts with ammonium nitrate-based explosives mixed with fuel oil. The explosives indicate some level of sophistication. It is also believed that remote detonators may have been used, with two of the three blasts being high-intensity. The Home Minister also announced that his office would be updating the people through the media every two hours.\n\nThe Maharashtra ATS was reported to have sought a list of passengers travelling from Kolkata to Mumbai and Kolkata to Kanpur from the Kolkata Police. The suspicions were a result of a Kolkata man with Indian Mujahideen link having gone missing in the previous few days. A NIA team visited Ahmedabad on 15 July 2011 to meet an Indian Mujahideen suspect who was arrested by the Crime Branch in connection with the 2008 Ahmedabad bombings. On 16 July, Maharashtra ATS Chief Rakesh Maria said that, based on forensic opinion and visit to the various sites, the possibility of a suicide bomber was being ruled out. However, a sketch of a possible suspect based on CCTV footage from one of the blast sites was being prepared. He added that in light of the sensitive nature of the investigation, the entire detail of the probe could not be revealed at that particular stage.\n\nOn 4 August, Home Minister P. Chidambaram suggested indications of involvement of a home-grown terror module in the blasts.\n\nOn 9 August, the Maharashtra ATS arrested one person it claimed had stolen a bike used in the Zaveri Bazaar explosion. The bike had been stolen from one Amit Singh a few hours before the blasts. CCTV footage showed one person with long hair riding a stolen red colour Honda Activa, entering the crowded lane, taking two left turns, placing the scooter at the spot of the explosion and walking off.\n\nOn 23 January 2012, the Mumbai Police claimed that it had solved the Mumbai Blasts case with the arrests of two suspects \u2013 Naqi Ahmed Wasi Ahmed Sheikh (22) and Nadeem Akhtar Ashfaq Sheikh (23) \u2013 hailing from Darbhanga district of Bihar. The Mumbai Police's ATS claimed that the two had stolen two scooters used in the blasts according to a scheme whose logistics were managed by Yasin Bhatkal, the mastermind of the blast. However, this televised announcement baffled the other intelligence agencies. It was later revealed that Naqi Ahmed was assisting the Delhi Police and other central intelligence agencies in tracking down two other perpetrators of the blast. Further investigations revealed that the two Pakistani bombers, named Waqqas and Tabrez, staying in Byculla used as many as 18 SIM cards and six handsets. The duo received sim cards from the co-accused Naqi Ahmed, who was arrested by the ATS in January 2012 for possessing SIM cards obtained with fake documents, following which Naqi admitted his role in the blasts and also admitted working with Indian Mujahideen's founder member Yasin Bhatkal in arranging accommodations for the bombers.\n\nOn 25 May 2012, Maharashtra ATS filed a chargesheet against Naqee Ahmed, Nadeem Shaikh, Kanwar Pathrija and Haroon Naik (all are under arrest). Additionally, the chargesheet named six others including Indian Mujahideen mastermind Yasin Bhatkal and Riyaz Bhatkal, Waqas Ibrahim Sad, Danish alias Tarbez, Dubai based Muzaffar Kolah and Tehseen Akhtar as wanted accused on the run.\n\nOn 4 February 2014, Maharashtra ATS was handed over the custody of Indian Mujahideen mastermind Yasin Bhatkal for probing the 2011 Mumbai Bombings Case.\n\nOn 16 July 2014 Mumbai ATS arrested Abdul Mateen Fakki from Goa\u2019s Dabolim Airport, while he arrived from Dubai by flight. He is accused of financing the terrorist operation by passing money through Hawala sources to Indian Mujahideen co-founder Yasin Bhatkal.\n\n===Allegations of police brutality===\nThe Mumbai Police detained several men for questioning. One of those detained\u2014Faiz Usmani\u2014died while in police custody on 17 July, sparking allegations of police brutality. Usmani was the brother of one of the accused in the 2008 Ahmedabad bombings case. It was alleged by his family members that Faiz Usmani was healthy when the police picked him up and that he was subjected to torture in police custody. The police dismissed these charges and countered that Usmani was suffering from hypertension and complained of giddiness after walking himself into a police station. He was admitted to the Lokmanya Tilak hospital, Sion, Mumbai, following which he died quickly due to blood clots in brain and a heart attack. A CID probe was ordered into Usmani's death.\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn the wake of the blasts, Boeing announced that the Boeing-787 Dreamliner, which was on its maiden visit to India, would skip the Mumbai leg of the trip. An official said that it would have been insensitive to take the plane to Mumbai at this time when such a tragedy had occurred and that the decision had also been taken in view of security concerns and so as not to put added pressure to provide extra cover for the aircraft.\n\nChief Minister of Maharashtra Prithviraj Chavan revealed a plan by the Maharashtra government for a future use of satellite phones and the development of a secure communication network so that the administrative functioning is not affected during such crises as a result of network problems. He also reiterated the need to expedite the procurement of police modernisation equipment and the installation of CCTV cameras at prominent places in the city. Following the Mumbai terror attacks the Directorate General of Shipping (DGS) banned the use of Thuraya & Iridium satellite phones and infrastructure. Restrictions were already in place in 2010, for similar reasons, under provisions in the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.\n\n==Reactions==\n\n===Domestic===\nPresident Pratibha Patil and Vice-President Hamid Ansari expressed their shock and condemned the attacks in Mumbai. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also condemned the bombing, and called on Mumbai citizens to remain calm and show unity. Other politicians, such as Sonia Gandhi, chairperson of the Indian National Congress and Nitin Gadkari of the BJP expressed their anger and offered condolences to the families of the bombing victims. Senior BJP leader L K Advani visited Mumbai on 14 July and stated that the repeated attacks in Mumbai prove policy failure on part of the government. The Left parties (CPI and CPI (M)) strongly condemned the Mumbai serial blasts and rued the government's inability to track down the perpetrators of recent terror strikes. Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan said that this was an attack on the heart of India. Home Minister P. Chidambaram left Delhi for Mumbai on the same night and visited the three blast sites, met the injured in the hospitals, and interacted with the family members of the dead.\n\nLocal politician, Manohar Joshi of the Shiv Sena, urged the government to \"take immediate steps and find out who are people behind the blasts.\"\n\nINC general secretary Rahul Gandhi remarked that it was impossible to stop every terror attack. He said that 99 per cent of terror attacks had been prevented in the country thanks to various measures, such as improved intelligence collection efforts. He added that \"We work towards defeating it, but it is very difficult to stop all the attacks. Even the United States, they are being attacked in Afghanistan.\". His comments drew flak from some quarters of the Indian political spectrum, who criticised him for equating the Mumbai attacks with those in Afghanistan and called it an insult to those killed in the blasts.\n\nChairman of the moderate Hurriyat faction Mirwaiz Umar Farooq condemned the Mumbai blasts saying such incidents are orchestrated to derail the dialogue process between India and Pakistan and that those involved in the killing of innocent people 'are enemies of humanity'. In a statement, he said \"We are saddened by the huge loss of life in the Mumbai blasts and condemn it. Spilling the blood of innocents, be it in Mumbai, Palestine, Karachi or Kashmir, is a shameful and inhuman act.\"\n\n===International===\n\n====Organisations====\n* A statement issued by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's office read: \"The Secretary-General condemns the attacks that have killed and injured many in Mumbai,\" said a statement from his office. \"No cause or grievance can justify indiscriminate violence against civilians. The Secretary-General expresses his solidarity with the Government and people of India, and extends his sincere condolences to the families of the victims,\" it added.\n:A statement read by Peter Wittig, Germany's ambassador to the UN and current United Nations Security Council President declared that \"the members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation.\" In a deviation from the language used by the Security Council in its condemnations of other such attacks, this press statement did not contain the Security Council's usual admonition to member states that they must ensure that measures taken to combat such incidents, comply with all their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, prompting some observers to comment that this was a result of India's growing clout in the premier body.\n* European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton's office released a statement that read: \"(Ashton) was horrified to hear that Mumbai has again been the target of a series of deadly bomb attacks. She condemns these heinous acts and expresses her condolences to the families and friends of the victims. It is essential that the perpetrators these evil attacks are brought to justice,\" stated a release issued by her office.\n* Secretary General of NATO Anders Fogh Rasmussen expressed deepest sympathies to the victims of the terrorist attacks in heavily populated areas of Mumbai. He condemned in the strongest possible terms the indiscriminate violence and the senseless loss of innocent lives.\n\n==See also==\n* 25 August 2003 Mumbai bombings\n* 2008 Mumbai attacks\n\n==Notes==\n\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n\n*  Photos.

{"title":"2013 Baghdad Christmas Day bombings","article":"On 25 December 2013, three bombings occurred in two locations in Baghdad, Iraq. They targeted Christians, killing 38 people and wounding 70 others. \n\n==Bombings==\nTwo bombs first exploded simultaneously in an outdoor market in the Christian section of Athorien in Baghdad. The market attack killed 11 people and wounded 14 others.\n\nA few minutes later, about half a mile away, a car bomb went off near St. John's Roman Catholic Church in Baghdad's southern Dora neighborhood. According to officials, \"The bomb detonated at the end of Christmas prayers as worshippers were leaving the church.\" This bombing killed 27 and wounded another 56.\n\nIn total, the bombings targeting the two Christian-populated sites killed 38 and wounded 70. No group claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\n==Reaction==\n* The United States Embassy in Baghdad condemned the attacks in a statement: \"The Christian community in Iraq has suffered deliberate and senseless targeting by terrorists for many years, as have many other innocent Iraqis.

{"title":"2014 Mubi bombing","article":"On the evening of 1 June 2014, a bomb was set off at a football field in Mubi, Adamawa State, Nigeria. At least forty people were killed in the attack, according to eyewitnesses. Nineteen others were injured. The perpetrators of the attack were not clear, although media reports generally blamed Boko Haram.\n\n== Background ==\n\nMubi is located a few miles from the Cameroon\u2013Nigeria border. It is one of three towns in northeastern Nigeria that have been under a state of emergency for more than a year. Even so, Adamawa State's attacks by the Boko Haram insurgency include massacres in Mubi in 2012, 2014, 2017 and 2018.\n\nBoko Haram is an Islamist terrorist group opposed to what they perceive as the Westernisation of Nigeria, which they say is the root cause of criminal behaviour in the country. Thousands of people have been killed in attacks perpetrated by the group, and the federal government declared a state of emergency in May 2013 in Borno State in its fight against the insurgency. The resulting crackdown, however, has failed to stabilise the country.\n\nBoko Haram's attacks intensified in 2014. In February, the group killed more than 100 Christian men in the villages of Baga, Borno and Izghe, Borno. Also in February, 59 boys were killed in the Federal Government College attack in Yobe State. In April 2014, the group abducted more than 200 school girls on the same day as a bombing attack in Abuja killed at least 88 people. By mid-April, Boko Haram had been blamed for nearly 4,000 deaths in 2014. At least 500 more people have been killed since then.\n\nAfter the kidnapping, international attention on the situation greatly intensified. The United States, the United Kingdom, France, and other nations pledged monetary and\/or military support to combat Boko Haram. However, attacks continued. On 20 May 2014, 118 people were killed in a pair of bombings in Jos. The following day, two dozen people were killed in a raid on a village.\n\n== Attack ==\nAt approximately 6:30 pm local time (17:30 UTC), a bomb went off as spectators were leaving a football field in Kabang, Mubi. A number of shops were destroyed in the blast. One survivor described the scene: \"After the commotion, I stood up covered with my own blood, but I realized that I was lucky to be injured as those who were not that lucky were shattered into pieces.\"\n\nAccording to one eyewitness, the blast appeared to come from within a crowd of people walking across the field on their way home, possibly suggesting the attack was the work of a suicide bomber. However, other eyewitnesses said a car had delivered the explosives. A similar attack was attempted at a football field in Jos the previous weekend, but the would-be-suicide bomber blew up before reaching the target.\n\nInitial reports said 14 people were killed in the attack and 12 injured. The official death toll was upped to 18 with 19 injuries the next day. However, the actual death toll was much higher according to locals. A nurse said the morgue at the local hospital was \"overcrowded\" with 40 or more bodies; a police officer backed her report. An eyewitness who lost two family members said about 45 people had died.\n\n== Suspects ==\nMedia reports were quick to link the attack to Boko Haram. However, the area has also been subject to non-Boko Haram violence in recent years, so the perpetrators were not clear. On 2 June, a suspect was arrested by the military who had surrounded the city in hopes of catching the perpetrator. Eyewitnesses reported seeing the suspect's car at the scene of the bombing.\n\n== Reaction ==\nPoliticians including Adamawa State governor Murtala Nyako and the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, described the attack as barbaric. Nyako said the government was saddened by the attack, but called on citizens to remain calm and assist in the investigation. The military surrounded the town in an effort to catch those responsible for the attack.\n\n== References ==","urls":["http:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/world\/rest-of-world\/Bombing-at-northeast-Nigeria-football-match-kills-at-least-40-Police\/articleshow\/35925885.cms","https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/worldnews\/africaandindianocean\/nigeria\/10163942\/Extremist-attack-in-Nigeria-kills-42-at-boarding-school.html","http:\/\/www.theaustralian.com.au\/news\/world\/nigeria-school-attack-claims-42-lives\/story-e6frg6so-1226675417375","https:\/\/www.ctc.usma.edu\/posts\/aqims-threat-to-western-interests-in-the-sahel","https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/world\/2014\/04\/21\/parents-234-girls-kidnapped-from-nigeria-school\/7958307\/","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2014\/feb\/25\/boko-haram-kills-children-boarding-school","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140226141016\/http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2014\/feb\/25\/boko-haram-kills-children-boarding-school","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2014\/apr\/23\/200-girls-missing-nigeria-care-sewol-tragedy","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-africa-27498598","http:\/\/leadership.ng\/news\/373177\/mubi-attack-prayers-saved-perishing-bomb-attack-survivor","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140606221224\/http:\/\/leadership.ng\/news\/373177\/mubi-attack-prayers-saved-perishing-bomb-attack-survivor","http:\/\/en.starafrica.com\/news\/nigeria-army-arrests-sunday-bomb-suspect.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140606203517\/http:\/\/en.starafrica.com\/news\/nigeria-army-arrests-sunday-bomb-suspect.html","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2014\/06\/01\/us-nigeria-violence-idUSKBN0EC1V620140601","https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/one-arrested-nigeria-football-pitch-bombing-military-093351653.html"]}

{"title":"2015 Diyarbak\u0131r rally bombings","article":"The 2015 Diyarbak\u0131r rally bombings occurred on 5 June 2015 in Diyarbak\u0131r, Turkey during an electoral rally of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) at 17:55 local time. The bombing took place two days before the June 2015 general election and killed 5 supporters, injuring over 100.\n\nSuspicions as for the perpetrators still lie on ISIL.\n\nThe HDP, having been identified as a mainly pro-Kurdish party, had been targeted on numerous occasions prior to the bombing, with party offices being faced with arson attacks and vandalism. Two bombs had previously exploded in the HDP's Adana and Mersin branch offices, injuring three party activists. The HDP's Diyarbak\u0131r rally was due to take place on 5 June, which was the last day before the election in which rallies were allowed.\n\nTwo bombs exploded at the rally, just before the party's chairman Selahattin Demirta\u015f was scheduled to speak. Initial reports by Mehdi Eker, the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock, claimed that two people were killed and over 100 were injured, with the rally being disbanded following the incident. Initial reports that the explosions could have been caused by the transformers nearby were dismissed by Taner Y\u0131ld\u0131z, the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, who stated that an investigation by the Ministry revealed that the transformers had been tampered with from the outside.\n\nThe Prime Minister, Ahmet Davuto\u011flu, offered his sympathies with the wounded and called the bombing a 'provocation' just 48 hours before election day.\n\nA suspect known to be close to ISIL was arrested on June 6 in Gaziantep.\n\n==Background==\n\nPolitical violence in the run-up to the general election targeted all of the major contesting parties, with campaign offices, candidates, party vehicles and supporters all being subject to attacks and vandalism. The HDP in particular, having been identified as a mainly pro-Kurdish party, had faced attacks from Turkish nationalists. The party's co-chair Selahattin Demirta\u015f stated on 5 May 2015 that 41 HDP offices had been subject to arson attacks since the party's establishment. The HDP's Adana and Mersin branch offices were also bombed in May, injuring three party activists. The HDP frequently claimed that the political responsibility for attacks against their party lay with the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP), which Demirta\u015f argued had been causing political polarisation and inciting violence.\n\n==Bombing==\nWith Selahattin Demirta\u015f due to begin his speech, two separate bombs exploded within the crowd. Initial reports claimed that two supporters were killed in the initial blast, with two others succumbing to their injuries in hospital at later dates. Press reporters were divided on the number of injured supporters, with some stating that close to 100 were injured, some claiming that 184 were injured, some claiming that there were more than 200 and some even claiming that over 400 were injured. Announcements were made in both Turkish and Kurdish to attendees at the rally to make way for ambulances and to not succumb to provocations. The rally was subsequently abandoned.\n\n==Investigation== \nIt was alleged that the explosions could have come from the transformers nearby, though investigators from the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources later identified that the transformers had been tampered with from the outside. A new allegation pointed towards the use of fragmentation bombs thrown in dustbins in the area.\n\nThe Attorney General of Diyarbak\u0131r launched an official investigation into the attack shortly after the bombings, with the Governor of Diyarbak\u0131r forming a crisis meeting.\n\n==Perpetrators==\n* The HDP held the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) responsible, with a suspect being arrested in Gaziantep on June 6. The suspect, Orhan G\u00f6nder, was alleged to have actively participated in ISIL's war efforts and to have attended ISIL training camps in Syria.\n* On 20 July 2015 after a bombing took place in Suru\u00e7, \u015eanl\u0131urfa Province, an unidentified spokesman alleged that Orhan G\u00f6nder and the suspect in the Suru\u00e7 bombing, Seyh Abdurrahman Alag\u00f6z, were both part of an ISIL-linked terrorist cell named the 'Dokumac\u0131lar' (Weavers) that targets the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG).\n* An alleged militant from the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in July 2015 voluntarily turned himself in to the Turkish Gendarmerie in Kars and claimed that the PKK had staged the bombing by bringing suitcases filled with bombs to the scene of the electoral rally, hoping to increase the HDP's votes following the incident.\n\n==Reactions==\nThe Prime Minister of Turkey, Ahmet Davuto\u011flu, offered his sympathies to the wounded and said that the attack was a provocation. The main opposition leader Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu also claimed that the attack was a provocation. In a statement after the bombing, HDP chairman Selahattin Demirta\u015f claimed that the attack intended to destabilise the south-east and also claimed that Hezbollah and ISIL forces had entered Turkey.\n\n==See also==\n\n*2015 Suru\u00e7 bombing\n*2015 Istanbul suicide bombing\n*2013 Reyhanl\u0131 car bombings\n\n\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/beta.trtworld.com\/turkey\/turkish-police-diyarbakir-bomber-has-isis-connections-3064","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150802051551\/http:\/\/beta.trtworld.com\/turkey\/turkish-police-diyarbakir-bomber-has-isis-connections-3064","http:\/\/www.haberturk.com\/galeri\/gundem\/449575-hdpnin-diyarbakir-mitinginde-patlama-olay-yerinden-goruntuler","http:\/\/www.haberturk.com\/gundem\/haber\/1087495-hdpnin-diyarbakir-mitinginde-patlama-meydana-geldi","http:\/\/www.haberturk.com\/gundem\/haber\/1087511-basbakan-davutoglundan-patlama-aciklamasi","http:\/\/www.hurriyetdailynews.com\/hdp-rally-bomb-attack-suspect-arrested-in-turkeys-southeast.aspx?pageID=238&nID=83763&NewsCatID=509","http:\/\/www.radikal.com.tr\/politika\/hdpnin_kirsehir_mitingine_saldiri-1357984","http:\/\/www.radikal.com.tr\/politika\/demirtas_bugune_kadar_41_hdp_secim_burosu_yakildi-1350368","http:\/\/www.radikal.com.tr\/politika\/adana_hdpye_bomba_koyan_kisinin_eskali_tespit_edildi-1361319","http:\/\/www.amerikaninsesi.com\/content\/hdpye-mersin-ve-adanada-saldiri\/2775665.html","http:\/\/www.haberturk.com\/gundem\/haber\/1079862-patlama-sonrasi-selahattin-demirtastan-ilk-aciklama","http:\/\/www.todayszaman.com\/anasayfa_death-toll-from-bomb-blasts-at-hdp-rally-rises-to-4_386023.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150723221211\/http:\/\/www.todayszaman.com\/anasayfa_death-toll-from-bomb-blasts-at-hdp-rally-rises-to-4_386023.html","http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com.tr\/haber\/hdpnin-diyarbakir-miting-alaninda-patlama-2-olu-100-yarali","http:\/\/www.zaman.com.tr\/gundem_hdpnin-diyarbakirda-miting-yaptigi-alanda-patlama_2298496.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150723223221\/http:\/\/www.zaman.com.tr\/gundem_hdpnin-diyarbakirda-miting-yaptigi-alanda-patlama_2298496.html","http:\/\/www.ntv.com.tr\/turkiye\/hdpnin-diyarbakir-mitinginde-patlama,FzvtqGfdCUOgCqswTD15oQ","http:\/\/t24.com.tr\/haber\/diyarbakirdaki-saldirilari-gerceklestiren-kisinin-isid-militani-oldugu-iddia-edildi,299106","http:\/\/www.haberturk.com\/gundem\/haber\/1090174-selahattin-demirtastan-onemli-aciklamalar","http:\/\/www.hurriyet.com.tr\/gundem\/29613124.asp","http:\/\/www.ilk-kursun.com\/haber\/233270\/hdpye-oy-verenler-okuyun-bakin-kimlerin-pesinden-gittiginizi-gorun-4-kisinin-oldugu-hdpnin-diyarbakir-mitingine-valiz-dolusu-bombayi-pkk-yerlestirmis\/","http:\/\/www.sabah.com.tr\/gundem\/2015\/07\/22\/hdp-mitingine-bombayi-pkk-yerlestirdi","http:\/\/www.hurriyet.com.tr\/gundem\/29208014.asp","http:\/\/www.derginokta.com\/demirtas-diyarbakirda-hizbullah-silahlandirildi-kimin-kimi-vuracagi-da-belirlendi.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150723230150\/http:\/\/www.derginokta.com\/demirtas-diyarbakirda-hizbullah-silahlandirildi-kimin-kimi-vuracagi-da-belirlendi.html"]}

{"title":"American University of Afghanistan attack","article":"On 24 August 2016, attackers who are suspected members of the Taliban stormed the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul, Afghanistan using a car bomb and automatic weapons. Thirteen people were killed, including seven university students, one policeman, three security guards at the university, and a university professor  (Naqib Ahmad Khpulwak)Fifty to at least 53 people were injured, some critically. Three of the attackers were killed by Afghan Special Forces. This was the first direct attack on the university, although two professors were kidnapped just outside the university a few weeks prior.\n\n== Background ==\nAfghanistan had been experiencing a significant amount of terror attacks during the War in Afghanistan, including the large July 2016 Kabul bombing. In the past, incidents related to employees at the American University of Afghanistan include a terror attack on a restaurant in which around 21 people were killed, including two AUAF employees, and a kidnapping of two foreign professors by men dressed in Afghan National Police uniforms on August 7. American special forces later failed in an operation to try and rescue them.\n\nThe American University of Afghanistan was chartered in 2004 and established in 2006. It is an \"Independent, self-governing, not-for-profit university operating on the US liberal arts model\". It is Afghanistan's \"top institution for higher education\" with many foreign employees. It was started by Dr. Sharif Fayez and is supported by many prominent U.S. politicians.\n\n== Attack ==\nThe attack began at 19:03 during the evening classes at the university, when around 700 students were in attendance. The university was surrounded by a fortified wall. A truck filled with explosives was driven up to the wall and blown up, leaving a large hole in the wall. Two assailants then entered the compound, prompting employees and students to panic while fleeing and hiding. A nearly ten-hour-long siege then ensued, which lasted overnight. Hundreds of trapped students \"pleaded for help\" as an explosion followed gunshots, some sending messages on Twitter. Students used furniture in the classroom to barricade doors, with others making a \"mad scramble to escape through windows\" while pushing each other out, some from dangerous heights.\n\nAfghan National Army troops belonging to an elite unit led operations to secure the campus while exchanging gunfire with the assailants. United States led military coalition foreign troops assisted in the operations, including mentors from the Norwegian Special forces group Marinejegerkommandoen  to rescue the 200 students trapped inside the school. Associated Press and Agence France-Presse photographer Massoud Hossaini was stuck and wounded inside the university and tweeted updates, along with other reporters such as CBS producer Ahmad Mukhtar.\n\nDuring the chaos, seven university students, one policeman, three security guards at the university, and one university professor were killed. A guard from a neighboring vocational school for visually impaired people was also killed. Most people were killed from bullets that traveled through windows. At least 50 to at least 53 people were also injured.\n\n==Aftermath==                                                                                                                                                                                            \nThe Taliban was suspected to be behind the attack but has not yet claimed responsibility. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant is also a suspect.\n\nLaura Bush, a major supporter of the university, denounced the attack along with the U.S. State Department and offered her condolences. She also issued a statement.\n\nThe American University of Afghanistan temporarily closed indefinitely \"in the wake of the despicable terrorist attack on the university\". University President Mark English was interviewed on the American National Public Radio. The university also issued a statement: \n\n\nThe university reopened in March 2017.\n\n==See also==\n*List of terrorist incidents in August 2016\n*July 2016 Kabul bombing\n*September 2016 Kabul bombing\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/friendsofauaf.org\/the-lives-lost-at-auaf\/","https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2016\/08\/american-australian-kidnapped-afghanistan-kabul-160808102236525.html","https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2014\/01\/18\/world\/asia\/afghanistan-violence\/index.html","https:\/\/www.questia.com\/read\/1G1-355969463<\/ref>","http:\/\/www.highbeam.com\/doc\/1P2-35795281.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150329113825\/http:\/\/www.highbeam.com\/doc\/1P2-35795281.html","http:\/\/www.highbeam.com\/doc\/1A1-b8495ee57eb041f7826446d4f7c80aaa.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150329113822\/http:\/\/www.highbeam.com\/doc\/1A1-b8495ee57eb041f7826446d4f7c80aaa.html","http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/2016\/09\/08\/sources-us-forces-mounted-unsuccessful-mission-to-rescue-american-u-hostages-in-afghanistan.html","https:\/\/www.vg.no\/i\/0RbOM","https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/american-university-in-kabul-attacked-1472055164","http:\/\/www.adweek.com\/tvnewser\/cbs-news-producer-escapes-taliban-attack-on-university\/302730","http:\/\/www.arabnews.com\/node\/975521\/world","http:\/\/heavy.com\/news\/2016\/08\/isis-islamic-state-american-university-kabul-afghanistan-attack-taliban-al-qaeda-motive-dead-amaq-news-claim-statement\/","http:\/\/www.dallasnews.com\/news\/local-news\/20160825-laura-bush-denounces-cowards-who-attacked-american-university-of-afghanistan.ece","http:\/\/www.universityworldnews.com\/article.php?story=20160826150537432","https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2017\/03\/28\/asia\/kabul-american-university-reopens\/index.html"]}
{"title":"2017 Sinai mosque attack","article":"At 1:50 PM EET on 24 November 2017, the al-Rawda mosque was attacked by roughly 40 gunmen during Friday prayers. The mosque is located in the village of Al-Rawda east of the town of Bir al-Abed in Egypt's North Sinai Governorate. It is one of the main mosques associated with the Jaririya Sufi order, one of the largest Sufi orders in North Sinai. The Jaririya order is named for its founder, Sheikh Eid Abu Jarir, who was a member of the Sawarka tribe and the Jarira clan. The Jarira clan resides in the vicinity of Bir al-Abed. The attack killed 311 people and injured at least 122, making it the deadliest attack in Egyptian history. It was the second-deadliest terrorist attack of 2017, after the Mogadishu bombings on 14 October. The attack was universally condemned by many world leaders and organizations.\n\n== Attack ==\nAl-Rawda Mosque, which is located on Sinai's main coastal highway connecting the city of Port Said to Gaza, belongs to the local Jarir clan, of the Sawarka tribe, who follow the Jaririya (Gaririya) Sufi order\u2014an offshoot of the movement of Abu Ahmed al-Ghazawi, of the broader Darqawa order. The mosque is on the road between El Arish and Bir al-Abed. The mosque has a smaller zawiyah, a Sufi lodge, attached.\n\nAccording to local media, attackers in four off-road vehicles planted three bombs; the attackers used the burning wrecks of cars to block off escape routes. After their detonation, they launched rocket propelled grenades and opened fire on worshippers during the crowded Friday prayer at al-Rawda near Bir al-Abed. When ambulances arrived to transport the wounded to hospitals, the attackers opened fire on them as well, having selected ambush points from which to target them. Local residents quickly responded, bringing the wounded to hospitals in their own cars and trucks, and even taking up weapons to fight back.\n\n=== Casualties ===\n305 adults were killed in the attack, 27 children, and at least 122 other people were wounded. Many of the victims worked at a nearby salt factory and were at the mosque for Friday prayers.\n\n== Responsibility ==\nNo group claimed responsibility for the attack, although there were reports that the attack appeared to be the work of Islamic State's Wilayat Sinai branch. On 25 November, the Egyptian public prosecutor's office, citing interviews with survivors, said the attackers brandished the Islamic State flag.\n\nIslamist militants have been active in the Sinai since July 2013, killing at least 1,000 Egyptian security forces personnel. According to The New York Times, in January 2017 an interview of an insurgent commander in Sinai appeared in issue five of the Islamic State magazine Rumiyah, where the commander condemned Sufi practices and identified the district where the attack occurred as one of three areas where Sufis live in Sinai that Islamic State intended to \"eradicate.\" The community had been repeatedly threatened to refrain from Sufi practices.\n\nJund al-Islam, an al-Qaeda-linked jihadist group in Sinai who were formerly affiliated with ISIL, declared their innocence and condemned the attack on the al-Rawda mosque.\n\n== Reactions ==\nEgypt declared three days of national mourning following the attack. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said the attack \"shall not go unpunished\". The President also ordered the government to allocate funds for compensating families of the dead.\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood wrote on Twitter and Facebook that it \"condemns in the strongest words\" the attack and that those responsible should \"renounce extremism and violence\". Al-Azhar University, Egypt's oldest accredited university, issued a statement condemning the attacks, adding \"terrorism will be routed\".\n\nOne week after the attack, Grand Imam of al-Azhar Ahmed el-Tayeb, along with Grand Mufti Shawki Allam and Religious Endowments Minister Mokhtar Gomaa, performed Friday prayers at al-Rawda mosque.\n\nThe attack was widely condemned by the international community, with many world leaders issuing official statements and social media posts. Turkey declared one day of national mourning on 27 November.\n\nThe Supreme Council for Sufi Orders cancelled street celebrations of Mawlid throughout Egypt as a sign of mourning.\n\nThe Egyptian Organization for Human Rights strongly condemned the attacks, and weeks later issued a report that considered the massacre an attempt of genocide against the Sufi Muslim community of the Sinai Peninsula. EOHR also called upon the Egyptian government to provide adequate protection for minorities.\n\nA three-day opening of the border crossing into Gaza from Rafah, Egypt, scheduled for 25\u201327 November, was cancelled due to security concerns. The Cairo International Film Festival stated in a press release its intention to continue with the festival, and condemned the attacks.\n\nThe Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality building, the Library of Birmingham, the Kuwait Towers and the CN Tower were illuminated with the colors of the Egyptian flag as a sign of solidarity. The lights of the Eiffel Tower were extinguished as well. The Royal Hashemite Court flew the Jordanian flag at half-mast.\n\n=== Military response ===\nPresident el-Sisi vowed to respond with \"the utmost force\" and Egyptian authorities in the days immediately after the attack the Air Force claimed to have the pursued and destroyed of some of the militants' vehicles and weapons stocks.

{"title":"August 2017 Lahore bombing","article":"On 7 August 2017, a truck bombing occurred at Band Road in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. Two people were killed and 35 others were wounded. Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan is suspected to have perpetrated the attack.\n\n== Background ==\nLahore suffered several terrorist incidents in 2017. This attack came two weeks after a suicide bombing that claimed 26 lives, which followed a blast targeting a census team in April and a bombing that killed 13 people in February.\n\n=== Intelligence before the attack ===\nAccording to a news article published in Daily Dunya on 1 August, law enforcement agencies had diligently informed the Inspector General of the Punjab Police, Arif Nawaz, about the details and specific locations of the highly possible terror attacks.\n\nThe agencies passed on information that there were several facilitators and groups of banned outfits near fruit markets who were actively transporting explosive materials, weapons, suicide jackets and timing devices via trucks and secretly occupying several buildings where they plan terror activities, the report stated.\n\nWarning the police officials, the agencies said that the checkpoints near the fruit markets were not doing enough to ensure safety and security. The agencies directed them to carry out intelligence-based and combing operations in and around the target areas so that those who want to carry out the attacks in Punjab cannot do so easily.\n\n== Attack ==\nAt around 20:50 UTC+5:00, a truck loaded with fruit exploded, killing two and injuring 35 people. Injuries were caused by debris of the building that collapsed as a result of explosion. More than 100 vehicles near the explosion were also damaged. The roof of a nearby school collapsed. The explosion caused damage to an electrical transformer and consequently the electrical supply was suspended and the area of the explosion was darkened. People initially thought that the electrical transformer had exploded. The explosion left a 10-foot crater on the ground. Parts of the truck were found several hundred meters away from the site of the explosion.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAs the explosion occurred about 300 meters away from Rescue 1122's headquarters, Rescue 1122 teams began to take the injured to Mian Munshi Hospital and Moyo Hospital. Security officials cordoned off the area. The bomb disposal squad reached the site and discovered that 80 kilograms of explosive material was used.\n\nFollowing the attack, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) teams began their search operation. A few hours after the attack, a clash erupted between 7 terrorists and the CTD team in which 4 terrorists were shot dead while 3 others managed to flee in the dark. The terrorists were identified as Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan's militants.\n\n== Reactions ==\nCM Punjab Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack and directed the authorities to investigate it.\n\n== References ==","urls":["https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1347364","https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1325024\/4-pakistan-army-soldiers-slain-in-lahore-suicide-blast-targeting-census-team","http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1314549\/senior-police-officers-among-10-killed-as-suicide-bomber-strikes-lahore","http:\/\/e.dunya.com.pk\/detail.php?date=2017-08-01&edition=LHR&id=3279215_92441688","https:\/\/en.dailypakistan.com.pk\/pakistan\/lahore-blast-agencies-had-informed-ig-punjab-about-possible-terror-attack-in-fruit-market\/","https:\/\/www.dawn.com\/news\/1350328","https:\/\/tribune.com.pk\/story\/1476032\/many-feared-injured-lahore-blast\/","http:\/\/nation.com.pk\/national\/08-Aug-2017\/truck-blast-terrifies-lahore","https:\/\/en.dailypakistan.com.pk\/headline\/15-injured-in-blast-near-lahores-band-road\/","https:\/\/www.samaa.tv\/pakistan\/2017\/08\/four-terrorists-killed-in-ctd-raid-after-outfall-road-blast\/","http:\/\/dunyanews.tv\/en\/Pakistan\/400400-One-killed-39-wounded-in-truck-bomb-blast-in-Laho"]}

{"title":"Maidan Shar attack","article":"On 21 January 2019, in central Afghanistan, the Taliban attacked a military compound in Maidan Shar, killing officers of the Afghan National Directorate of Security. The Taliban attacked while engaging in the process of negotiating a truce with the United States. The attack began when an explosives-laden car rammed through a military checkpoint and onto the grounds of the compound, where the vehicle detonated. After the explosion, two gunmen entered the base and opened fire on Afghan soldiers, before the two were shot down. A senior official in the Afghan defense ministry said that 126 people were killed in the explosion. The Taliban claimed responsibility and stated that over 190 people were killed in the attack. The Afghan National Directorate of Security (NDS) reported that 36 military personnel were killed in the attack. Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack and said that the 'Afghan intelligence agency personnel were target of the attack'.\n\n==Attack==\nThe attackers rammed a vehicle filled with explosives through a military checkpoint and detonated it in the camp of the National Directorate of Security (NDS) forces training center in Maidan Shar, the capital of Maidan Wardak Province. Following the explosion, two to five Taliban gunmen entered the campus and shot at Afghan soldiers before being fatally shot during the clashes. According to the Defence ministry officials, the Taliban used a Humvee vehicle which they had taken from government forces to house the bomb. Wardak provincial council member, Abdul Wahid Akbarzai, claimed that the attackers had dressed in Afghan special forces uniform. The attack took place on the same day when Taliban representatives met Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. special envoy for Afghan peace talks, in Qatar. Sharif Hotak, a member of the provincial council in Maidan Wardak, said, \"the explosion was very powerful. The whole building has collapsed.\"\n\n==Casualties==\nLocal officials said that no official confirmation regarding the casualty toll of troops and NDS personnel had been made, adding that officials said not to discuss the figure with the media due to the fear of damaging morale. NDS reports showed 36 killed and 58 injured. Mohammad Sardar Bakhyari, deputy head of the provincial council stated at least 65 were killed in the military base. Another source in Maidan Wardak Province reported that more than 100 members of NDS were killed in the attack. Sharif Hotak said \"many more were killed\" and he saw bodies of 35 Afghan soldiers in the hospital. Hotak asserted that the government was hiding the casualty figures. Khawanin Sultani, a provincial council member, said the attack left over 70 wounded. Zabiullah Mujahid, spokesman of Taliban insurgents, claimed 190 people were killed in the attack.\n\n==Reactions==\nPresident Ashraf Ghani's office called the attackers \"enemies of the country\" and said that \"they killed and wounded a number of our beloved and honest sons\".\n\nBahram Ghasemi, a representative of Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, condemned the attack and expressed sympathy for the victims' families.\n\nThe Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, expressed condolences to the families affected by the attack.\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, President of Turkey, condemned the attack and expressed his condolences to Ghani.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan condemned the attack and said \"the United States stands with the people of Afghanistan, who seek a peaceful future and an end to the violence\".\n\n==Public uprising force==\nAfghan security officials claimed that the base, where the attack took place, was run by Afghan National Directorate of Security (NDS) to train 'public uprising forces', a pro-government militia. They claimed that the many men who were killed in the attack were members of the militia who they had been training. In the past, Afghan security officials have denied any relation with such militia and claimed that those militia are organic movements of locals who are staging 'uprising' against the Taliban. So for the first time, Afghan security officials acknowledged that they are supporting public uprising forces. Sharifullah Hotak, a member of Wardak provincial council, claimed that the base was used by NDS to train and equip members of public uprising forces. However, Afghan security officials claims were contradicted by Ghani, who claimed that only National Directorate of Security personnel were the target of the attack.\n\n==Aftermath==\nOn January 23, NDS said they killed the attack organiser along with seven militants in an airstrike. The Taliban rejected the NDS statement, describing it as \"propaganda\". Similarly, residents and local officials in the areas also contradicted Afghan security officials claims. Sharifullah Hotak, member of Wardak provincial council, claim that 6 civilians were killed in the airstrike.\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-afghanistan-attack\/taliban-attack-kills-more-than-100-security-personnel-in-central-afghanistan-defense-ministry-source-idUSKCN1PF0FC","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/01\/21\/world\/asia\/afghanistan-taliban-attack-intelligence-wardak.html","https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/afghanistan-taliban-attack-military-compound-maidan-shahr-wardak-us-peace-talks\/","https:\/\/www.dhakatribune.com\/world\/south-asia\/2019\/01\/21\/taliban-attack-kills-126-security-personnel-in-afghanistan","https:\/\/www.apnews.com\/7341cda9e36d44499338a835c5a7aca8","https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/world\/taliban-attack-on-military-base-kills-at-least-65-afghan-officials-say","https:\/\/www.indiatoday.in\/world\/story\/taliban-attack-on-afghanistan-military-base-kills-over-100-1436197-2019-01-22","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/01\/21\/world\/asia\/afghanistan-taliban-attack-intelligence-wardak.html","https:\/\/www.dailysabah.com\/asia\/2019\/01\/21\/more-than-100-afghan-forces-killed-in-taliban-attack","https:\/\/www.abc.net.au\/news\/2019-01-22\/taliban-attack-on-afghan-security-base-kills-more-than-100\/10735200","https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/world\/south-asia\/around-65-killed-in-taliban-attack-on-afghan-intel-base-local-official\/articleshow\/67637878.cms","https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2019\/01\/taliban-kill-12-attack-afghan-military-base-190121061133642.html","https:\/\/en.mehrnews.com\/news\/141770\/Iran-condemns-deadly-attack-on-Afghan-military-compound","https:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/latest\/422215-pm-imran-khan-offers-condolence-to-people-of-afghanistan-over-terror-attacks","https:\/\/www.business-standard.com\/article\/news-ani\/us-to-support-kabul-in-achieving-peace-reconciliation-post-wardak-attack-119012200930_1.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/01\/21\/world\/asia\/afghanistan-taliban-attack-intelligence-wardak.html","https:\/\/www.business-standard.com\/article\/news-ians\/mastermind-of-military-base-attack-killed-afghan-intelligence-agency-119012300931_1.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/01\/23\/world\/asia\/afghanistan-taliban-airstrike.html"]}

{"title":"Sanmatenga attacks","article":"The Sanmatenga attacks occurred on 8 September 2019 in the Sanmatenga Province, Burkina Faso. In the Barsalogho Department a vehicle transporting people and goods, that was returning from a market, drove over an improvised explosive device (IED). 15 passengers were killed and six were injured in the IED attack. Most of the victims were traders. Meanwhile, around 50km to the east, a convoy with vans carrying provisions for people displaced by fighting was attacked by gunmen. In this attack, 14 people were killed. It is unknown who carried out this attacks.\n\n== Background ==\nIn the aftermath of the 2011 Libyan Civil War, militant attacks have increased due to a large influx of weapons and fighters into the region. Neighbouring Mali faced conflict in Azawad that threatened to split the country. \n\nBurkina Faso also faced an uprising in 2014 leading to the downfall of President Blaise Compaor\u00e9 later that year. Burkina Faso is a member of the Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Partnership and its commitment of peacekeeping troops in Mali and Sudan has made it a target for extremists in the region. Until 2015, Burkina Faso had remained violence free despite violent events occurring in the northern neighbouring countries of Mali and Niger. Since then, jihadist groups linked to Al-Qaeda and Islamic State began their infiltration into the country from the northern borders followed by its eastern borders. The infiltration have also brought danger to the southern and western borders. Since 2015, Burkina Faso has faced cross-border attacks and sporadic raids in its territory, the result of instability and unrest in neighboring countries.\n\nSeveral major attacks have occurred in the capital Ouagadougou in recent years: In 2016, attacks on a hotel and restaurant killed 30 people, including foreigners; and in 2017, similar attacks killed 19 people, including foreigners. Both of these attacks were carried out by Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. On 2 March 2018, at least eight heavily armed militants launched an assault on key locations throughout Ouagadougou, the capital city of Burkina Faso. Targets included the French embassy and the headquarters of Burkina Faso's military. 16 people, including the eight attackers died in the incident that left 85 injured.\n\nIn 2019, the ethnic and religious tensions started due to the Islamist insurgency in Burkina Faso. The effect was more prominent in the northern areas of Burkina Faso bordering Mali. AFP reported that the Insurgents have combined hit-and-run tactics of guerrilla warfare along with the road side land mines and suicide bombings. Using these tactics, the insurgents have killed about 600 people. However the toll is estimated to be more than 1,000 by the civil society groups. AFP reported that the violence have displaced around 300,000 people and around 3000 schools were closed. The country's economy is largely rural and effect of violence is increasing on the economy. The violence has been causing disruption in the trade and markets. \n\n== Attacks ==\nThe attacks occurred on 8 September 2019 in the Sanmatenga Province, Burkina Faso. In the Barsalogho Department a vehicle transporting people and goods, that was returning from a market, drove over an improvised explosive device (IED). 15 passengers were killed and six were injured in the IED attack.

A district police official, Jan Agha, said the bomb was fixed in the mosque microphone which was used by the mosque imam, Mawlawi Samiullah Raihan.\n\nSamiullah Rayhan, 36, a father of four children, was an imam at Al-Taqwa mosque. He was a parliamentary adviser and the host of a daily religious television show. His support for the families of fallen Afghan soldiers, condemnation of the Taliban\u2019s suicide bombings, women\u2019s rights, and cooperation between Western military forces and the Afghan government were the main reasons for being targeted in the attack. Firdaws Faramarz, a police spokesman said, the bomb explosion happened near the altar of the Al-Taqwa mosque, a place used by the mosque leader to initiate the prayers.\n\nThe Al-Taqwa mosque placed in a Sunni Muslim district who make up the majority of the Taliban group.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Afghanistan's situation is difficult for religious scholars because supporting either the government or the Taliban lead to being targeted by the other.\n\n==Reactions==\nPresident Ashraf Ghani condemned the mosque attack as a terrorist act.\n\n==See also==\n*California mosque fire\n*Louisiana black church fires\n*2019 Tripoli shooting\n*July 2019 Kabul attack (disambiguation)\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n*  www.example.com","urls":["https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/05\/24\/world\/asia\/afghanistan-mosque-attack.html","https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2019\/05\/deadly-explosion-hits-mosque-afghanistan-kabul-190524093958397.html","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-afghanistan-blast\/bomb-in-afghan-mosque-kills-senior-cleric-during-friday-prayers-idUSKCN1SU0XN","https:\/\/www.usnews.com\/news\/world\/articles\/2019-05-24\/bomb-kills-at-least-one-during-friday-prayers-at-mosque-in-afghan-capital-ministry"]}

{"title":"1 July 2019 Kabul attack","article":"On 1 July 2019, a combined gun and bomb attack took place in the Wazir Akbar Khan neighborhood of Kabul, Afghanistan. The attackers initially detonated a bomb-laden truck, after which five gunmen entered a nearby building under construction and fired on Afghan security personnel evacuating people onto the street. At least forty-five were killed, including the five attackers. The spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Public Health, Wahidullah Mayar, said that 116 civilians, including 26 children and 5 women, were wounded. The Taliban claimed the responsibility for the bomb attack in Kabul and said although civilians were not the Taliban target, some were injured.\n\n== Background ==\nThe attack occurred during the ongoing Taliban\u2013United States peace talks in Doha, Qatar. In the days before the attack, the militant group carried out multiple deadly attacks on security forces all across the country.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the violence in Afghanistan has increased during the 18th year of the United States military presence in Afghanistan.\n\n== Attack ==\nThe Taliban attacked Afghanistan's capital housing military and government buildings using a powerful car bomb on 1 July 2019, and a gunfight began soon after. The attacks killed 40 civilians and injured 116. The bomb exploded during the morning in Kabul when the streets were filled with people.\n\nThe attack happened in two stages. The first was the detonation of a truck or minibus bomb, packed full of explosives, in central Kabul. The explosion happened in the Puli Mahmood Khan area of the Wazir Akbar Khan neighborhood during rush hour. The area houses many government, diplomatic and military buildings and installations. The blast was powerful, shaking buildings up to 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) away, sending a plume of smoke in the air and destroying many cars and buildings. At least 51 students were injured during the blast, which damaged two nearby schools and shattered windows of three others. The Pashto media organization Shamshad TV said their office was hit by the blast, with one security guard killed and several journalists wounded. The TV station aired images of broken glass and the damage to its office in the aftermath of the bombing. The New York Times reported that 40 people were killed in the car bombing, 34 civilians and 6 security forces. \n\nAfter the explosion, five attackers entered a nearby building under construction and opened fire on security personnel in the street, sparking a gunfight. The shootout lasted for over 7 hours until all 5 attackers were killed by responders. The spokesman for the Ministry of Interior Affairs, Nasrat Rahimi, said after the explosion, attackers entered the Ministry of Defense building, and two car bombs exploded separately near the museum site and the television site. The attackers had been surrounded by the ministry security forces and one of them was killed. He finally added that a child, a security guard of Shamshad TV and 2 soldiers of the Special Forces were killed during the attack incident and more than 210 people had been rescued during the operation. \n\nAn office belonging to the Afghan Football Federation was damaged during the incident, and its chief, Yosuf Kargar, and several players injured.\n\nThe Afghanistan Ministry of Education spokesman, Nooria Nazhat, announced that 51 students from two schools near the blast site were hurt by flying shards of glass, and the explosion resulted in part of the school collapsing.\n\n== Responsibility ==\nThe Taliban militant group has claimed responsibility for the attack, saying that it attacked \"the defence ministry\u2019s technical installation\".\n\nZabihullah Mujahid, one of two official spokesmen for the Taliban, mentioned on a Twitter account that a logistics and engineering unit of the Ministry of Defense was the intended target. He added, people were not the target of attacks, but some of them have been wounded.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nMany of the people wounded in the attack were taken into local hospitals, including many schoolchildren. Social media images reportedly showed some of the children in the hospital still holding books and wearing school uniforms. After the attack, many  residents and lawmakers criticized security and intelligence agencies, demanding to know how a truck full of explosives and five attackers managed to enter the area, which contains many secure buildings and compounds, among them the United States embassy and the Kabul Presidential Palace.\n\n=== Reactions ===\n==== Domestic ====\nThe Afghan government itself also condemned the attacks, with Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani saying that \"the Taliban, by conducting terrorist attacks, has demonstrated its vicious designs in killing Afghans and the continuation of the war in Afghanistan\".\n\n==== International ====\n*Shah Mahmood Qureshi reacted to a coordinated deadly attack by Taliban group in Kabul city, calling it an act of terrorism. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan in a statement said \u201cPakistan strongly condemns the terrorist attack in Kabul this morning that has reportedly resulted in several casualties. Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\u201d\n\n*Admiral Ali Shamkhani sent a message to Hamdullah Mohib, the National Security Adviser to Afghanistan\u2019s president, condemning Monday\u2019s deadly terrorist attack in Kabul.\n\n*Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a statement condemned the Taliban's attack in Kabul and reiterated the Qatari government's \"firm stance\" in rejecting \"violence and terrorism, regardless of their motives and reasons\".\n\n* The U.S. condemned a deadly car bombing Monday in Afghanistan's capital. The U.S. \"condemns in the strongest terms today\u2019s heinous terrorist attack, claimed by the Taliban, in which Afghan civilians and security personnel were killed and severely wounded,\" the White House said in a statement. \"This brazen attack demonstrates the Taliban\u2019s callous disregard for their fellow Afghans, who have repeatedly voiced the urgency of finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict,\", they added.\n\n* The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan tweeted \"UN is appalled by Taliban-claimed attack in  the civilian-populated area of #Kabul. Initial findings indicate scores of civilian casualties. UN is deeply saddened by credible reports of many injured children at nearby schools & demands end to indiscriminate blasts in civilian areas in [Afghanistan].\"\n\n==See also==\n*2019 Kabul mosque bombing\n*2019 Ghazni bombing\n*28 July 2019 Kabul suicide bombing\n\n== References ==","urls":["https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/07\/01\/world\/asia\/afghanistan-bombing-war-museum.html","https:\/\/uk.reuters.com\/article\/uk-afghanistan-attack\/gun-battle-ends-in-afghan-capital-after-taliban-blast-wounds-105-idUKKCN1TW1FB?rpc=401&","https:\/\/www.tolonews.com\/index.php\/afghanistan\/doha-talks-continue-amid-taliban","https:\/\/www.longwarjournal.org\/archives\/2019\/07\/taliban-launches-string-of-attacks-throughout-afghanistan.php","https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2019\/07\/explosion-hits-kabul-diplomatic-district-media-reports-190701043918371.html","https:\/\/www.thenational.ae\/world\/asia\/kabul-bomb-34-dead-after-taliban-attack-hits-military-compound-1.881227","https:\/\/www.rferl.org\/a\/powerful-blast-rocks-center-of-kabul\/30029551.html","https:\/\/ariananews.af\/51-students-injured-in-talibans-kabul-attack-moe\/","https:\/\/www.afp.com\/en\/news\/3954\/least-50-children-wounded-taliban-attack-kabul-doc-1i43nq5","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190701143602\/https:\/\/www.afp.com\/en\/news\/3954\/least-50-children-wounded-taliban-attack-kabul-doc-1i43nq5","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/av\/world-asia-48825403\/taliban-launch-gun-and-bomb-attack-in-kabul?intlink_from_url=&link_location=live-reporting-map","https:\/\/www.trtworld.com\/asia\/powerful-blast-in-afghan-capital-causes-dozens-of-casualties-27903","http:\/\/news.trust.org\/item\/20190701082412-m5515\/","https:\/\/uk.reuters.com\/article\/uk-afghanistan-attack-taliban\/taliban-militants-claim-responsibility-for-blast-in-afghan-capital-idUKKCN1TW1R1?rpc=401&","https:\/\/www.sbs.com.au\/news\/at-least-50-children-wounded-in-taliban-car-bomb-attack-on-kabul","https:\/\/www.tolonews.com\/afghanistan\/security-agencies-under-harsh-criticism-following-kabul-attack","http:\/\/www.xinhuanet.com\/english\/2019-07\/02\/c_138192750.htm","https:\/\/www.khaama.com\/pakistan-reacts-to-terrorist-attack-carried-out-by-taliban-in-kabul-city-03784\/","https:\/\/www.tasnimnews.com\/en\/news\/2019\/07\/02\/2044793\/iran-s-snsc-condemns-terror-attack-in-kabul","https:\/\/twitter.com\/TOLOnews\/status\/1145699246814969857","https:\/\/www.aa.com.tr\/en\/middle-east\/us-strongly-condemns-car-bombing-in-afghanistan\/1520755","https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/statement-press-secretary-regarding-attack-kabul\/"]}
