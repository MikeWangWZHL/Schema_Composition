{"title":"Civilian casualties from U.S. drone strikes","article":"Since the September 11 attacks, the United States government has carried out drone strikes in Pakistan (see drone strikes in Pakistan), Yemen (see drone strikes in Yemen), Somalia (see drone strikes in Somalia), Afghanistan, Iraq (see 2020 Baghdad International Airport airstrike), and Libya (see drone strikes in Libya).\n\nDrone strikes are part of a targeted killing campaign against jihadist militants; however, non-combatant civilians have also been killed in drone strikes. Determining precise counts of the total number killed, as well as the number of non-combatant civilians killed, is impossible; and tracking of strikes and estimates of casualties are compiled by a number of organizations, such as the Long War Journal (Pakistan and Yemen), the New America Foundation (Pakistan), and the London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism (Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan). The \"estimates of civilian casualties are hampered methodologically and practically\"; for example, \"estimates are largely compiled by interpreting news reports relying on anonymous officials or accounts from local media, whose credibility may vary.\"\n\n==Total numbers==\nMany scholars, such as Charles J. Dunlap, Geoffrey S. Corn, and Cynthia Marshell, have pointed out systematic weaknessess in counting civilian casualties from non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the media and press outlets- citing the inherent fact they lack (among many things), pre\/post strike HD FMV that the US Government has access to. Indeed, according to an Iraq\/Syria civilian casualties (CIVCAS) allegation tracker, declassified from CENTCOM - it can be seen how such information often discredits NGO reporting.\n\nA declassified, independent, internal review conducted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff - examines data from 2015 to 2017, on all airstrike and artillery data, affirmed delegation of Target Engagement Authority did not increase the rise of CIVCAS events and that Commanders throughout the chain of command exercised thorough oversight, Positive Identification, written guidance were sufficient and adequate in mitigation of civilian casualty risk, including in Areas Outside of Active Hostilities.\n\nLeaked documents from the Drone Papers, by The Intercept, have confirmed CT missions (including kinetic air strikes, including dones), during Operation Haymaker in Afghanistan, between 16 September 2011 to 16 September 2012 resulted in 14 CIVCAS events out of 2,082 total missions (0.67%).\n\nAccording to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, between January 20, 2009 and December 31, 2015 and 2016 reports, as well as many other government sources: \"Non-combatants are individuals who may not be made the object of attack under applicable international law. The term \u201cnon-combatant\u201d does not include an individual who is part of a belligerent party to an armed conflict, an individual who is taking a direct part in hostilities, or an individual who is targetable in the exercise of U.S. national self-defense. Males of military age may be non-combatants; it is not the case that all military-aged males in the vicinity of a target are deemed to be combatants.\" These reports also cover number of strikes, combatants and non-combatants killed. Between 2009 and 2015, out of 473 strikes between 64\u2013116 non-combatant deaths occurred. However during that period, the Obama Administration did count all military-age males in strike zones as combatants unless explicit intelligence exonerated them posthumously.\n\nThese numbers are independently confirmed by then-Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Dianne Feinstein, in a hearing on the 7th of Feb 2013, \"But for the past several years, this committee has done significant oversight of the government's conduct of targeted strikes and the figures we have obtained from the executive branch, which we have done our utmost to verify, confirm that the number of civilian casualties that have resulted from such strikes has typically been in the single digits.\" Leaked CIA documents provided to the Washington Post, further confirm the number of CIVCAS events, \"One table estimates that as many as 152 combatants were killed and 26 were injured during the first six months of 2011. Lengthy columns with spaces to record civilian deaths or injuries contain nothing but zeroes.\"\n\nAccording to the Long War Journal, which follows US anti-terror developments, as of mid-2011, drone strikes in Pakistan since 2006 had killed 2,018 militants and 138 civilians. The New America Foundation stated in mid-2011 that from 2004 to 2011, 80% of the 2,551 people killed in the strikes were militants. The Foundation stated that 95% of those killed in 2010 were militants and that, as of 2012, 15% of the total people killed by drone strikes were either known civilians or unknown. The Foundation also states that in 2012 the rate of known civilian and unknown casualties was 2 percent, whereas the Bureau of Investigative Journalism say the rate of civilian casualties for 2012 is 9 percent. The Bureau, based on extensive research in mid-2011, claims that at least 385 civilians were among the dead, including more than 160 children.\n\nIt has been reported that 160 children have died from UAV-launched attacks in Pakistan and that over 1,000 civilians have been injured. Moreover, additional reporting has found that known militant leaders have constituted only 2 percent of all drone-related fatalities. These sources run counter to the Obama administration's claim that \"nearly for the past year there hasn't been a single collateral death\" due to UAV-based attacks.\n\nThe New America Foundation estimates that for the period 2004-2011, the non-militant fatality rate was approximately 20%.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, on March 6, 2019, signed an executive order revoking the requirement that U.S. intelligence officials publicly report the number of civilians killed in Counter-Terrorism missions in Areas Outside of Active Hostilities. It's worth noting, however, civilian casualties by global US operations are still reported and made public, pursaunt to Section 1057 of the National Defense Authorisation Act of 2018. The Trump administration had previously ignored a May 2018 deadline for an annual accounting of civilian and enemy casualties required under Executive Order 13732 signed in 2016 by Barack Obama.\n\n== Afghanistan==\nAfter more than 30 UAV-based strikes hit civilian homes in Afghanistan in 2012, President Hamid Karzai demanded that such attacks end, but the practice continues in areas of Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter has criticized such use of UAVs: \"We don't know how many hundreds of innocent civilians have been killed in these attacks\u00a0... This would have been unthinkable in previous times.\"\n\n== Pakistan==\n\nIn October 2013, the Pakistani government revealed that since 2008, civilian casualties made up 3 percent of deaths from drone strikes. Since 2008, it alleges there have been 317 drone strikes that killed 2,160 Islamic militants and 67 civilians. This is less than previous government and independent organization calculations of collateral damage from these attacks. S. Azmat Hassan, a former ambassador of Pakistan, said in July 2009 that American UAV attacks were turning Pakistani opinion against the United States and that 35 or 40 such attacks killed 8 or 9 top al-Qaeda operatives.\n\n== Yemen==\n\nAn attack by the US in December 2013, in a wedding procession in Yemen, killed 12 men and wounded at least 15 other people, including the bride. US and Yemeni officials said the dead were members of the armed group Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), but witnesses and relatives told Human Rights Watch the casualties were civilians. Witnesses and relatives told Human Rights Watch that no members of AQAP were in the procession and provided names and other information about those killed and wounded. They said the dead included the groom's adult son and the bride received superficial face wounds. The local governor and military commander called the casualties a \u201cmistake\u201d and gave money and assault rifles to the families of those killed and wounded \u2013 a traditional gesture of apology in Yemen. A few days after the incident, Yemeni MPs voted for a ban against the use of drones in Yemen, though it is unclear what effect this will have on drone usage.\n\n==Criticism==\n\nThere are a number of vocal critics of the use of UAVs to track and kill terrorists and militants. A major criticism of drone strikes is that they result in excessive collateral damage. David Kilcullen and Andrew Exum wrote in the New York Times that drone strikes \"have killed about 14 terrorist leaders\". It has also killed an unknown number of militants. But, according to Pakistani sources, they have also killed some 700 civilians. Gr\u00e9goire Chamayou's analysis, of one three hour long surveillance and attack operation on a convoy of three SUVs that killed civilians in Afghanistan in February 2010, shows a typical, if notorious, case.  Throughout the operation there is a sense of the drone controllers\u2019 desperation to destroy the people and destroy the vehicles \u2014 whatever the evidence of their clearly civilian nature. The transcript is full of statements like \u201cthat truck would make a beautiful target\u201d; \u201cOh, sweet target!\u201d; \u201cthe men appear to be moving tactically\u201d; and \u201cThey\u2019re going to do something nefarious\u201d.\n\nIt is difficult to reconcile these figures because the drone strikes are often in areas that are inaccessible to independent observers and the data includes reports by local officials and local media, neither of whom are reliable sources. Critics also fear that by making killing seem clean and safe, so-called surgical UAV strikes will allow the United States to remain in a perpetual state of war. However, others maintain that drones \"allow for a much closer review and much more selective targeting process than do other instruments of warfare\" and are subject to Congressional oversight. Like any military technology, armed UAVs will kill people, combatants and innocents alike. Noted sociologist Amitai Etzioni, writing in a 2013 Military Review article concluded \"the main turning point concerns the question of whether we should go to war at all.\"\n\n==See also==\n\n*Casualty recording\n*Global policeman\n* International law\n* List of attacks on civilians attributed to United States government forces\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.propublica.org\/article\/everything-we-know-so-far-about-drone-strikes","https:\/\/www.thebureauinvestigates.com\/stories\/2017-01-17\/obamas-covert-drone-war-in-numbers-ten-times-more-strikes-than-bush","https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/world\/airstrike-kills-top-iran-general-qassim-suleimani-baghdad-airport-iraqi-n1109821","http:\/\/www.law.columbia.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/microsites\/human-rights-institute\/files\/COLUMBIACountingDronesFinal.pdf","https:\/\/www.justsecurity.org\/43148\/letter-editor-civilian-casualty-investigation-eyewitness-accounts\/","https:\/\/www.loc.gov\/rr\/frd\/Military_Law\/Military_Law_Review\/pdf-files\/225-issue2-2017.pdf","https:\/\/www.lawfareblog.com\/flawed-human-rights-watch-report-gaza","https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/3390550-Iraq-Syria-CIVCAS-Allegation-Tracker.html","https:\/\/www.jcs.mil\/Portals\/36\/Documents\/Civilian%20Casualty%20Review%20Report%20Redacted.pdf","https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/2460857-operation-haymaker-afghanistan-documents.html","https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/2938429-Read-the-summary-on-airstrikes-and-the-number-of.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/05\/29\/world\/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html","https:\/\/www.intelligence.senate.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/hearings\/11331.pdf","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/national-security\/top-pakistani-leaders-secretly-backed-cia-drone-campaign-secret-documents-show\/2013\/10\/23\/15e6b0d8-3beb-11e3-b6a9-da62c264f40e_story.html","http:\/\/www.longwarjournal.org\/pakistan-strikes","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150218080812\/http:\/\/www.longwarjournal.org\/pakistan-strikes.php","http:\/\/www.economist.com\/node\/21524916","http:\/\/afpak.foreignpolicy.com\/posts\/2012\/11\/02\/counting_civilian_casualties_in_cia_s_drone_war","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20121104052227\/http:\/\/afpak.foreignpolicy.com\/posts\/2012\/11\/02\/counting_civilian_casualties_in_cia_s_drone_war","http:\/\/www.thebureauinvestigates.com\/2011\/08\/10\/most-complete-picture-yet-of-cia-drone-strikes\/","http:\/\/www.thebureauinvestigates.com\/2011\/08\/11\/more-than-160-children-killed-in-us-strikes\/","http:\/\/www.thebureauinvestigates.com\/2011\/08\/10\/one-thousand-drone-injuries-are-they-truly-lucky-o\/","http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2012\/09\/05\/opinion\/bergen-obama-drone\/index.html","http:\/\/english.aljazeera.net\/indepth\/opinion\/2011\/07\/201172612395401691.html","http:\/\/counterterrorism.newamerica.net\/drones","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110830213657\/http:\/\/counterterrorism.newamerica.net\/drones","https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/5985986-ANNUAL-REPORT-CIVILIAN-CASUALTIES-in-CONNECTION.html","https:\/\/obamawhitehouse.archives.gov\/the-press-office\/2016\/07\/01\/executive-order-united-states-policy-pre-and-post-strike-measures","https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/presidential-actions\/executive-order-revocation-reporting-requirement\/","https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2019-03-06\/trump-cancels-u-s-report-on-civilian-deaths-in-drone-strikes","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/06\/25\/opinion\/americas-shameful-human-rights-record.html?_r=1","https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/world\/2013\/10\/31\/pakistan-done-deaths\/3322539\/","http:\/\/www.newsweek.com\/id\/205725","https:\/\/www.hrw.org\/news\/2014\/02\/19\/us-yemen-drone-strike-may-violate-obama-policy","http:\/\/thelede.blogs.nytimes.com\/2013\/12\/19\/the-aftermath-of-drone-strikes-on-a-wedding-convoy-in-yemen\/","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/05\/17\/opinion\/17exum.html?pagewanted=all","http:\/\/longreads.tni.org\/war-pacification\/drone-robot-imperium\/","http:\/\/icps.gwu.edu\/files\/2013\/03\/Etzioni_DroneDebate.pdfi","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20130522061025\/http:\/\/icps.gwu.edu\/files\/2013\/03\/Etzioni_DroneDebate.pdf"]}
{"title":"2015 Tokyo Drone Incident","article":"In the , a Phantom 2 drone carrying traces of radiation was found on the roof of the Japanese Prime Minister's Official Residence.  It had been controlled by Yasuo Yamamoto, an anti-nuclear protester from Fukui Prefecture. Yamamoto flew the drone there carrying sand containing cesium from Fukushima prefecture on April 9, but the drone was not discovered until April 22.\n\nThis caused substantial embarrassment to the authorities, both for the security breach and for the delayed discovery of the drone. Yamamoto was later given a two-year suspended sentence, and the incident led to wide-reaching changes to regulations on drones in Japan. This along with other incidents led to authorities in Japan becoming much more aware of issues related to drones.\n\n==Yasuo Yamamoto==\nYasuo Yamamoto was an unemployed 40-year-old man from Fukui prefecture and former Japan Air Self-Defense Force enlistee, residing in Obama, Fukui. Fukui prefecture is home to 13 of Japan's 48 operational nuclear reactors, and in 2014 the reactivation of Japan's nuclear reactors, idled after the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami and subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster was a serious topic of debate.\n\nIn July 2014 Yamamoto started a blog, which he called \"Santa Kantei\" (Santa at the Prime Minister's office). He referred to himself in one blog post as \"a lone wolf\" and in another post said \u201cI will not hesitate to commit a terror act to stop restart (of nuclear reactors)\u201d. In October 2014 he used a drone to observe the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant in Kagoshima prefecture, which was then due to be restarted.\n\nIn October 2014 he went to Fukushima to gather contaminated sand. Yamamoto considered various methods to draw attention to his cause, and considered landing a drone with the Fukushima sand at a US diplomatic housing facility. On December 24, when Japanese Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe's new cabinet was launched, he had intended to do his flight to the PM's office from a nearby park, but did not do so as it was too stressful. In March 2015 he again visited Fukushima prefecture to gather contaminated sand.\n\n==Drone flight==\nOn April 7, 2015 Yamamoto left his home and travelled to Tokyo with his DJI Phantom 2 drone. The drones are sold only in white, but Yamamoto had painted his black, had painted over LEDs on it in black, and placed a radiation symbol sticker on it. On the following day he wished to fly his drone but the weather was poor, so he delayed it until the next day. On April 9 at 3:30am he flew the drone from a parking lot located near the Prime Minister's office. He had planned to land it in front of the Prime Minister's office, but he lost control of it and it landed on the roof of the Prime Minister's office, which functions as a helipad.\n\nAfter losing control of the drone Yamamoto returned to Fukui and posted on his blog about how there were no reports about his drone. On April 18 he showed a picture of himself preparing a second drone.\n\n===Discovery===\nThe drone was found by accident on April 22 by an official who was taking new employees on a tour of the building.\n\n==Arrest and trial==\nAfter the drone was eventually found, Yamamoto turned himself in to the police on April 24 at the Obama police station and was arrested.  The following day he was transported to Tokyo.\n\nOn February 16, 2016 the Tokyo District Court handed down a two-year sentence, suspended for four years and ordered the drone confiscated. Prosecutors had asked for a three-year jail sentence.\n\n==Aftereffects==\n\n===Changes to law===\nBefore the incident drones were only prohibited near airports or in the flightpath of planes.  The National Diet passed a law restricting drone flights near special sites such as the Prime Minister's office, Imperial Palace, Supreme Court and nuclear reactors. Violators would face a prison sentence of a year or a \u00a5500,000 fine. Paragliders would also be covered by the law.\n\nIn December 2015 changes to the Civil Aeronautics Law were passed through Japan's National Diet banned flights by drones weighing over 200 grams in crowded urban areas, altitudes of 150 meters or more, and near airports. Among other places, this meant that drones were banned in all of 23 central wards of Tokyo, although the Ministry of Transport can grant case by case exceptions.\n\n===Police countermeasures===\nAfter the incident Tokyo police investigated various options for counter-drone measures, and Japan's National Police Agency requested \u00a5400 million yen for anti-drone countermeasures. It planned to procure radar, cameras, and nets designed to capture drones.\n\nThe police planned to launch a drone interceptor squad, and by January 2016 the Tokyo police riot squad had acquired an interceptor drone to capture suspicious drones, and it was announced that they planned to acquire another 10 by February 2016. The 2016 Tokyo Marathon was the first event at which the police planned to use drones as part of the event's security, with several interceptor drones deployed.\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2015\/apr\/22\/drone-with-radiation-sign-lands-on-roof-of-japanese-prime-ministers-office","https:\/\/www.usnews.com\/news\/world\/articles\/2015\/04\/25\/police-arrest-man-over-drone-landing-at-japan-pm-office","https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/tech-policy\/2015\/04\/25\/man-arrested-for-flying-drone-carrying-radioactive-sand-in-tokyo\/","http:\/\/www.japantimes.co.jp\/news\/2016\/02\/16\/national\/crime-legal\/man-landed-drone-roof-japanese-prime-ministers-office-gets-suspended-sentence\/","https:\/\/www.japantimes.co.jp\/news\/2015\/05\/16\/national\/media-national\/kantei-santa-makes-heard-din-election-vans\/","http:\/\/www.japantimes.co.jp\/news\/2014\/12\/12\/national\/politics-diplomacy\/in-fukui-economy-reactors-inseparable-in-election-debate\/","http:\/\/ajw.asahi.com\/article\/behind_news\/social_affairs\/AJ201504250021","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150427224620\/http:\/\/ajw.asahi.com\/article\/behind_news\/social_affairs\/AJ201504250021","http:\/\/www.japantimes.co.jp\/news\/2015\/04\/27\/national\/drone-flyer-surveilled-american-embassy-housing-facility-buzzed-sendai-nuclear-plant\/","http:\/\/www.japantimes.co.jp\/news\/2015\/04\/25\/national\/fukui-man-arrested-landing-drone-prime-ministers-office-says-protesting-nuclear-power-policy\/","http:\/\/www.miamiherald.com\/news\/nation-world\/world\/article19207314.html","http:\/\/www.ibtimes.com\/japan-arrests-yasuo-yamamoto-landing-radioactive-sand-laced-drone-shinzo-abes-office-1896688","http:\/\/www.japantimes.co.jp\/news\/2015\/07\/09\/national\/japan-lower-house-passes-bill-restricting-drone-flights\/","http:\/\/www.japantimes.co.jp\/news\/2015\/12\/09\/national\/japan-ground-hobbyist-drones-urban-areas-impose-sweeping-restrictions-elsewhere\/","http:\/\/www.japantimes.co.jp\/news\/2015\/04\/30\/national\/crime-legal\/tokyo-police-studying-technology-detect-capture-drones\/","http:\/\/www.japantimes.co.jp\/news\/2015\/08\/28\/national\/npa-seeks-funds-jam-capture-drones\/","https:\/\/asiancorrespondent.com\/2015\/12\/tokyo-police-launch-interceptor-drone-squad\/","http:\/\/www.japantimes.co.jp\/news\/2016\/01\/18\/national\/metropolitan-police-conduct-drone-capturing-drill-ahead-tokyo-marathon\/","http:\/\/www.japantimes.co.jp\/news\/2016\/02\/13\/national\/crime-legal\/police-deploy-drones-tokyo-marathon\/","http:\/\/www.japantimes.co.jp\/news\/2016\/02\/28\/national\/social-issues\/high-tech-security-deployed-tokyo-marathon\/"]}
{"title":"Drone strike","article":"A drone strike is an attack by one or more unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAV) or weaponized commercial unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). \n\nFor unmanned combat aerial vehicles, an attack usually involves firing a missile or releasing a bomb at a target. The drone may be equipped with such weapons as guided bombs, cluster bombs, incendiary devices, air-to-surface missiles, air-to-air missiles, anti-tank guided missiles or other types of precision-guided munitions, autocannons and machine guns. Since the turn of the century, most drone strikes have been carried out by the US military in such countries as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria, Iraq, Somalia, and Yemen using air-to-surface missiles.\n\nDrones strikes are used for targeted killings by several countries.\n\nOnly the United States, Israel, China, Iran, Italy, India, Pakistan, Russia, Turkey, and Poland are known to have manufactured operational UCAV as of 2019.\n\nDrone attacks can be done by weaponized commercial unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), such as being loaded with dangerous payloads, and crashed into vulnerable targets or detonated above them. They can also drop hand grenades or other munitions. Payloads could include explosives, shrapnel, chemical, radiological or biological hazards. Multiple drones may attack simultaneously in a so-called \"drone swarm attack\". Anti-UAV systems are being developed by states to counter the threat of drone strikes. This is, however, proving difficult. According to James Rogers, an academic who studies drone warfare, \"There is a big debate out there at the moment about what the best way is to counter these small UAVs, whether they are used by hobbyists causing a bit of a nuisance or in a more sinister manner by a terrorist actor.\"\n\n==Drone strikes by the United States==\n\n\n\nIn 1991, both AAI RQ-2 Pioneer and AeroVironment FQM-151 Pointer drones were used for surveillance during the Gulf War. In 1993, General Atomics GNAT UAVs were tested for surveillance in the Yugoslav Wars. In 2001\u20132002, General Atomics MQ-1 Predator drones were equipped with missiles to strike enemy targets.\n\nHowever, Ben Emmerson, special investigator for the United Nations Human Rights Council, said that U.S. drone strikes may have violated international humanitarian law. The Intercept reported, \"Between January 2012 and February 2013, U.S. special operations airstrikes [in northeastern Afghanistan] killed more than 200 people. Of those, only 35 were the intended targets. During one five-month period of the operation, according to the documents, nearly 90 percent of the people killed in airstrikes were not the intended targets.\" In the United States drone strikes are used to lessen the number of casualties since there is no one that has to physically fight in combat. Being able to send drones to fight reduces the number of American lives lost substantially. The U.S had increased the use of drone strikes significantly during Obama's presidency compared to Bush's.With the help from joint defense facility at Pine Gap, which locates targets by intercepting radio signals, the U.S. is double-tap drone striking.\n\nIn August 2018, Al Jazeera reported that a Saudi Arabian-led coalition \"battling Houthi rebels [in Yemen] secured secret deals with al-Qaeda in Yemen and recruited hundreds of the group's fighters.... Key figures in the deal-making said the United States was aware of the arrangements and held off on drone attacks against the armed group, which was created by Osama bin Laden in 1988.\"\n\n==Drone strikes by the Islamic State==\n\nSmall drones and quadcopters have been used for strikes by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. A group of twelve or more have been piloted by specially trained pilots to drop munitions onto enemy forces.

{"title":"2018 Caracas drone attack","article":"On 4 August 2018, two drones detonated explosives near Avenida Bol\u00edvar, Caracas, where Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the President of Venezuela, was addressing the Bolivarian National Guard in front of the Centro Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Towers and Palacio de Justicia de Caracas. The Venezuelan government claims the event was a targeted attempt to assassinate Maduro, though the cause and intention of the explosions is debated. Others have suggested the incident was a false flag operation designed by the government to justify repression of opposition in Venezuela.\n\n==Incident==\nTwo small drones carrying explosives were detonated while President Maduro delivered an outdoor speech, possibly in attempt to attack the president and other government officials. The incident occurred in the middle of a speech he was giving commemorating the Bolivarian National Guard's 81st anniversary. The first drone hovered over Avenida Bolivar, detonating in the air over National Guardsmen standing in ranks. It was reported that seven National Guard officers involved in the parade were injured and treated in hospital, other sources later claim it was eight.* * *  After the explosion, bodyguards immediately protected Maduro with ballistic shields. Maduro, his wife Cilia Flores, and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, who were standing next to him, left the scene unharmed. A second explosion was then heard seconds later \u2013 hundreds of National Guardsmen fled the area, abandoning President Maduro, and the broadcast of the event was cut. Despite the images of National Guardsmen fleeing the scene that were broadcast to the public, Minister of Communication Jorge Rodr\u00edguez falsely stated that the troops maintained their ranks in the parade.\n\nA second drone crashed into the Don Eduardo apartment block, located two blocks from where Maduro was speaking. Local journalists and residents shared images of smoke appearing from the apartment building's windows shortly after the incident. A woman living in the building said that a drone had crashed into one of the building's windows, injuring a girl who was taken to hospital.\n\nVideo footage shows two drones; amateur video of one drone exploding, a video showing few people in the area, and another video recorded by Telemundo cameraman Cesar Saavedra of a drone hitting the Don Eduardo apartment building.\n\nMany members of the press were arrested immediately after the incident, preventing independent investigations and reporting. Reporters from VIVOplay and TVVenezuela were detained by National Guardsmen shortly after the incident.\n\n==Investigation==\n\n=== Government ===\n\n==== Initial ====\n\nIn a televised address to the nation two hours after the incident, Maduro stated that an investigation had been opened immediately and a number of those connected to the attack had been apprehended and charged. Eleven journalists were detained during the attack and released afterwards. Six other suspects were initially arrested within hours of the incident, which later increased to seven. Reportedly, one of these was known to authorities because of his involvement in the 2014 protests, whilst another had an arrest warrant out for apparently taking part in the assault on Fort Paramacay.\n\nPresident Maduro also laid blame on extreme right-wing elements in his own country acting together with extreme right-wing elements in neighbouring Colombia, and specifically named Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos as being behind the incident. A spokesperson for President Santos promptly denied the accusations. Maduro also suggested that Venezuelan exiles in the United States, particularly Miami, Florida, may have been involved.\n\nAccording to Interior Minister N\u00e9stor Reverol only two DJI M600 drones were used, though Minister of Communication Jorge Rodr\u00edguez said that there were three drones used during the incident, and the reason they failed to reach their target was that radio inhibitors made them lose signal. Police at the scene had previously said that authorities shot down a drone. Following a brief initial two-day investigation, Reverol presented its findings and explained that the two drones he claimed were involved were loaded with over 4lb combined of plastic explosive C4 elements, and that one was to be exploded above Maduro's head with the other intended to explode directly in front of the President. In one presentation, Maduro showed debris that he \"insisted\" revealed the drone by the stage was carrying gunpowder and lead, and only the one that hit the building was loaded with C4 as well as gunpowder.\n\nOn 6 August 2018, Prosecutor General of Venezuela, Tarek William Saab, announced that two individuals described to be the alleged pilots were arrested and \"will be charged with the crimes of treason and intentional homicide\" in addition to other crimes.\n\n====Post-arrests====\n\nShortly after midnight VST on the morning of Tuesday, 7 August, Maduro said that he had \"hard evidence\" of \"the Colombian oligarchy\" planning the assassination, and that he would share it \"in the next few hours\". Maduro announced in a video at the same time that they now knew that the perpetrators were trained during April and June 2018 in Chin\u00e1cota in Norte de Santander, Colombia, an area which borders the north of Venezuela. In this video he also said that he had been informed that Juan Manuel Santos had told former Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy that Maduro would be gone before he left office. The promised report had not surfaced by the afternoon.\n\nIn the evening, Maduro gave a two-hour television presentation from Miraflores Palace which included a partially-censored video of former Venezuelan security official Juan Carlos Monasterios Vanegas, who said he was one of the \"bombers\", giving a statement blaming Julio Borges and Juan Requesens. President Maduro directly accused opposition leaders Borges and Requesens of being behind the incident, also saying that Borges lived in a mansion in Bogot\u00e1 that the outgoing Colombian government paid for, though no details of his \"alleged role\" were revealed. During this time, agents belonging to the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN), Venezuela's intelligence agency, arrested Requesens and his sister, student leader Rafaela Requesens, though the latter was later released. In the video, Monasterios claimed Requesens told him \"to kill the President\".\n\nAs members of the Venezuelan National Assembly, Borges and Requesens received parliamentary immunity. The arrest of Requesens was described as a violation of the Constitution of Venezuela, specifically Article 200 which states that \"only the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, subject to authorization in advance from the National Assembly, shall have the power to order their arrest and prosecution\". However, Diosdado Cabello, president of the disparate Constituent National Assembly, said he would \"introduce legislation\" to strip them of the protections. The protected status of the pair was then removed by the next day.\n\nIn response to the accusations, Borges tweeted a statement from Bogot\u00e1 telling Maduro that he was \"not fooling anybody\", calling the supposed attack a \"farce\" that Maduro \"staged to justify the persecution of opponents\". Cabello responded to this, telling him to \"go find some good lawyers\".Maduro's evening presentation claimed that everyone involved in the attack was offered $50\u00a0million USD as well as United States citizenship status. He also said that they had planned an attack on 5 July, which was postponed due to the drones not arriving on time. Two of those who were arrested and named by Maduro as being involved and providing evidence were a Colombian, Rayder Russo, who was accused of being a planner and financier of the alleged attack, and an American, Osman Delgado, who was accused of being another financier. Both Russo and Delgado were known by the Venezuelan resistance to be informants loyal to Maduro, with rebel leader \u00d3scar P\u00e9rez previously revealing that the two were \"moles\" selling information to the Bolivarian government in December 2017.\n\nOn Wednesday, 8 August, Saab said that investigators had so far connected nineteen people to the attack, and three had already been charged. Maduro also named wanted individuals living in Colombia and the US state of Florida, saying he wanted cooperation from these two nations and that he \"[trusts] in the good faith of Donald Trump\". On Thursday, 9 August, Reverol said that 25 people were under investigation, and Efecto Cocuyo reported that eight had been detained. Though Borges and Requesens are leaders of the Justice First party, Reverol revealed that \"the majority of the suspects are from the resistance group Come Venezuela\" (sic).\n\nMinister of Communication Jorge Rodr\u00edguez gave a national presentation on 10 August announcing that at least one of the drones involved was detonated from the United States, though a report by The Independent that was warning of drone threats said this could be done \"from 5 kilometres\" away only, as well as showing a supposed flight map of the drones path from Colombia all the way to Avenida Bol\u00edvar. Rodr\u00edguez also said that he had submitted a Red Notice to Interpol for the capture of \"assassin\" Julio Borges, and showed a video of Juan Requesens recorded in Helicoide.\n\n==== Raids and seizures ====\nOne announcement of alleged perpetrators by Reverol on Thursday, 9 August, included details of several properties that the investigation had seized. They were owned by Delgado, who was accused of helping to finance the attack. Two cars and an apartment in his name were also seized and raided.\n\nThe SEBIN searched the Pestana Hotel, which is almost eight kilometers from the place of the incident, during the investigations of the events. Caracas Chronicles reported that the homes of Juan Requesens, Julio Borges and other deputies, Julio Mora and Jorge Mora, had been raided.\n\nRafaela Requesens, Juan's sister and student President of the Central University of Venezuela, expressed her anger that at least forty SEBIN agents broke into their house, also saying that the government wanted to plant false evidence to incriminate her brother. On 7 August, the SEBIN also raided the house of students Valeria Sosa and Luis Alfredo Sosa, from Andr\u00e9s Bello Catholic University and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University, respectively, and whose mother is accused of being involved in the drone attack. Roberto Rodr\u00edguez, a student leader at Andr\u00e9s Bello, denounced that the raid was done without a search warrant, that the electricity was cut off from the building, that many belongings in the house were stolen, and that the family were forced to escape.\n\n==== Requesens videos ====\n\n\nDuring his August 10 presentation, Rodr\u00edguez showed a video of Requesens allegedly admitting to working with people involved in the supposed attack. In the video, Requesens named several of the suspects, including Borges, though this was limited to him saying that Borges \u201casked [him] for a favour to help a person get from Venezuela to Colombia\u201d. He added that this person was Monasterios and that they had written to Mauricio Jim\u00e9nez, an immigration official in Colombia, for help with getting passage, who immediately offered it. Requesens gave no details relating to an attack on Maduro. The opposition condemned Rodr\u00edguez's actions, saying that Requesens was drugged and tortured into making a false confession. One source from Requesens\u2019 Justice First party assured journalists that the government drugged Requesens to obtain confessions and, when they realised he was still of sound mind, then continued to drug him until he became incontinent, as well as threatening to murder his parents and rape his sister. In a second video, Requesens is wearing only underwear which is visibly stained with faeces. Following the release of the videos, Requesens was moved from being held at the prison of SEBIN, El Helicoide, to the Palacio de Justicia. After five hours, he was returned to Helicoide with his hearing deferred and being denied to see his lawyer.\n\nHealth professionals discussed the behavior of Requesens in the videos broadcast to the public. National Assembly deputy and doctor Jos\u00e9 Manuel Olivares stated that \"[t]he clinical signs of Juan Requesens show that there is an alteration of cognitive conditions, which is clinically associated with the administration of drugs that affect the conscience or the will\". An independent Venezuelan psychologist, Alberto Barradas, also observed his behavior, stating in a \"subjective conclusion\" that Requesens appears \"drugged, beaten, threatened\", later saying \"[a]s a Venezuelan, I think we are outraged to see the images of a deputy full of faeces, of excrement, knowing he was tortured. I believe that as Venezuelans we must feel anger, pain and indignation\". In a moment of protest and solidarity with Requesens, Venezuelans demonstrated in public while wearing underwear to share moral support for Requesens, who was seen in the government's video wearing underwear covered in faeces.\n\nThough he was originally transferred to the court building on 10 August, Requesens\u2019 hearing was deferred to Monday, August 13. This hearing went ahead, lasting two days, and on Tuesday, August 14 he was denied bail. He was remanded in custody after being charged with seven crimes against Maduro and the State, to go on trial and face Venezuela's maximum punishment of 30 years in prison.\n\nOn August 12, the government shared a third video of Requesens. In it was Requesens again speaking to camera, in what they claimed was another part of the \"confession\" from the first video. Requesens says that he briefly had telephone contact with a man who identified himself as \"Alexander\", who confirmed that Monasterios had got to Colombia.\n\nHowever, at his hearing, Requesens told his lawyer, Joel Garc\u00eda, that he doesn\u2019t remember recording a confession video or any of the people he named. Requesens also told Garc\u00eda that guards gave him the stained underwear to \"mock him\". None of the videos were submitted as evidence.\n\n==== Further arrests ====\nOn 10 August, SEBIN arrested Luis Enrique Mart\u00ednez Rico, the Coordinator of Security and Defense Commission of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), the government's political party. Reports stated that Mart\u00ednez was arrested due to his alleged involvement in the incident. Colonel Garcia Palomo said in a 13 August statement delivered to La Patilla that \"I have no connection with the events that took place in Caracas on 4 August, through the use of drones or the people who they abused, whom I do not know\" (sic).\n\nOn August 14, the number of suspects had increased to 34, fourteen of whom had been charged, with Saab saying it could rise further. It was also announced that Venezuela were now formally seeking extradition of suspects from Peru, with the government having issued 27 international arrest warrants to Interpol, as well as requesting account blocks and asset freezing for Osman Delgado and Julio Borges. On August 22, the numbers of those implicated by the government rose again, Saab saying that 25 people had been charged with 43 total suspects involved. The previous Sunday he had named several of these extra suspects, and announced that there were now only 18 Interpol alerts out, with nine extradition orders between Colombia, the US, and Peru.\n\nCabello accused another deputy of the National Assembly, Ismael Garc\u00eda, of being involved in the \"conspiracy\" on August 15. Garc\u00eda was a member of Primero Justicia with Borges and Requesens until he ran for candidacy with Acci\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica on August 10. Garc\u00eda had been reportedly \"in the sights\" of the regime in the days before this, along with Jos\u00e9 Manuel Olivares, who had recently been forced into exile.\n\nMaduro said during one speech that he knew that the attackers \"were planning a transitional government\" and that current politicians were intended to lead it.\n\n=== Independent ===\nOne early independent investigation by NGO Control Ciudadano alternatively claimed that \"at least one drone belonged to the military\", and that a drone was \"shot\", blaming the government but indicating that it would be unintentional.\n\nSome investigative journalism reports began appearing. Citizen journalism organization Bellingcat stated that two drones \"likely\" armed with explosives were involved and that \"[d]espite apparent claims from one group, it is not possible to accurately attribute this apparent attack without further information\".\n\nAn informal report by a South American political commentator that followed similar analysis to Bellingcat also came to an uncertain conclusion, but rated the Maduro government staging the incident as a \"1\/3\" chance and more likely than a \"1\/10\" assassination attempt, saying that \"[f]ar too much doesn't add up\", like Maduro \"knowing who the culprits [were] immediately\" and some of the claims being \"clearly made up\", comparing these to evidence North Korea gave for imprisoning Otto Warmbier.\n\nThough various bodies and countries asked for an independent investigation to be performed in Venezuela, the practice of censorship in the nation prevented this from happening. One of the leading independent investigatory organisations in Venezuela, Armando.Info, was completely blocked in August 2018, with four of its writers also having travel restrictions imposed, barring them from leaving.\n\nOn 14 March 2019, CNN revealed new details about the plot, based on new videos.\n\n==Responsibility claims==\nResponsibility for the attacks \"has been claimed by a confusing array of spokesmen\", including groups named \"The Resistance\", \"T-shirt Soldiers\" and the \"Phoenix Group\".\n\nA group named Soldados de Franelas (\"T-shirt Soldiers\") claimed responsibility for the attack on Twitter. Another group, called Operaci\u00f3n F\u00e9nix (\"Operation Phoenix\"), made vague claims on Twitter, accusing the Maduro government of being involved in drug trafficking and stating that they sought to restore democracy in Venezuela. Three hours after the attack, Venezuelan journalist Patricia Poleo read a press release on her own YouTube channel from Miami, saying that militants from the F\u00e9nix group claimed the attack. Different sources have variously claimed both groups as having connections to the Venezuelan rebel leader \u00d3scar P\u00e9rez, who had been killed by Venezuelan government armed forces in the El Junquito raid.\n\nSalvatore Lucchese, a former Chief of Police of San Diego Municipality, Carabobo and former member of the Popular Will opposition party, claimed in an interview with Reuters in Bogot\u00e1 that he largely organized the events, adding that the \"armed struggle\" would continue and \"no dictator leaves power peacefully\". On the evening of 7 August, Maduro acknowledged this claim, telling the people in his two-hour national broadcast that \"[a] former police boss of the Venezuelan right has been claiming responsibility for leading the attack. Today he was a special guest at the swearing-in of Colombia's incoming president\". The day after, Lucchese tweeted that he \"didn\u2019t do anything\" and was \"one more soldier fighting for freedom\".\n\nOn his Spanish-language talk show, Bayly, Peruvian-American journalist Jaime Bayly claimed that he had known about the attack during the week before and he supported it. He warned that there would be more attacks coming up.\n\nA man who said he was a military dissident said that he had been part of a group of similar dissenters from all branches of the Venezuelan armed forces plotting a coup in Bogot\u00e1 to overthrow the Maduro government, but had no plans of assassination and were not involved in the attack on August 4, having been infiltrated and disseminated some weeks before. Instead, he says that in April a group of civilians approached his group wanting to join forces and kill Maduro, and he believes they will have performed the attack because of videos they showed of armed drones in Miami. Bloomberg gives credence to this account because of the lack of organisation that the attack appeared to have.\n\n==Suspects and arrests==\n\n\n\nMaduro and Reverol, acting as the Ministry of Interior, Justice and Peace, released the names of wanted people that informants named as committing the attack. The full names and photos of these people were released on wanted posters in Venezuela. El Nacional reported fifteen names on the afternoon of Thursday, 9 August. Diario Panorama and other news sources reported the addition of more names before the end of the day, and several more suspects were named and arrests were made in the following week.* * * * * \n\nOn August 31, the family of Juan Requesens went to the International Red Cross to give them information about the medical conditions of Requesens. Here, they also spoke to the media there about the other people also incarcerated, who were likely experiencing the same treatment, and noted that several of those prisoners had not even been to court. Requesens' lawyer, Joel Garc\u00eda, also mentioned his concern for the other prisoners. The sister of Colonel Zambrano said at this time that her brother had not been seen by family or lawyers, either, and that guards had told her he wouldn't be available for thirty days. She was also concerned for the colonel's health, because his custodians had been requesting antibiotics, serums, and diuretics for him. A lawyer representing several of those accused of the attack said she had not been given access to any of them or their files.\n\nAnother Justice First deputy, Fernando Alb\u00e1n, was later arrested on suspicion of plotting the magnicide on Friday, October 5. He was detained in the SEBIN HQ also, but was reported dead the following Monday, October 8. Government officials claimed it was suicide, which was disputed. his friends, family, opposition political parties and Luis Almagro, Secretary General of the Organization of American States, argue that the councilor's death was murder.\n\n==Reactions==\n===Domestic===\n\nThe Venezuelan government referred to the incident as a \"terrorist attack\". A press release from the Venezuelan Constituent National Assembly, written by Diosdado Cabello, said that they \"fiercely condemn the vile and cowardly attack against the constitutional President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\" and that the \"act of terrorism shows the hopelessness and frustration of the fascist right\", also expressing solidarity with \"the patriotic soldiers who were injured\". The leading opposition group in Venezuela, Frente Amplio Venezuela Libre (\"Venezuelan Liberation Front\"), expressed confusion as to the nature of the incident, saying that they can't know if it was \"an attack, a fortuitous accident, or any of the other stories being shared on social media\".\n\nTwo days after the explosions, on Monday 6 August, Maduro supporters rallied in downtown Caracas, waving flags and with painted faces. However, Reuters reporters on the scene said that there were only a few hundred people, most of whom were government workers, and with several telling the journalists that they had been instructed to attend to support Maduro's image.\n\nThere was immediate outcry among the opposition in the nation after Cabello incited a move to strip supposed plotters and National Assemblymen Julio Borges and Juan Requesens of their diplomatic immunity. The National Assembly Vice President  spoke out against the move, saying that the \"constitution is clear\" and \"only the Supreme Court of Justice has the authority to order a deputy's arrest, with congressional approval\". On 9 August, the National Assembly \u2013 Venezuela's parliament \u2013 requested that other nations ignore the arrest warrant on Borges, saying that it was \"political in nature and should not be recognised by any foreign court\".\n\nChavista politician Sergio S\u00e1nchez reported that people voicing anti-Maduro sentiment in the wake of the attack were being punished, citing a family from  in Caracas who were \"evicted [...] for making a political comment about the attack against the President\", adding that the government now \"relies on the fear of the people to maintain power\".\n\nFollowing the release of a video of opposition leader Juan Requesens giving statements wearing underwear stained with faeces, Venezuelans protested in the streets wearing underwear in a statement of moral support for Requesens. A group brought some of Requesens' t-shirts as an offering for his release among other tributes for political prisoners during a mass service held in San Crist\u00f3bal, the capital of his home state T\u00e1chira. The  released a statement condemning the arrest and imprisonment of Requesens, saying it was \u201carbitrary and illegal\u201d, campaigning for the government to release him and naming \u201cnumerous and gravely serious objections\u201d to his imprisonment, with the worst being the \u201cobscene, protuberant, impudent and even boastful [...] dissemination of [Requesens\u2019] alleged self-incrimination\u201d, saying that they will seek action against the government and aim to prosecute those at fault \u201conce the Rule of Law has been restored to our beloved Venezuela\u201d. The opposition deputy Gilber Caro stood in front of the National Assembly on August 14 and stripped to his underwear to send support to Requesens. He said that a man's dignity is not dependent on his state of dress.\n\nOn the Monday August 13, a protest march called \"La Patria Llama\" (\"The Fatherland Calls\") was held starting at the edge of Petare, Miranda and travelled through the Greater Caracas area to Parque Carabobo station. It was organised by Cabello for supporters of the Maduro government who want to \"bring to justice the extremists\", Cabello adding that these people \"would have to kill millions of Venezuelans\" to change the country.\n\n===International===\nThe attack was condemned by the governments of El Salvador, Nicaragua and Bolivia, as well as the FARC, a former terrorist group from Colombia. Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel further announced that his nation would supply unlimited aid to Venezuela and the Bolivarian Revolution. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke by phone with Maduro, giving his best wishes to the President and to the soldiers injured in the incident.\n\nUruguay and Spain both denounced the violence. The Spanish embassy also said that the crisis in Venezuela should be solved peacefully and democratically. Panama's president Juan Carlos Varela stated \"that accusing former President Santos is irresponsible of President Maduro\" and that \"on one hand we condemn violence, but on the other hand we also condemn the fact that they are making baseless accusations against heads of state\". Luis Almagro, Secretary General of the Organization of American States, stated that \"[t]he null credibility of the Maduro regime prevents knowing the truth of what happened\" and reiterated that he \"will always condemn the use of violence as a political tool\".\n\nA Brazilian court case was ongoing regarding the travel of Venezuelan migrants across the Brazil-Venezuela border, and it was closed on Sunday 5 August, the day after the attack, with Judge Helder Barreto suspending restrictions but closing the border to Venezuelans until stability was achieved on both sides. It was reopened shortly after the official bar, with the Brazilian Supreme Court saying the move was too reactionary and \"not justified\", commentators connecting the closure with an already strained situation gaining further \"raised tensions\" after the drone incident.\n\nThe European Union promoted a \"thorough and transparent investigation\" and demanded the Venezuelan government to recognize \"the constitutional powers of the National Assembly, including full respect for its prerogatives with respect to the parliamentary immunity of its members in accordance with the rights, legislation and established constitutional procedures\". The Venezuelan government condemned the European Union's response, stating that it is \"trapped in its irrational rhetoric\" and that the European body intends to \"ignore the terrorist actions\". Vice President of the Subcommittee on Human Rights of the European Parliament, Beatriz Becerra, condemned the arrest of Juan Requesens, stating \"Kidnapped, tortured, humiliated. [Juan Requesens] [a]n elected deputy. With all the constitutional guarantees abolished in Venezuela by a dictatorial regime. Please, Federica Mogherini and Antonio Tajani let's fulfill our commitment with a winner of the Sakharov Prize\". The Federal Foreign Office of Germany condemned the arrest of Requesens calling it a \"clear violation of parliamentary immunity\" and demanded a \"thorough and transparent investigation\".\n\n==== Colombia ====\n\nThe earliest and most prominent of blame accusations were those levelled against Colombia, with Maduro specifically naming the Colombian President Santos as orchestrating his assassination, saying he had \"no doubt\" about it. The Colombian government quickly denied this, stating that Santos was too preoccupied with his granddaughter's baptism to think about overthrowing Maduro. Another statement added that it is \"customary for Maduro to blame Colombia for any kind of problem in his country\", and on the following Monday Santos himself tweeted to Maduro telling him \"not to worry himself\", also restating his own attendance at the \"more important\" baptism on the Saturday.\n\nTwo days after the incident, on Monday, 6 August, the Colombian Civil Aviation Authority announced a ban on drones and multirotors at the Presidential procession for Iv\u00e1n Duque's inauguration the next day over fears of a similar incident, with the prohibition extending to a radius and altitude of 2 nautical miles, or 12,000 feet, from Plaza Bol\u00edvar, Bogot\u00e1. There were no drone attacks on the day, but it saw other attacks by FARC dissidents in which a police officer died and five people were injured.\n\n====United States====\n\nIn response to Maduro's accusations, the US National Security Advisor, John R. Bolton, denied US involvement in the attack and suggested that the incident could be \"a pretext set up by the regime itself\". Bolton also stated that if the Venezuelan government \"has hard information that they want to present to [the US] that would show a potential violation of U.S. criminal law, [they'll] take a serious look at it.\" On Monday, 6 August, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo restated that the United States government had no involvement.\n\nTelemundo reported that the US embassy told its citizens in Venezuela to \"find a safe place to stay, maintain a low profile, and avoid protests\". James Story, charg\u00e9 d'affaires at the US embassy in Caracas, met with Saab and Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza in the week following the incident. Arreaza told Fox News that Story said it was \"the will of the U.S. government to cooperate\".\n\nIn response to the United States stating it would cooperate, Maduro said he would allow the FBI to investigate the incident, saying that if \"the United States ratifies its offering for the FBI to cooperate in the investigations on the links in Florida [regarding] the plans of the August 4 assassination attempt and terrorist attack, [he] would accept it\".\n\nThe United States Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley was visiting the Colombian-Venezuelan border at C\u00facuta on Wednesday, 8 August, to discuss the migrant crisis, and commented that Maduro had caused the attack, that \"he did this by creating this chaos\" and that \"everyone needs to be loud against Maduro and force him to leave\". She also pledged $9\u00a0million USD in aid to Colombia to help support the Venezuelan migrants there.\n\n=== Others ===\n\nThe Venezuelan V\u00e1clav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent-winning satirical news site El Chig\u00fcire Bipolar posted an article the day after the detention of Juan Requesens showing a photoshopped image of Maduro holding a pokeball with the headline \"Nicol-ash Maduro announces open season on capture of political prisoners\", likening him to the character Ash from Pok\u00e9mon who has the mission to \"catch them all\". The site attributed the fictional quote \"We are going to catch them all, the 150 deputies that are out there, we already have Requesens, now we are going after Borges and Meowth of Team Rocket\" to \"Nicol-ash\".\n\n==Controversy==\n=== Assassination legitimacy ===\nThe Guardian reported that the allegations made by Maduro were \"too neat\" and quoted commentators who doubt the assassination legitimacy. International Crisis Group consultant Phil Gunson stated that \"[t]he official 'investigation' [is following course]: begin with the conclusions and work backwards\", and senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America David Smilde added that \"[Maduro will] use it to further restrict liberty and purge the government and armed forces\".\n\nPeruvian newspaper La Rep\u00fablica also wrote that \"[s]ome analysts suspect that the attack is a desperate farce\" and that \"[i]t would not be the first time that an unscrupulous government mounted this type of setup,\" comparing it to the burning of the Reichstag. The paper concluded that, \"genuine attack or mounted farce, basically it does not matter: Maduro has taken things to this point, which suggests bloody outcomes\".\n\nThe German international news service Deutsche Welle said that the only certainty about the attack is that \"[t]he only one benefitting from all this is Maduro himself\", noting that the President \"has claimed at least 20 coups or attacks against him, but not a single one has done him harm\". They called the incident \"'fake news'\" because \"[Maduro's] regime emerges from every actual or supposed attack stronger than before\", relating this to the crisis in Venezuela by saying that \"[e]ach incident further distracts from increasingly unbearable problems in the country\".\n\n=== Firefighter narrative ===\nAccording to initial reports after the explosion, the Associated Press stated that firefighters attended the scene and claimed that a gas tank located in the Don Eduardo apartment block had exploded during the rally, the explosion caught part of the building on fire and had to be put out. An independent investigation by NGO Control Ciudadano did conclude, in regards to drone explosions, that \"[t]he nearby building explosion was coincidental.\"\n\nEfecto Cocuyo visited the building and reported that all apartments received piped gas, which does not require gas tanks. They could not say if there was also a gas tank. Video later provided by Telemundo did indeed appear to show a drone crash into the side of the apartment building. Days after the event, Bellingcat's investigation stated that the report by firefighters was an \"early narrative\" and that a \"second drone crashed and exploded [...] and is the most likely cause of the fire which the Venezuelan firefighters described\".\n\n=== Use of drones ===\nMedia outlets in Spain and Ecuador quoted a soldier in the rally who claimed he saw no drones, but heard something \"like a grenade\". El Pa\u00eds says Maduro's version of events is not credible. Former Venezuelan military aide Anthony Daquin talked to NTN24 about the incident and criticised the assassination theory, explaining that the event was a no-fly zone and any drones in the area would have been operated by the government.\n\nAnother theory arose of accidental drone failure causing the incident, with The Guardian reporting an independent investigation had been opened by the NGO Control Ciudadano and its head Roc\u00edo San Miguel, a military expert, which claimed that \"at least one drone belonged to the military, who lost control of the device inflight. Soldiers then shot it down.\" She repeated this statement later in a broadcast of Con La Luz with Efecto Cocuyo on 9 August, saying that \"it was a mistake by the military and Presidential Honor Guard, and I believe that they destroyed the drones\".\n\nAccording to former Venezuelan Vice Admiral Mario Carratu, claims that the drones were shot down by gunfire is inaccurate because \"[p]lastic explosives can't be detonated with bullets. They more likely exploded prematurely due to poor preparations by the hit team\".\n\nOne piece of investigative journalism said that drones were involved, but it \"[ruled] out the bizarre explosives claim\", citing inconsistencies between the injuries of \"an otherwise unscathed soldier with a cut on his head\" and damage caused by use of C4, which it says would \"destroy everything within a football field from the center spot\".\n\nThe Venezuelan ambassador to Barbados spoke on 7 August, saying that drones are actually completely banned in Venezuela. One of Maduro's television presentations had the President \"insist\" that the drone that exploded at the stage was loaded with gunpowder and lead, not C4, but the one that hit the building had gunpowder and C4.\n\n==See also==\n\n* Colombia\u2013Venezuela relations\n* 2018 Bulawayo bombing, an assassination attempt of a similar nature that occurred in Zimbabwe a month earlier.\n* La Guaira naval attack, failed raid against Nicol\u00e1s Maduro organized by former United States Army Special Forces operative Jordan Goudreau in 2020.\n\n\n==References==\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequesens holding his arm against SEBIN agents during arrest, while the camera is being turned away.\nleft.\nN\u00e9stor Reverol shares information on the suspects.\nPress release from the Venezuelan Constituent National Assembly.\nJuan Manuel Santos (left) in April 2018.

{"title":"2019 Abqaiq\u2013Khurais attack","article":"On 14 September 2019, drones were used to attack the state-owned Saudi Aramco oil processing facilities at Abqaiq (Biqayq in Arabic) and Khurais in eastern Saudi Arabia. The Houthi movement in Yemen claimed responsibility, tying it to events surrounding the Saudi Arabian intervention in the Yemeni Civil War and stating they used ten drones in the attack launched from Yemen, south of the facilities. Saudi Arabian officials said that many more drones and cruise missiles were used for the attack and originated from the north and east, and that they were of Iranian manufacture. The United States and Saudi Arabia have stated that Iran was behind the attack while France, Germany, and the United Kingdom jointly stated Iran bears responsibility for it. Iran has denied any involvement. The situation has exacerbated the Persian Gulf crisis.\n\nThe attack caused large fires at the processing facility which, according to the Saudi Arabian interior ministry, were put out several hours later. Both facilities were shut down for repairs, cutting Saudi Arabia's oil production by about half \u2013 representing about 5% of global oil production \u2013 and causing some destabilization of global financial markets. Saudi Arabia's energy ministry said that the country would tap into its oil reserves to maintain export levels until the facilities return to full capacity by the end of September.\n\n== Background ==\nSaudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter, having produced about 12 million barrels of petroleum products per day in 2017. Its proven oil reserves are the second-largest of any country, after Venezuela, and represent about 16% of the world's total.\n\nSaudi Aramco, a national oil company owned by the Saudi Arabian government, operates several oil drilling, transport, and production facilities across Saudi Arabia. It is the second-largest oil producer in the world, behind Russia's Rosneft.\n\nAramco says the Abqaiq facility is \"the largest crude oil stabilization plant in the world\"; it converts sour crude into sweet crude oil by removing sulfur impurities before it is transported to downstream refineries, processing more than 7 million barrels of oil per day, about 7% of global oil production. Bob McNally, a former member of the United States' National Economic Council and National Security Council, told Reuters that \"a successful attack on Abqaiq would be akin to a massive heart attack for the oil market and global economy\". The Abqaiq facility had been the site of a failed suicide bombing by Al-Qaeda in 2006. The Khurais oil field, also operated by Aramco, produces about 1.5 million barrels of crude a day, and is estimated to hold up to 20 billion barrels of oil.\n\nThe Abqaiq oil facility was protected by three Skyguard short-range air defense batteries. Neither the Skyguards nor the other Saudi air-defense weapons \u2014 MIM-104 Patriot and Shahine (Crotale) \u2014 are known to have brought down any of the attacking weapons. A CNBC report offered multiple potential explanations, including that Patriot is optimized for interceping \"high-altitude ballistic missiles\" and that the Saudi troops operating the defenses \"have 'low readiness, low competence, and are largely inattentive.'\" The Guardian newspaper wrote that the defenses \"would likely have been pointed across the Gulf towards Iran and south towards Yemen, but at least some of the missiles and drones are believed to have struck from the west.\" On 26 September 2019 Defense News published remarks by the Israeli air and missile defense expert Uzi Rubin, in which he characterized the Abqaiq-Khurais attack as \"as a kind of 'Pearl Harbor,'\u201d saying \"it will spark a lot of solutions\u201d to the tactic of using unmanned aerial vehicle swarms plus low-altitude, high-speed cruise missiles.\n\n== Attack ==\n\nAt around 4:00\u00a0a.m. Saudi Arabia Standard Time (UTC+3), Saudi Aramco reported fires at its Abqaiq and Khurais facilities. At the time, about 200 people were in the Khurais facility, according to Aramco officials. The fires were contained a few hours later, according to officials. They said no one died in the incidents, though they left unclear whether anyone was injured in the attack.\n\nSaudi Arabia's interior ministry said a few hours later that the fires were \"a result of ... drones\". Several unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) were reported to be involved. A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen, stated that 25 drones and missiles were used. Guards at the facilities reportedly tried to bring down the drones with machine gun fire, as captured on surveillance recordings of the facilities. According to Aramco, the drone strikes were in at least two waves; as they were evacuating the Khurais facility and dealing with fires from the first attack, another round of drones struck the facility.\n\nAnalysis of satellite images of the Abqaiq facility before and after the attacks appear to show 19 individual strikes: 14 that punctured storage tanks, three that disabled oil processing trains, and two more that damaged no equipment. A US interim report found that the attacks originated from the north.\n\nAccording to the NCRI, the attack came from the Omidiyeh military base in Ahvaz.\n\n== UAV defense ==\nSaudi Arabia's missile defense system failed to stop the swarm of drones and cruise missiles that struck the oil infrastructure. It is reported that Saudi Arabia has at least one MIM-104 Patriot missile defense system in place at Abqaiq. The missile defense system used was designed to mitigate threats from \"high flying targets.\" Unmanned aerial vehicles and cruise missiles fly at an altitude too low to be detected by conventional radar systems. A swarm of drones and cruise missiles coming from multiple directions can confuse and jam radar, as well as overwhelm air defenses. In addition to the Patriot system, at least four shorter-range defense systems were present, yet also failed to detect and mitigate the drone attack. Drones are too difficult to detect by traditional methods; drones are also cheap and extremely accessible. The drones used may have cost around $15,000 or less to build. According to Justin Bronk, research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, \"the cost curve is very favorable to the attacker, meaning Saudi Arabia would have to spend far more than its enemies to protect against additional strike capabilities. As such, there is almost no way the Kingdom can completely defend against such attacks.\" For more information on counter UAS technology refer to:  Counter Drone Systems 2018.\n\n== Attackers ==\nIn an initial report on 14 September 2019, the Saudi Arabian interior ministry did not identify the source of the attack, but stated they had begun an investigation. A statement from the French Foreign Minister in the early stages after the attack came on 17 September 2019, when he said \"\u201cThe Houthis ... announced that they launched this attack. That lacks credibility,\u201d but he went on to reference an ongoing international investigation, saying \"let\u2019s wait for its results.\"\n\nHours after the attack, the Houthis said in a statement that they sent ten newly developed drones equipped with propellor and turbojet engines to disable the oil production facilities, and vowed to send more against a wider range of Saudi targets. They said they attacked in retaliation for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, which began in 2015, has killed thousands of Yemeni civilians, and has created a famine and a humanitarian crisis described in 2019 as the worst in the world. A military spokesman for the Houthis said, \"These attacks are our right, and we promise the Saudi regime that the next operation will be wider and more painful if blockade and aggression continues\".\n\nIn the weeks before the Abqaiq\u2013Khurais attack, similar drone strikes on Saudi Arabian oil production infrastructure had caused no significant damage. The frequency of Houthi attacks has increased through 2019, with the targets including a Saudi airport.\n\nThe military spokesman said that the Sept. 14 attacks came after a \"careful intelligence operation, prior monitoring and cooperation from honorable and freedom-seeking people within the kingdom\". The use of operatives inside Saudi Arabia would appear to address some of the technical objections about how the Houthis could have struck targets at such a distance.\n\nOn 16 September, the Houthis warned of more attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure, and warned foreigners to leave Saudi oil plants.\n\nThey had displayed some of their long-range UAVs to the media in July 2019. The range of the drones reportedly can reach distant areas in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The Houthis had often used Samad 1 to attack Saudi Arabia. Later, the Houthis used the Quds 1, which is a small ground launched cruise missile that was possibly used in the 12 June 2019 Abha International Airport attack, which occurred in southwestern Saudi Arabia. A Houthi leader, Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, said that they have \"exploited vulnerabilities in the Saudi defense system\" and they \"built their drones in order to avoid these systems, therefore, the Saudi and the Emirati airspace became open to us after their defense system failed to even spot our drones\".\n\nHouthi rebels have previously advocated targeting Aramco. The Rapidan Energy Group and the Center for Strategic and International Studies had both warned that the site of the attack was a vulnerable target.\n\nAt a press conference on 18 September, Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said that they had launched a serious attack and Americans were using fabricated satellite images in an attempt to portray the resulting damage as having had been minimal. He presented aerial photos of the Abqaiq and Khurais facilities, from before the attack, and said that they had been taken by Yemeni drones. He said that the Houthis had launched the attack from three locations. Third-generation Qasif drones were launched from one position, Samad-3 drones from a second position, and from a third position they had launched newly-developed drones which use cluster heads, capable of dropping four accurate, independently-targeted bombs. He said that they would soon display these  newly-developed drones. He stated that they were now capable of manufacturing drones rapidly.\n\nYahya Sarea threatened the United Arab Emirates which is part of the Saudi-led coalition, saying that they have a list of targets inside the UAE among them Dubai and Abu Dhabi. He said if the UAE \"wants peace to its buildings which are made of glass and can't handle an attack by the Yemeni drones then leave Yemen alone\". In response, UAE officials told The Telegraph newspaper that an attack by Houthis on tourism and global business hubs, would be an attack on the world.\n\nJean-Yves Le Drian, France's Minister of Foreign Affairs, stated on 19 September that preliminary findings from the investigation appear to rule out the Houthis' involvement and their claim \"lacks credibility\", but there would be no definitive conclusion until the international investigation is complete.\n\nOfficials for the United States had rejected the Houthis' claims, and instead said that Iran was responsible for the attacks. In the months prior, tensions between Iran and the United States created a crisis in the Persian Gulf, coupled with Iran's violations of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action related to their nuclear program in July 2019. On the day of the attacks, an unnamed senior U.S. official said that Iran, not the Houthis, were behind the attack, which involved some dozen cruise missiles and more than 20 drones. The U.S. said that it was working with Saudi Arabia to help investigate the attack and assure the facilities and energy supplies are secure and stable; US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Iran was behind the attacks. US President Donald Trump initially stopped short of definitively blaming Iran for the attack, saying in an 18 September 2019 Newsweek article that \"it was 'looking like' Iran was behind the attack.\"\n\nRoyal Saudi Air Force Colonel Turki al-Malki, a spokesperson for the Saudi-led coalition, issued a statement on 16 September saying that the drones appear to have been based on Iranian drones and that they were unlikely to have been launched from Yemen, counter to the claims of the Houthis. However, al-Malki said the coalition was still trying to determine the origin of the drones. At a press conference on 18 September, al-Malki showed debris of the drones, stating there were 18 drones and 7 missiles used in the attack (25 weapons in total), with the drones being delta wing-style craft of Iranian manufacture. Al-Malki showed surveillance footage that had, according to him, caught the drones traveling southward towards the facilities before the strike. He stated that this ruled out Yemen as a point of origin due to the range they would have had to have travelled. He concluded that this evidence \"point[s] to Iran\", and that the attack was \"unquestionably sponsored by Iran\". Iranian Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Amir Hatami stated in response to this new evidence, \"These accusations are wholly, seriously and firmly rejected. It's easy to accuse someone without providing any proof.\"\n\nOn 17 September 2019, an unnamed senior U.S. official told CBS News that the U.S. had identified the location in Southern Iran from which they believe the drones and cruise missiles were launched, while two U.S. Department of Defense officials told NPR  that they had detected Iran preparing drone flights at multiple launch sites in Iran before the attack. Saudi Arabia has not reached the same conclusion that Iran was the staging ground for the attacks, becoming increasingly confident but not totally convinced, with the United States due to share more intelligence with Saudi Arabia. The United States stated it would provide evidence at the 2019 United Nations General Assembly that the attack involved cruise missiles from Iran. For example, the United States has stated it has \"circumstantial evidence\" that Iran launched the strike from its own soil in the form of satellite imagery which shows Iran readying drones and missiles at launch sites in Iran before Saudi oil facilities were attacked.\n\nLate on 18 September, a U.S. official speaking to CBS News said that Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Khamenei had signed off on the attacks but only on the assurance that the method of the attack would allow Iran to deny involvement. Coupled with the Saudi evidence, the U.S. official stated that some of the attacks were launched from the Iranian Ahvaz Air Force Base, about  from the targets, and flew through Kuwaiti air space.\n\nFrance, Germany and the United Kingdom, who had been trying to calm relations between the United States and Iran, made statements reported on 17 and 18 September 2019 to the effect that they would conduct an investigation prior to announcing conclusions.  On 23 September, while meeting at the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a joint statement \"It is clear to us that Iran bears responsibility for this attack. There is no other plausible explanation.\"  The three leaders committed to continuing their investigation on the attack and urged Iran to alter their course to avoid elevating further hostilities in the areas.\n\nIran has denied these statements and said that they were \"blind, incomprehensible and meaningless\" and warned the U.S. that it was \"ready for fully-fledged war\" with them should there be retaliation against Iran.  Instead, Iran stated that the Houthis (whom they reportedly support in the Yemeni Civil War) were responsible for the attack. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has stated that \"Yemeni people are exercising their legitimate right of defence\u2026 the attacks were a reciprocal response to aggression against Yemen for years.\" The Iranian Ministry of Defence has also rejected the statements about Iranian involvement and said, \"the issue is very clear: there has been a conflict between two countries (Yemen and Saudi Arabia)\".\n\nIn December 2019, the UN said that its investigation was not able to confirm the Saudi official claim that the weapons used in the attack are of Iranian origin. According to a confidential report by U.N. sanctions monitors seen by Reuters said that \"despite their claims to the contrary, the Houthi forces did not launch the attacks on Abqaiq and Khurais on 14 September 2019.\"\n\nAccording to a report by the Middle East Eye, an anonymous Iraqi intelligence official said the attacks were launched from Southern Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces bases in retaliation to Israeli drone strikes on the Iraqi forces in August that were reportedly funded by Saudi Arabia. A CBS correspondent stated that the damage at the Abqaiq facilities reportedly was on the western-northwestern portions, which would have been difficult for the Houthis, located to the southwest, to have hit with drones. The BBC reported that satellite images showed damage on the western side of Abqaiq.\n\nThe office of the Prime Minister of Iraq denied that its territory was used to carry out the attacks and vowed to act \"decisively\" against anyone using Iraqi territory to attack other countries. The U.S. has also stated that Iraqi territory was not used.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n=== Market impacts ===\n\nSaudi Arabian officials stated that the attacks forced the shutdown of the facilities, cutting the country's oil production from 9.8 to about 4.1 million barrels of oil a day, losing 5.7 million barrels of oil a day or about 5% of global production. Initially, spokespeople stated that the plants were expected to return to their nominal capacity by 16 September 2019, and would use reserve oil to make up for the shortfall. However, other officials for the Saudi government estimated the time to restore full production would be \"weeks, not days\".\n\nThe day after the attack, the Saudi stock market fell 2.3% in Sunday trading on 15 September. Commodities and stock markets as well as other financial indicators jumped on worldwide market openings on Monday, 16 September. Brent Crude oil futures prices surged almost 20 percent, the largest surge in the commodity's price since the 1990 Invasion of Kuwait. Other markets also saw impacts from concerns on the oil supply, including U.S. gasoline and heating oil, and the gold market.  Impact to the U.S., which had doubled its oil production in the last decade and was now the world's largest producer, was expected to be immaterial.\n\nBy Tuesday, 17 September, Saudi Arabian officials from the energy ministry stated that the repairs to the Abqaiq facility will be much faster than originally anticipated. The Abqaiq facility was operating at 2 million barrels per day within 48 hours of the attack. The energy ministry said full production could be restored within two to three weeks, by the end of September. Further, the nation planned no reduction of current oil exports, and will use reserve storage to maintain the current levels. These announcements were seen to help calm markets, as oil market prices and other financial indicators dropped during trading on 17 September from the spike the previous day, though still remained at elevated levels which are expected to have impacts on prices across the globe. To expedite repairs, Aramco shipped in equipment from the United States and Europe.\n\nThe state-owned Saudi Aramco had been in the initial stages of planning its initial public offering (IPO) of about 5% of the company ownership of the estimated  valuation of the company over the next few years. This IPO was originally to have started in 2018 but there were concerns about its finances and corporate structure. Industry analysts said that the September 2019 attacks will further delay this IPO until new concerns related to security against terrorism attacks and the ability to restore production after such an incident are proven, as well as the impact on the price of oil. Saudi Aramco later stated that recovery from the attack is not going to be as fast as initially expected, putting the IPO at risk of further delay. Ultimately, the IPO was launched in December 2019, with 1.5% of the company put to public trading on the Tadawul exchange; it became the largest IPO ever at  raised, and valuing the company at , making it the largest listed company at launch.\n\nOn 27 September, Bloomberg News reported that while production capacity and exports implied that the industry was almost back to normal, that view may be overly simplistic, with output 1.8 million barrels a day below the pre-attack level and capacity reported to be only 700,000 barrels below the Kingdom's maximum. Until further repairs and adjustments, customers may be asked to accept heavier oil than the grades originally purchased.\n\n=== Domestic reactions ===\n\nThe Saudi King, Salman bin Abdulaziz, issued a statement on 17 September, calling the attack a \"vandalism and coward attack\" that threatens international security and global energy supplies and said the kingdom is able to respond to these attacks. The king also said the attack comes after a series of attacks against the kingdom.\n\n=== International reactions ===\nThe attacks raised concern over political stability in the Middle East, coupled with the US' stance that the attacks may have originated from Iran.\n\nThe United States is a close ally of Saudi Arabia, while its relationship with Iran has been strained in 2019 as part of the overall Persian Gulf crisis. U.S. President Donald Trump authorised the release of the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help stabilize energy prices in the US.  Trump further stated that the U.S. is no longer dependent on oil from the Middle East. Trump condemned the attack and stated on Twitter on 15 September that the U.S. military is \"locked and loaded\" but is waiting to hear from the Saudis as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, \"and under what terms we would proceed\". In the days that followed, Trump stated that he did not promise to protect the Saudis, but will have to sit with them and \"work something out\". On 20 September, Trump issued a new round of economic sanctions against Iran, targeting the Central Bank of Iran and the National Development Fund of Iran, preventing them from purchasing American dollars; these sanctions had been established earlier but had been previously lifted after Iran had agreed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The sanctions are aimed to prevent Iran from having the funds to support future strikes.\n\nOn 15 September 2019, Reuters reported on remarks by international organizations by stating \"U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Saturday\u2019s attacks and called on all parties to exercise restraint and prevent any escalation. The European Union warned the strikes posed a real threat to regional security, and several nations urged restraint.\" Russian president Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked about the U.S. statements that Iran was behind drone strikes, said: \"We have a negative attitude towards rising tensions in the region and call for all countries in the region and outside of it to avoid any hasty steps or conclusions which may deepen destabilisation.\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying, said in remarks quoted 16 September 2019 that while there is no \"conclusive investigation\", it is irresponsible to blame anyone for the attack, and added \"we call on relevant parties avoid taking actions that bring about an escalation in regional tensions\".\n\nOther nations called for waiting for results from investigations before stating who was behind the attack.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said on 17 September 2019: \"We have to look at how the conflict in Yemen started. This country was completely destroyed \u2013 who caused it?\" That same day, Japan's defence minister said his country has not seen any intelligence showing Iranian involvement in the attacks.  \"We are not aware of any information that points to Iran,\" Defence Minister Tar\u014d K\u014dno told reporters at a briefing.  \"We believe the Houthis carried out the attack based on the statement claiming responsibility.\" Also on 17 September 2019, White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said the Trump administration \u201ccan\u2019t say definitively\u201d that Iran was behind the attack. As of 18 September 2019, the United Arab Emirates had not yet attributed responsibility.\n\nSeveral international bodies and nations condemned the attack. The UN Secretary General condemned the attacks on Saudi Arabia, claimed by the Houthis, and UN Special Envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths said the attack \"carries the risk of dragging Yemen into a regional conflagration\" and that \"there is 'no time to waste' in ending four years of fighting between Houthi rebels and the internationally-recognized Government, supported by a Saudi-led coalition, which has pushed the country to the brink of famine.\" Arab League in a statement by the General Secretariat on 14 September, strongly condemned the drone attacks and termed the attacks as \"serious escalations\" and called for preserving security of the country. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg \"strongly condemned\" the attacks and said Iran was \"supporting different terrorist groups and being responsible for destabilising the whole region.\" In South Korea, the National Defence Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo denounced drone attacks on oil facilities as \"a reckless act\" that harms global security and stability. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed to strengthen partnerships between the two countries to fight against the terrorist attacks.\n\nDuring the Houthi \"21 September revolution anniversary\", the Houthi leader Muhammad Ali al-Houthi, offered to halt all attacks on Saudi Arabia. He said that Saudi Arabia should in return end its war in Yemen. The Houthis also warned that if Saudi Arabia refused their peace offer the next attacks will be more painful. The UN Yemen envoy, praised the Houthi announcement and said it could send a \"powerful message of the will to end the war\".\n\n=== Related security issues ===\nOn 15 September 2019, the Cabinet of Kuwait said it was probing the sighting of a drone over its territory and coordinating with Saudi Arabia, and other countries, after the attacks. Kuwait has also increased its security as a result of the attack.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin offered to sell Saudi Arabia the advanced S-400 missile system so it could use it against air attacks instead of continuing to use the Raytheon Patriot missile system. However, Putin made this offer beside a chuckling Iranian President Rouhani in what was described as a \u201csublime bit of political trolling\u201c.\n\nBy 11 October 2019, the United States had sent 3,000 additional troops to Saudi Arabia in response to the attack, which U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper stated was to address \"threats in the region\" while protecting Saudi Arabia from \"Iranian aggression\". Secretive cyberattacks on Tehran internet capabilities followed the event and according to Iranian sources, a rocket attack on Iranian shipping in the Red Sea.\n\nUzi Rubin, a prominent Israeli military expert, described the attack as one of the most audacious military surprises ever and a landmark event that bolstered Iran's prestige domestically and internationally in defiance of the US sanctions.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* Airstrikes on hospitals in Yemen\n* Dahyan air strike\n* Iran\u2013Saudi Arabia relations\n* Petroleum politics\n\n== References
