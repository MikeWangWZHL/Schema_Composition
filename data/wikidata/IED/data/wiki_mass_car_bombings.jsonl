{"title":"2019 Bogot\u00e1 car bombing","article":"On 17 January 2019, a vehicle was driven into the General Santander National Police Academy in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. The truck forced its way into the facility, hit a wall and detonated, killing 22 people (including the perpetrator) and injuring 68 others. Suicide attacks are unusual in Colombia. The car contained about  of pentolite. It was the deadliest attack on the Colombian capital since the 2003 El Nogal Club bombing and the first terrorist attack on the capital since the 2017 Centro Andino bombing. The National Liberation Army (ELN) accepted responsibility for the attack and justified it as a response to the bombings made by the Colombian government during the unilateral ceasefire.\n\n==Background==\n=== Colombian conflict ===\nThe Colombian conflict started in 1964, although systematic violence in the country can be dated since the end of the 19th century (Thousand Days' War). The National Liberation Army (ELN) is one of the most prominent participants of the ongoing conflict. For decades, residents of Bogot\u00e1 lived in fear of being a victim of a bombing by leftist rebels or Pablo Escobar's Medell\u00edn drug cartel. But as Colombia's conflict has wound down, and the nation's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent.\n\nSporadic attacks have affected the city since the peace deal was initiated. The most prominent was an explosion at the upmarket Andino shopping mall in June 2017 which killed three people, including a French woman, and injured another 11. Police later arrested several suspected members of a far-left urban guerrilla group called the People Revolutionary's Movement for the bombing.\n\n=== Peace dialogue ===\nThe 2016 peace deal between the FARC and Colombian government resulted in the ELN gaining strength in the region. The Colombian government has attempted to establish peace dialogue with the ELN since 2017, though ELN groups have rejected conditions placed by the government, such as the end of criminal actions including violent attacks and kidnappings. The ELN, however, persisted that the Colombian government should continue dialogue without making any demands towards the group. Between 2017 and up until the attack, Colombian officials stated that the ELN had participated in at least 400 terrorist attacks in the nation since dialogue began, including the shoot down of a civilian helicopter and the kidnapping of its occupants.\n\n=== ELN in Venezuela ===\nAccording to InSight Crime, the ELN and FARC dissidents allegedly met together in Venezuela to form a potential alliance in October 2018. Sources based in the Arauca department in Colombia provided the information, with reports that the groups would participate in illicit activity together. It was also alleged that former FARC commander Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez participated in the talks with the ELN.\n\nIn November 2018, InSight Crime also reported that the ELN was present in over twelve Venezuelan states, spanning from the Colombia-Venezuela border in the west across Venezuela and into Brazil and Guyana to the east. Insight Crime states that Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was tolerant of the ELN, explaining that \"ELN\u2019s expansion in Venezuela has been marked by the Maduro administration\u2019s inaction and even encouragement towards the group\", with reports from Venezuelan NGO Fundaci\u00f3n Redes that the Venezuelan military had possibly armed ELN members.\n\n==Events==\n\n=== Planning ===\nAttorney General  identified the perpetrator as Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez, known as \"Mocho Kiko\" because of his missing hand due to a previous explosion, a 57-year-old from the northern department of Boyac\u00e1. Rojas is alleged to have been involved with the ELN for three decades and served as an intelligence chief for a branch of the group. Since 2011, Rojas is alleged to have been teaching guerrilla militants in Venezuela how to construct explosives.\n\nRicardo Carvajal, who was previously investigated for drug trafficking in 2012 but was acquitted of the charges, allegedly contracted Rojas for the bombing due to his experience. The bombing, according to Colombian authorities, had been planned for more than ten months. In May 2018, Colombian records show that Rojas purchased a 1993 Nissan Patrol from Mauricio Mosquera, who was previously charged with terrorism and rebellion. On 27 July 2018, the vehicle was officially inspected in Arauca, Arauca, a city found on the border of Colombia and Venezuela where the ELN mainly controls territory.\n\n=== Attack ===\nThe authorities stated that on 17 January 2019 at 9:30am, Rojas drove his grey 1993 Nissan Patrol loaded with  of pentolite to the campus of the General Santander National Police Academy and dropped off a passenger at a nearby bus stop. Rojas then reportedly drove his truck down a side street used for deliveries to make his way onto the campus. When a detection dog signaled explosives on the vehicle, the driver forced his vehicle through a security checkpoint and struck security guards. The explosives in the truck were then detonated near the women's dormitories at the police academy as students were leaving a promotion ceremony. It is unknown if the driver detonated the explosives or if it was possibly the individual he left near the bus stop who remotely triggered the device.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, the authorities began investigating Rojas's possible connections to either the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla movement, the Clan \u00dasuga organized crime gang, or FARC dissidents.\n\n=== Initial investigations ===\nOn 18 January, Defence Minister  identified Rojas Rodr\u00edguez as a long-time member of the ELN, within which he served as an explosives expert. Investigators were able to identify Rojas with security camera footage and fingerprints from his remaining hand.\n\nA second individual, who Attorney General Mart\u00ednez said \"had participated in the attack\", was arrested in Bogot\u00e1 at 2:30am on the day following the attack.  The individual was identified as Ricardo Carvajal after he allegedly confessed to the bombings over a telephone call investigators intercepted. He was found with a \"combatant's manual\" and numerous coveralls. Carvajal Salgar denied that he was involved in the attack and his family stated that the coveralls were used for the jobs he worked.\n\nAccording to Colombian authorities, there are on-going operations throughout Bogot\u00e1 and the department of Arauca to capture other individuals suspected of having been involved in the attack, and that the ELN was responsible despite the organization not taking claim for the attack as it has done in the past.\n\n=== Peace dialogue ends ===\nPresident Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez announced on 18 January that peace dialogue between the Government of Colombia and the ELN was officially suspended. Duque also demanded that Cuba extradite the ten ELN leaders that found refuge on the island nation during peace talks and the reactivation of their Interpol Red Notices, and he criticized Venezuela for providing refuge for the ELN on the Colombia-Venezuela border. In response to the request, Cuba's Foreign Minister announced that Cuba would abide by the protocols of ongoing negotiations between both parties.\n\nThe President of the National Constituent Assembly of Venezuela, Diosdado Cabello, denied any Venezuelan involvement in the attacks on 18 January. On 21 January, Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo called for a \"concrete response\" from the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela on whether the ELN was present in Venezuela, explaining that prior to the attack, the Colombian government asked the Venezuelan government on the potential presence of ELN groups in Venezuela without a response. Holmes Trujillo also stated that the Maduro government had taken \"evasive positions\" when speaking about the ELN.\n\n===Claim of responsibility===\n\nELN accepted the responsibility for the attack, saying the bombing was carried out in retaliation for the Colombian government not honoring the ceasefire by carrying out attacks on its camps. It justified that government and the cadres of its security forces had therefore become legitimate targets and called for resuming peace dialogue. High Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos spoke out against its members being sheltered anymore now that it had claimed responsibility.\n\n==International reactions==\nA foreign national, identified as a female cadet from Ecuador, was killed in the attack, while three nationals from Panama, one from the United States and another also from Ecuador were wounded. Their respective governments have expressed their condemnation for the attack and assistance to their citizens.\n\n* Cuba: Cuba shared condolences with Colombia, with its foreign ministry stating Cuba \"will act with strict respect for the Protocols of Dialogue and Peace signed by the Government and the ELN, including the Protocol in Case of a Rupture in Negotiations\".\n* Ecuador: President Len\u00edn Moreno lamented the death of Erika Chic\u00f3, the Ecuadorian cadet killed in the attack, and expressed his condolences to Colombia. He also announced that he was to send Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner to Bogot\u00e1 accompanied by Chic\u00f3's relatives.\n* Panama: The Panamanian embassy in Bogot\u00e1 expressed its indignation at the attack, and provided a phone number for information about Panamanian cadets affected.\n* United States: The Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Kimberly Breier condemned the bombing and said: \"Our condolences and sympathies go to the victims and family members of those killed\", while the U.S. Embassy in Bogot\u00e1 offered its \"help in investigating this reprehensible attack\".\n\nArgentina, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, and the Organization of American States also condemned the attack.\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2019\/jan\/17\/car-bomb-explodes-at-police-academy-in-bogota","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190117200743\/https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2019\/jan\/17\/car-bomb-explodes-at-police-academy-in-bogota","https:\/\/www.eltiempo.com\/justicia\/investigacion\/pistas-sobre-el-ataque-con-carro-bomba-a-escuela-de-cadetes-de-la-policia-315988","http:\/\/caracol.com.co\/radio\/2019\/01\/17\/nacional\/1547744968_857681.html","https:\/\/www.eluniversal.com.co\/colombia\/lo-que-se-sabe-del-atentado-contra-la-policia-en-bogota-DF610261","https:\/\/www.kienyke.com\/krimen\/actos-terroristas-en-bogota","http:\/\/www.banrepcultural.org\/biblioteca-virtual\/credencial-historia\/numero-121\/guerra-de-los-mil-dias-reclutamientos-ascensos-y-deserciones","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2019\/jan\/17\/car-bomb-explodes-at-police-academy-in-bogota","https:\/\/www.eltiempo.com\/bogota\/explosion-en-centro-comercial-andino-de-bogota-100084","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/the_americas\/colombia-asks-cuba-to-arrest-eln-negotiators-for-car-bombing\/2019\/01\/18\/b2eb5a2e-1b87-11e9-b8e6-567190c2fd08_story.html?noredirect=on","http:\/\/www.lapatilla.com\/2019\/01\/18\/duque-clausura-dialogo-con-eln-en-cuba-y-lanza-velada-advertencia-a-venezuela\/","https:\/\/www.elheraldo.co\/colombia\/la-barbarie-golpea-colombia-589741","https:\/\/www.insightcrime.org\/news\/analysis\/farc-dissidents-eln-turn-venezuela-criminal-enclave\/","https:\/\/www.insightcrime.org\/news\/analysis\/eln-present-half-venezuela\/","https:\/\/www.elheraldo.co\/colombia\/soy-inocente-me-estan-culpando-de-algo-que-no-hice-ricardo-carvajal-590073","https:\/\/amp.theguardian.com\/world\/2019\/jan\/18\/bogota-bombing-police-academy-one-armed-bomb-expert-eln","https:\/\/www.eltiempo.com\/justicia\/jose-aldemar-rojas-rodriguez-fue-el-autor-material-del-atentado-en-escuela-de-policia-315766","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-latin-america-46904683","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190117191015\/https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-latin-america-46904683","https:\/\/www.eltiempo.com\/justicia\/conflicto-y-narcotrafico\/primeras-hipotesis-de-atentado-contra-escuela-de-policia-en-bogota-315758","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-latin-america-46922719","https:\/\/lta.reuters.com\/articulo\/colombia-ataque-idLTAKCN1PC11E-OUSLT","http:\/\/www.tribtown.com\/2019\/01\/18\/lt-colombia-bombing-the-latest-2\/","https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2019\/01\/colombia-asks-cuba-extradite-eln-rebels-bombing-kills-21-190120075529616.html","http:\/\/www.lapatilla.com\/2019\/01\/21\/colombia-maduro-respuesta-presencia-eln-venezuela\/","https:\/\/edition-m.cnn.com\/2019\/01\/21\/americas\/colombia-car-bomb-eln\/index.html?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F","https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/world\/colombia-eln-rebels-car-bomb-responsibility-1.4986955","https:\/\/www.eltiempo.com\/justicia\/delitos\/extranjeros-muertos-o-heridos-en-atentado-a-la-escuela-de-policia-en-bogota-315756","https:\/\/www.elespectador.com\/noticias\/el-mundo\/las-reacciones-de-la-comunidad-internacional-al-atentado-en-bogota-articulo-834528","https:\/\/twitter.com\/embpanamacol\/status\/1085940725265719297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1085940725265719297&ref_url=https:\/\/www.elespectador.com\/noticias\/el-mundo\/las-reacciones-de-la-comunidad-internacional-al-atentado-en-bogota-articulo-834528","https:\/\/www.france24.com\/en\/20190117-several-killed-suspected-car-bomb-blast-police-academy-bogota-colombia","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190117202955\/https:\/\/www.france24.com\/en\/20190117-several-killed-suspected-car-bomb-blast-police-academy-bogota-colombia","https:\/\/twitter.com\/PatoBullrich\/status\/1085950246507741185","http:\/\/agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br\/politica\/noticia\/2019-01\/bolsonaro-repudia-ataque-terrorista-na-colombia","https:\/\/www.elespectador.com\/noticias\/el-mundo\/las-reacciones-de-la-comunidad-internacional-al-atentado-en-bogota-articulo-834528","https:\/\/twitter.com\/Almagro_OEA2015\/status\/1085945458202198020?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1085945458202198020&ref_url=https:\/\/www.elespectador.com\/noticias\/el-mundo\/las-reacciones-de-la-comunidad-internacional-al-atentado-en-bogota-articulo-834528"]}
{"title":"Maidan Shar attack","article":"On 21 January 2019, in central Afghanistan, the Taliban attacked a military compound in Maidan Shar, killing officers of the Afghan National Directorate of Security. The Taliban attacked while engaging in the process of negotiating a truce with the United States. The attack began when an explosives-laden car rammed through a military checkpoint and onto the grounds of the compound, where the vehicle detonated. After the explosion, two gunmen entered the base and opened fire on Afghan soldiers, before the two were shot down. A senior official in the Afghan defense ministry said that 126 people were killed in the explosion. The Taliban claimed responsibility and stated that over 190 people were killed in the attack. The Afghan National Directorate of Security (NDS) reported that 36 military personnel were killed in the attack. Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack and said that the 'Afghan intelligence agency personnel were target of the attack'.\n\n==Attack==\nThe attackers rammed a vehicle filled with explosives through a military checkpoint and detonated it in the camp of the National Directorate of Security (NDS) forces training center in Maidan Shar, the capital of Maidan Wardak Province. Following the explosion, two to five Taliban gunmen entered the campus and shot at Afghan soldiers before being fatally shot during the clashes. According to the Defence ministry officials, the Taliban used a Humvee vehicle which they had taken from government forces to house the bomb. Wardak provincial council member, Abdul Wahid Akbarzai, claimed that the attackers had dressed in Afghan special forces uniform. The attack took place on the same day when Taliban representatives met Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. special envoy for Afghan peace talks, in Qatar. Sharif Hotak, a member of the provincial council in Maidan Wardak, said, \"the explosion was very powerful. The whole building has collapsed.\"\n\n==Casualties==\nLocal officials said that no official confirmation regarding the casualty toll of troops and NDS personnel had been made, adding that officials said not to discuss the figure with the media due to the fear of damaging morale. NDS reports showed 36 killed and 58 injured. Mohammad Sardar Bakhyari, deputy head of the provincial council stated at least 65 were killed in the military base. Another source in Maidan Wardak Province reported that more than 100 members of NDS were killed in the attack. Sharif Hotak said \"many more were killed\" and he saw bodies of 35 Afghan soldiers in the hospital. Hotak asserted that the government was hiding the casualty figures. Khawanin Sultani, a provincial council member, said the attack left over 70 wounded. Zabiullah Mujahid, spokesman of Taliban insurgents, claimed 190 people were killed in the attack.\n\n==Reactions==\nPresident Ashraf Ghani's office called the attackers \"enemies of the country\" and said that \"they killed and wounded a number of our beloved and honest sons\".\n\nBahram Ghasemi, a representative of Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, condemned the attack and expressed sympathy for the victims' families.\n\nThe Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, expressed condolences to the families affected by the attack.\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, President of Turkey, condemned the attack and expressed his condolences to Ghani.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan condemned the attack and said \"the United States stands with the people of Afghanistan, who seek a peaceful future and an end to the violence\".\n\n==Public uprising force==\nAfghan security officials claimed that the base, where the attack took place, was run by Afghan National Directorate of Security (NDS) to train 'public uprising forces', a pro-government militia. They claimed that the many men who were killed in the attack were members of the militia who they had been training. In the past, Afghan security officials have denied any relation with such militia and claimed that those militia are organic movements of locals who are staging 'uprising' against the Taliban. So for the first time, Afghan security officials acknowledged that they are supporting public uprising forces. Sharifullah Hotak, a member of Wardak provincial council, claimed that the base was used by NDS to train and equip members of public uprising forces. However, Afghan security officials claims were contradicted by Ghani, who claimed that only National Directorate of Security personnel were the target of the attack.\n\n==Aftermath==\nOn January 23, NDS said they killed the attack organiser along with seven militants in an airstrike. The Taliban rejected the NDS statement, describing it as \"propaganda\". Similarly, residents and local officials in the areas also contradicted Afghan security officials claims. Sharifullah Hotak, member of Wardak provincial council, claim that 6 civilians were killed in the airstrike.\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-afghanistan-attack\/taliban-attack-kills-more-than-100-security-personnel-in-central-afghanistan-defense-ministry-source-idUSKCN1PF0FC","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/01\/21\/world\/asia\/afghanistan-taliban-attack-intelligence-wardak.html","https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/afghanistan-taliban-attack-military-compound-maidan-shahr-wardak-us-peace-talks\/","https:\/\/www.dhakatribune.com\/world\/south-asia\/2019\/01\/21\/taliban-attack-kills-126-security-personnel-in-afghanistan","https:\/\/www.apnews.com\/7341cda9e36d44499338a835c5a7aca8","https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/world\/taliban-attack-on-military-base-kills-at-least-65-afghan-officials-say","https:\/\/www.indiatoday.in\/world\/story\/taliban-attack-on-afghanistan-military-base-kills-over-100-1436197-2019-01-22","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/01\/21\/world\/asia\/afghanistan-taliban-attack-intelligence-wardak.html","https:\/\/www.dailysabah.com\/asia\/2019\/01\/21\/more-than-100-afghan-forces-killed-in-taliban-attack","https:\/\/www.abc.net.au\/news\/2019-01-22\/taliban-attack-on-afghan-security-base-kills-more-than-100\/10735200","https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/world\/south-asia\/around-65-killed-in-taliban-attack-on-afghan-intel-base-local-official\/articleshow\/67637878.cms","https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2019\/01\/taliban-kill-12-attack-afghan-military-base-190121061133642.html","https:\/\/en.mehrnews.com\/news\/141770\/Iran-condemns-deadly-attack-on-Afghan-military-compound","https:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/latest\/422215-pm-imran-khan-offers-condolence-to-people-of-afghanistan-over-terror-attacks","https:\/\/www.business-standard.com\/article\/news-ani\/us-to-support-kabul-in-achieving-peace-reconciliation-post-wardak-attack-119012200930_1.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/01\/21\/world\/asia\/afghanistan-taliban-attack-intelligence-wardak.html","https:\/\/www.business-standard.com\/article\/news-ians\/mastermind-of-military-base-attack-killed-afghan-intelligence-agency-119012300931_1.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/01\/23\/world\/asia\/afghanistan-taliban-airstrike.html"]}
{"title":"2019 Pulwama attack","article":"On 14 February 2019, a convoy of vehicles carrying security personnel on the Jammu Srinagar National Highway was attacked by a vehicle-borne suicide bomber at Lethpora (near Awantipora) in the Pulwama district, Jammu and Kashmir, India. The attack resulted in the deaths of 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel and the attacker. The responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Pakistan-based Islamist militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed. The attacker was Adil Ahmad Dar, a local from Pulwama district, and a member of Jaish-e-Mohammed. India has blamed Pakistan for the attack. Pakistan condemned the attack and denied any connection to it.\n\n==Background==\n\nKashmir is a disputed territory, claimed both by India and Pakistan with both countries administering part of the territory. Pakistan has sought to gain control of Indian-administered Kashmir. An insurgency began to proliferate in Indian-administered Kashmir in the late 1980s. Pakistan provided the insurgency with material support. Since 1989, about 70,000 people have been killed in the uprising and the Indian crackdown. According to Time, unrest in Kashmir grew in 2016 after India killed a popular militant leader, Burhan Wani. A rising number of young locals from Indian administered Kashmir have joined the militancy. Many sources state that the majority of militants in Kashmir are now local, not foreign. In 2018 alone, the death toll included 260 militants, 160 civilians and 150 government forces.\n\nSince 2015, Pakistan-based militants in Kashmir have increasingly taken to high-profile suicide attacks against the Indian security forces. In July 2015, three gunmen attacked a bus, and police station in Gurdaspur. Early in 2016, four to six gunmen attacked the Pathankot Air Force Station. In February and June 2016, the militants killed nine and eight security personnel respectively in Pampore. In September 2016, four assailants attacked an Indian Army brigade headquarters in Uri killing 19 soldiers. On 31 December 2017, the Commando Training Centre at Lethpora was also attacked by militants killing five security personnel. These attacks took place in the vicinity of the Jammu Srinagar National Highway.\n\n== Attack ==\n\n\nOn 14 February 2019, a convoy of 78 vehicles transporting more than 2,500 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel from Jammu to Srinagar was travelling on National Highway 44. The convoy had left Jammu around 03:30 IST and was carrying a large number of personnel due to the highway having been shut down for two days prior. The convoy was scheduled to reach its destination before sunset.\n\nAt Lethpora near Awantipora, around 15:15 IST, a bus carrying security personnel was rammed by a car carrying explosives. It caused a blast which killed 40 CRPF personnel of the 76th Battalion and injured many others. The injured were moved to the army base hospital in Srinagar.\n\nPakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed claimed responsibility for the attack. They also released a video of the assailant Adil Ahmad Dar, a 22-year old from Kakapora who had joined the group a year earlier. Dar's family had last seen him in March 2018, when he left his house on a bicycle one day and never returned. Pakistan denied any involvement, though Jaish-e-Mohammed's leader, Masood Azhar, is known to operate in the country.\n\nIt is the deadliest terror attack on India's state security personnel in Kashmir since 1989.\n\n===Perpetrator===\nThe perpetrator was identified as Adil Ahmad Dar (alias Adil Ahmad Gaadi Takranewala or Waqas Commando), a 22-year old from Kakapora. According to Dar's parents, Dar became radicalized after he was beaten by Indian police. Between September 2016 and March 2018, Adil Dar was reportedly arrested six times by Indian authorities. However, each time he was released without any charges.\n\n==Investigation==\nThe National Investigation Agency dispatched a 12-member team to probe the attack, working with the Jammu and Kashmir Police.\n\nInitial investigations suggested the car was carrying more than  of explosives, including  of RDX, a high explosive, and ammonium nitrate. Lt Gen Hooda said that the explosives might have been stolen from a construction site. He initially said that it was not possible that they were smuggled from across the border, but later said that he could not rule it out.\n\nNational Investigation Agency was able to establish and confirm the identity of suicide bomber as DNA samples from \"meagre fragments of the car\" used in suicide attack matched with Adil Ahmad Dar's father. However, even after a year of investigation, NIA was unable to trace the source of explosives. \n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n\nState funerals of security personnel killed in the attack were held in their respective native places. The government of Punjab announced ex gratia compensation of  each to the families of the killed  security personnel from the state and a government job to the next of kin. India revoked Pakistan's most favoured nation status. The customs duty on all Pakistani goods imported to India were raised to 200%. The government of India urged the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) to put Pakistan in the blacklist. The FATF decided to keep it on 'grey list' and gave time till October 2019 to comply with 27 conditions laid in June 2018 when it was put on the 'grey list'. Failing comply, it will be added in the blacklist. On 17 February, the state administration revoked security provisions for separatist leaders.\n\nProtests, bandhs and candle light marches were held across India. There were violent protests in Jammu resulting in a curfew being imposed starting 14 February. The Indian community in the United Kingdom held protests outside the Pakistan High Commission in London. A delegation of Indian doctors cancelled their visit to Pakistan for the 13th Association of Anaesthesiologists Congress, organised  by the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, in Lahore on 7 March. Indian broadcaster DSport said it would no longer broadcast Pakistan Super League cricket matches. The All Indian Cine Workers Association announced a ban on Pakistani actors and artists in the Indian film industry, and stated that strong action would be taken on any organisation violating it. The Indian Film and Television Directors' Association also announced a ban on Pakistani artists in films and music produced in India; the president of the organisation threatened to \"vandalise\" the sets of any Indian film production with Pakistani artists.\n\nOn 20 February 2019, Pakistani prisoner Shakarullah, who was serving a life term in India's Jaipur Central Jail under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, was stabbed and beaten to death by four other inmates. India claimed that Shakarullah was allegedly killed in a brawl among the inmates over television volume. Pakistan claimed that he was killed in retaliation of the Pulwama incident.\n\n===Gunfight with the militants===\nFollowing intelligence inputs, in the early morning hours of 18 February, a joint team comprising 55 Rashtriya Rifles, CRPF and Special Operations Group of India killed two terrorists and two supporters in an anti-terrorism encounter operation in the ensuing manhunt for the perpetrators in Pulwama. One of them, Abdul Rasheed Ghazi alias Kamran, was identified as a Pakistani national and was considered the mastermind of the attack and a commander of the terrorist group Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM). In addition, local JeM recruit Hilal Ahmed, along with two sympathisers who housed Ghazi and Ahmed to evade capture, were also shot dead in the encounter. Four security personnel were killed in the gunfight.\n\n===Anti-Kashmiri backlash===\nKashmiri students living in other parts of India faced a backlash after the attack, including violence and harassment, and eviction from their homes. In response, many Indians offered to house Kashmiris who may have been evicted.\n\nIt was reported that number of Kashmiris fleeing from the rest of India had reached \"hundreds\". Jammu and Kashmir Students Organisation reported that 97% of Kashmiri students in Dehradun had been evacuated. Two Indian colleges in Dehradhun announced that no new Kashmiri students will receive admission. One of those colleges, Alpine College, suspended its dean, who is a Kashmiri, after some groups called for him to be fired.\n\nTathagata Roy, the governor of the Indian state Meghalaya, tweeted support for a boycott of \"everything Kashmiri\". Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad disagreed with this view. A Kashmiri merchant was beaten in Kolkata; the attack was condemned by West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee.\n\nKashmir police chief Dilbagh Singh said they had asked affected states to protect students.\" Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah met with Rajnath Singh seeking assistance.\n\n===Balakot airstrike===\n\nOn 26 February, twelve Mirage 2000 jets of the Indian Air Force crossed the Line of Control and dropped bombs into Balakot, Pakistan. India claimed that it attacked a Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp and killed a large number of terrorists, reported to be between 300 and 350. Pakistan claimed that they quickly scrambled jets to intercept the IAF jets, who dropped their payloads to quickly return over the Line of Control.\n\n===India-Pakistan standoff===\n\nOn 27 February, Pakistan Air Force conducted an airstrike into Jammu and Kashmir in retaliation for the Indian airstrike the day before. Both Pakistan and India agreed that no damage was caused by Pakistan's airstrike. However, in an ensuing dogfight between Indian and Pakistani jets, an Indian MiG-21 was shot down over Pakistan and its pilot captured. Pakistan released the pilot on 1 March.\n\n===Pakistan arrests suspects===\nOn 5 March, Pakistan arrested 44 members of various groups, including the Jaish-e-Muhammad. Some of those arrested had been named by India in a dossier it gave to Pakistan in the aftermath of the Pulwama attack. Pakistan said those arrested will be held for at least 14 days, and if India provided further evidence they would be prosecuted. Among those arrested were relatives of JeM leader Masood Azhar, including his son Hamad Azhar and his brother Abdul Rauf.\n\n==Reactions==\n===India and Pakistan===\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the attack and expressed solidarity with the victims and their families. Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh assured that a strong response will be given to the terror attack. India blamed Pakistan for the attack. BBC News has said that the involvement of the Jaish-e-Mohammed in the bombing \"directly links\" Pakistan to the attack, while also pointing out that Jaish-e-Mohammed had attacked Pakistani military targets in the past. It is widely accepted among security analysts that Jaish-e-Mohammed is the creation of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence. Pakistan banned the group in 2002, but it has resurfaced under different names and retains ISI's support. The New York Times questioned the nature of the link to Pakistan, pointing out that the bomber came from Indian-administered Kashmir and the explosives may also have been locally procured.\n\nThe Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that India would completely isolate Pakistan in the diplomatic community.\n\nPakistan denied the allegation of a link to the attack, and Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi condemned the bombing. Fawad Chaudhry, Pakistan's federal information minister, said that  Pakistan was taking action against Jaish-e-Muhammad and that Pakistan would be able to assist India in taking action against terrorist groups. The Nation, a Pakistani newspaper, called the assailant a \"freedom fighter\" who eliminated members of an \"occupying force\". Pakistan and India both recalled their ambassadors for \"consultations\" in a tit-for-tat move.\n\nOn 19 February 2019, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said that providing safe haven to terrorists was not in Pakistan's interest. He asked for proof of Pakistani involvement and warned India that any military response would be met with retaliation. Indian Ministry of External Affairs responded by criticising him for not condemning the attack and not offering any condolences for the victims. It said that claims by Adil Ahmad Dar and Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed was sufficient proof. It said that promises of investigation was unconvincing due to a lack of progress in Mumbai and Pathankot attack investigations. In response to Indian criticism, the newspaper Dawn pointed out that Pakistani Foreign Minister Qureshi had expressed sympathies with the victims soon after the attack.\n\nFollowing the attack on the Indian territory, the producers of the Indian Hindi films, including Notebook, Kabir Singh and Satellite Shankar, decided not to release the films in Pakistan.\n\nFormer Indian cricket players and Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) called for the boycott on the 2019 World Cup group match fixture between India and Pakistan with raising concerns on banning Pakistan cricket team from playing in the 2019 Cricket World Cup tournament. However, after conducting a press meet in Dubai, the International Cricket Council (ICC) rejected BCCI's statement regarding banning Pakistan from the World Cup and assured that the scheduled match will go ahead as planned despite the ongoing standoff between the two nations.\n\nOn 8 March 2019, the India national cricket team wore camouflage military caps in tribute to the CRPF personnel killed in the attack during the third ODI against Australia at Ranchi. The players also donated their match fees to the National Defence Fund. The Pakistan Cricket Board wrote to the ICC to protest the gesture. The ICC stated that BCCI had asked for, and received, permission to wear the caps.\n\n===International community===\nThe United States condemned the attack and added it would work with India in counterterrorism efforts. It asked Pakistan to stop sheltering terrorists and urged it to cooperate with the investigation and punish those responsible. Pakistan said it was ready to cooperate with such an investigation. A statement from the US Department of State noted that Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) had claimed responsibility for the attack. Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, France, Hungary, Israel, Maldives, Nepal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom condemned the attack, as did the United Nations Secretary-General. China and Turkey also defended Pakistan's efforts to fight terrorism. China placed a temporary block on a UN Security Council resolution following the attack, which was backed by all other permanent members of the council, to designate JeM leader Masood Azhar as a global terrorist.\n\nIran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with India's External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and referring to both the 2019 Pulwama attack and the 2019 Khash\u2013Zahedan suicide bombing, he stated that Iran and India would work together to prevent future attacks.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe Indian cricket team paid tribute to the 40 soldiers killed in the Pulwama attack by wearing the camouflage caps instead of the usual sky blue team India cap, during the third One Day International match with Australia in Ranchi. Pakistan objected to this gesture and Pakistani Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry and Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi called the International Cricket Council (ICC) to ban the Indian team for allegedly mixing cricket with politics. The Pakistani Cricket Board formally raised the matter with the ICC. The ICC clarified that the Indian team had requested and was granted permission by the ICC to wear the camouflage caps as a part of fundraising drive and to pay tribute to the soldiers killed in the attack.\n\n==See also==\n* List of terrorist incidents in India\n* Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir\n* India\u2013Pakistan relations\n* 2016 Uri attack\n\n== Notes

{"title":"14 October 2017 Mogadishu bombings","article":"On 14 October 2017, two truck bombings took place in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, killing at least 587 people and injuring 316 others. Almost all of the casualties were caused by one of the trucks, which detonated when the driver, while attempting to escape from security officials, crashed through a barrier and exploded in the Hodan District, destroying a hotel; the intended target of the attack is believed to have been a secure compound housing international agencies and troops. The second blast happened close by, killing two people. A third explosives-laden truck was captured by police.\n\nThough no organisation claimed responsibility, officials stated that a key member of the cell that carried it out told them Islamist group Al-Shabaab was responsible.\n\nThe attack is the deadliest in Somalia\u2018s history, surpassing the 2011 Mogadishu bombing that killed 100 people, and the deadliest bombing in Africa. It is also the third deadliest terrorist bombing attack and the sixth-deadliest act of terrorism in modern history, surpassed only by the 1990 massacre of Sri Lankan Police officers in Sri Lanka, the 2008 Christmas massacres in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 2007 Yazidi communities bombings, the 2014 Camp Speicher massacre in Iraq, and the September 11 attacks in the United States. In response to the bombings, Somali president Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed declared three days of mourning.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the summer of 2011, the East African region faced a drought and shortage of food supplies, particularly in the Somali region, forcing tens of thousands of people to cross the borders into Ethiopia and Kenya for refuge. Al-Shabaab, a jihadist fundamentalist group designated as a terrorist organization by several countries, threatened to expel the aid groups working in the area before the African Union's AMISOM troops took action to force the al-Shabaab fighters out of the region.\n\nIn July 2010, al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for a bombing in Kampala, Uganda, in retaliation for Uganda's support to, and presence in, AMISOM.\n\nIn 2017, Somalia was continuing to suffer its worst drought in 40 years, with climatic catastrophe compounded by war and poor governance. Al-Shabaab banned humanitarian assistance in areas it controls, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to choose between starvation or brutal punishment.\n\nThe United States had a military involvement in Somalia until 1994, and had then withdrawn. Earlier in 2017 the US designated Somalia a \"zone of active hostilities\" (allowing it to apply looser rules and oversight concerning the authorization of drone strikes and ground operations), and the deployment of regular US forces to Somalia was again authorized. This saw America\u2019s ground forces in Somalia increase from about 50 in 2016 to 400 in 2017.\n\nThe bombings occurred amidst deep public discontent and political divisions between federal and regional leaders.\n\n== Attacks ==\nOn 14 October 2017, a large truck filled with explosives was detonated at a busy crossroads near the Safari Hotel in the Hodan District, at least a kilometre from the Medina Gate. The effect of the bombing was compounded by a fuel tanker parked nearby that caused a massive fireball. Sources close to the government said that the truck contained 350\u00a0kg of home-made and military-grade explosives. The truck had been briefly detained at a checkpoint, but was allowed to proceed after local authorities vouched for it; it was then stopped by security officials while stuck in a traffic jam. When it was about to be searched, the driver accelerated and crashed through a barrier, and the truck exploded. The Safari Hotel collapsed, trapping many under its rubble, and the Qatari embassy was severely damaged.\n\nAccording to a Somali intelligence official investigating the attack, the truck was overloaded and covered with a tarpaulin. The dust on it aroused the suspicion of soldiers at a checkpoint just outside Mogadishu. The soldiers ordered the driver to park and get out, with the assailant calling a well-known man who vouched for the truck. After passing the checkpoint, the truck sped through another one where the soldiers fired at it and flattened one of its tires. The driver parked on a busy street and detonated it. A senior police official investigating it stated that it was packed with 2 tonnes (2.2 U.S. tons) of explosives.\n\nA Toyota Noah minivan loaded with explosives was also intercepted and stopped; it later detonated without casualties.\n\nOfficials said that the target of the attacks was the heavily guarded Mogadishu airport compound, where the United Nations, most embassies, and the headquarters of the 22,000-strong AMISOM, are based. The minivan was to blast open the Medina Gate entrance to the compound to allow the truck with more explosives to be driven in and detonated. The possibility of complicity of personnel manning vehicle checkpoints was being investigated, after claims the first truck was stopped at two checkpoints en route to Mogadishu without any cargo inspection.\n\nA second bombing occurred about 30 minutes later, less than 300 metres away, killing two people in the Medina district.\n\n== Victims ==\nAs of 4 March 2018, at least 587 people had been confirmed killed. The explosion took place on one of the busiest streets in Mogadishu; victims included senior civil servants, five paramedic volunteers, a journalist, an American-Somali man, a medical student and 15 children. The full death total may never be known with certainty, as the remains of many people would not be found due to the intense heat (which could be felt 100 metres away from the scene), and others were buried quickly by relatives following Islamic custom. Around 160 bodies could not be recognised, doctor Aden Nur said, and they were buried by the government the day after the bombing. Over a hundred injured were taken to the Madina hospital\u2014one of six overcrowded nearby hospitals.\n\n==Perpetrators==\nWhile no group has admitted responsibility, officials believe the attack was made by a cell of the group al-Shabaab, following statements made by a key member, a veteran militant who had taken part in previous attacks in Mogadishu, with investigators believing the attack may have been motivated out of desire for revenge for the botched United States-led raid on his hometown in August. He was arrested while driving a second explosives-packed vehicle into the city on the day of the explosion. An official said that the man had confessed, and was proud of what he had done, which he said was for jihad. Another official said that the bombs were hidden under rice, sugar and other goods in the truck. The driver was detained but a local businessman and tribal leader vouched for the truck. The official stated they were investigating whether the attackers had help from within the security forces. A Somali intelligence official stated that the man who vouched for the truck had been arrested.\n\nIn February 2018, a military court in Mogadishu sentenced two people to death for their role in the bombings. According to the court, Hassan Aden Isak was driving a truck intended to be used in a second bombing on the day. Ibrahim Hassan Absuge was sentenced in absentia for the bombings as well, and is also accused of masterminding the November 2016 Mogadishu car bombing, which killed 20 people.\n\n== Reactions ==\n===Domestic===\nThe Somali president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, declared three days of national mourning. He and hundreds of other Somali citizens donated blood. \"Today\u2019s horrific attack proves our enemy would stop (at) nothing to cause our people pain and suffering. Let\u2019s unite against terror,\" he said on Twitter. \"Time to unite and pray together. Terror won\u2019t win.\"\n\n===International===\nThe United States Department of State expressed condolences to victims and wished a quick recovery for the injured. It called the attack \"senseless and cowardly\" and said it would stand with Somalia against extremism.\n\n== See also ==\n* Mogadishu bombing (disambiguation), a list\n* 2017 timeline of the War in

{"title":"May 2017 Kabul attack","article":"On 31 May 2017, a truck bomb exploded in a crowded intersection in Kabul, Afghanistan, near the German embassy at about 08:25 local time (03:55 GMT) during rush hour,\nkilling over 150 and injuring 413, mostly civilians, and damaging several buildings in the embassy. The attack was the deadliest terror attack to take place in Kabul. The diplomatic quarter\u2014in which the attack took place\u2014is one of the most heavily fortified areas in the city, with  blast walls, and access requires passing through several checkpoints. The explosion created a crater about  wide and  deep. Afghanistan's intelligence agency NDS claimed that the blast was planned by the Haqqani Network. Although no group has claimed responsibility, the Afghan Taliban are also a suspect but they have denied involvement and condemned the attack.\n\n==Background==\n\nKabul is held by the NATO-supported Afghan Government, though both the Taliban and Islamic State were able to launch destructive attacks on the capital in the preceding months.\n\nReferring to the wider conflict, in April the Taliban announced a new offensive, saying their main focus would be foreign forces. The United States has been considering sending additional troops to Afghanistan to help stabilize the country.\n\n==Attack==\nA vacuum truck was filled with about  of explosives and then detonated near the German embassy.\nThe blast occurred at 08:25 local time, during rush hour, at one of the busiest areas of Kabul: near Zanbaq Square next to the German embassy. \nAt least 90 people were killed and 400 injured. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani later updated this total, stating, \"Over 150 entirely innocent Afghan sons and daughters were killed and more than three hundred were brought to hospital with burns, lacerations, and amputations.\" The blast was said to have done damage 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) away. The blast created a crater over  deep. The majority of the victims were civilians. Casualties included Mohammed Nazir a driver for BBC News, a staff member of Tolo News, a female German diplomat and an Afghan security guard for the German embassy.\n\nInjuries were reported among the Japanese and German diplomatic missions. Various embassies sustained damage to their buildings.\n\n==Responsibility==\nNo group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Both the Taliban and Islamic State had claimed responsibility for earlier Kabul bombings in 2017, although the former issued a statement denying responsibility for the attack. The National Directorate of Security (NDS) claimed that the blast was planned by the Afghan insurgent group Haqqani Network, and reiterated allegations that those elements had support and presence across the border in Pakistan. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Nafees Zakaria rejected the Afghan allegations as \"baseless\".\n\n==Aftermath==\n;June anti-government protest\nAnti-government protests broke out in response to the May 31 bombing, with protesters continuing their ongoing complaints about the lack of security provided by government forces in dealing with insurgents and terrorist attacks. They demanded removal of President Ashraf Ghani's shaky government and pushed for formation of an interim administration, at least partly for its failure to stop the attacks. The protesters chanted anti-American and anti-Pakistani slogans, demanded execution of militant inmates and accused the government of being too lenient in the fight against the insurgents. The June 2 protest became violent after some demonstrators continued moving forward after entreaties by police to stop several hundred meters away from the presidential palace, witnesses said. Security forces opened fire and used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the crowd. At least five demonstrators died and another 15 were wounded; the son of deputy head of Senate Salim Ezadyar, was one of those killed.\n\n;Funeral bombing\n\nOn June 3, following the death of deputy head of Senate Salim Ezadyar's son at the Kabul anti-government protest the previous day, his funeral took place. This funeral proceeded as scheduled despite authorities warning that militants could target any gathering as they had done the year before. During the funeral, three consecutive explosions took place, killing at least 18 Afghans and wounding dozens more. No immediate claim of responsibility for the attack was made.\n\n==Reactions==\n\n===Domestic===\n* : President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack and called it \"cowardly.\" The Afghanistan Cricket Board, in the wake of the attack, cancelled friendly matches it had scheduled with Pakistan to be played in Kabul and Lahore, in addition to other mutual commitments barring international fixtures.\n\n===International===\n* : Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland stated that \"the timing of this cowardly attack during the holy month of Ramadan was deliberate\" and Canada \"will never cease in our efforts to prevent violent extremism and to bring perpetrators of such violence to justice.\"\n* : President Giorgi Margvelashvili issued a statement offering \"condolences to the families of the killed ones\" and saying he would \"stand by the people and the government of Afghanistan.\"\n* : Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the attack and stated that \"terrorism has no borders.\" The German Federal Government stated they would temporarily suspend deportations of failed asylum seekers to Afghanistan.\n* : Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated: \"India stands with Afghanistan in fighting all types of terrorism. Forces supporting terrorism need to be defeated.\" Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj said its embassy staff were safe. \n* : Speaking on behalf of the Indonesian Government, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi condemned the attack and stated that they wished for the quick recovery of the victims of the attack. The ministry later released an emergency hotline for relatives of Indonesians living in Kabul.\n* : Foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi condemned the attacks and stated that \"Iran will always stand with its neighbor, Afghanistan, in hard times\" and that \"Terrorist attacks, anywhere and with any motive or in any shape, are shameful and must be condemned\". \n* : The Government expressed its deep sorrow at the senseless act of violence and voiced its hope that the perpetrators will be brought to justice quickly. The Malaysian government also extends its deepest condolences and sympathies to the Government of Afghanistan and to the bereaved families.\n* : The Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement extending \"heartfelt sympathies and deepest condolences\" and condemning \"terrorism in all its forms and manifestations\" and stated that Pakistan firmly stands \"with our Afghan brothers in this hour of grief and anguish.\"\n\nOther statements of condemnation were reported from UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and the US embassy in Kabul.\n\n==See also==\n\n* List of mass car

{"title":"2017 Aleppo suicide car bombing","article":"On 15 April 2017, a car bomb detonated near a convoy of buses in the al-Rashideen neighbourhood of western Aleppo, Syria. The buses carried civilian evacuees from the besieged government-controlled towns of al-Fu'ah and Kafriya and were guarded by rebel fighters. The bombing killed at least 126 people including at least 80 children.\n\nThe bus evacuation was part of an agreement brokered by the Syrian government, Iran, and Qatar, and implemented by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent. Under the terms of the evacuation deal, residents of the Shia communities of al-Fu'ah and Kafriya, which supported the Syrian government and were surrounded by the Army of Conquest, would be transported to Aleppo. In return, residents of Madaya and Al-Zabadani, which are Sunni-majority and support the opposition, would be transported to the Idlib province.\n\n==Bombing==\n\n\nThe attack took place in the Rashideen district, in the western outskirts of the city of Aleppo, at about 15:30 local time. According to some journalists, the bomb was in a car that parked and began distributing crisps to attract children. This car was near the front of a convoy of buses that were stopped at a checkpoint to move injured refugees. An investigation by Bellingcat disputed that it was an aid vehicle, but instead a third-generation Hyundai Porter Super Cab, bearing a \"W77\" label and a yellow-green-red color scheme, of indeterminate affiliation.\n\nEarly reports indicated that a few dozen people had been killed, but the confirmed death toll rose to 126 by the following day, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Observatory said that 109 of the dead were refugees, including 68 children, with the remainder rebel fighters and aid workers, though a spokesman for the Ahrar al-Sham rebel group said that about 30 of its members were killed. According to the White Helmets civil defense group, 55 people were injured.\n\nThe bombing led to the suspension of evacuations for several days; they resumed on 19 April with tight security at the Rashideen checkpoint. Three days after the bombing, a United Nations spokesperson said that the bombing was \"likely a war crime\" and a person of interest seen in footage prior to the bombing is being investigated.\n\n==Perpetrator==\n\nThe perpetrator's identity is unknown. According to Syrian state television, the civilians of Fuaa and Kafriya supported the government during the rebel siege of the towns, and the rebels were responsible for the bombing. Ahrar al-Sham denied responsibility, and members of the opposition suggested that the Assad government might have been behind the attack as a way of diverting attention from the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack. Rami Abdulrahman, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), stated in a televised interview that he believed the bombing was not done by the Syrian government.\n\n==Reactions==\n\nSecretary-General of the United Nations Ant\u00f3nio Guterres requested that all parties guarantee the security of those waiting to be evacuated. Pope Francis condemned the bombing during his Easter Sunday address, calling it a \"vile attack on fleeing refugees\". Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassem called the attack \"a shameful criminal act by Takfiri terrorists\". The Turkish Foreign Ministry said that the attack \"has shown once again the necessity to strengthen the ceasefire agreement\".\n\nRobert Fisk, writing for The Independent, criticized the United States government for a double standard regarding the attack, contrasting its silence on the bombing with its reaction to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack earlier in the month; he said that \"after this weekend's suicide bombing [...] the White House said nothing [...] because\u2013and here's the point\u2013they were the victims of the wrong kind of killer.\"\n\n==See also==\n* 2015 Zabadani cease-fire agreement for the four-town evacuation agreement involving the buses\n* List of bombings during the Syrian Civil War\n\n==References==\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWitnesses narrations of the bombing.","urls":["http:\/\/www.al-monitor.com\/pulse\/afp\/2017\/04\/syria-conflict-evacuation-bombings-toll.html","https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/world\/evacuations-syria-bus-convoy-explosion-1.4071801","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-39609288","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-syria-idUSKBN17H04Y","http:\/\/www.abc.net.au\/news\/2017-04-17\/syrian-bus-bombing-kills-at-least-80-children\/8447104","https:\/\/www.alaraby.co.uk\/english\/politics\/2015\/4\/16\/syrian-regime-forces-lost-stomach-to-retake-idlib","https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/middle-east\/madaya-the-two-other-syrian-villages-where-20000-people-have-been-starving-under-rebel-siege-a6807941.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/04\/14\/world\/middleeast\/syria-towns-sieges-population-transfers-assad.html","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-middle-east-39613313","http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/dozens-killed-after-car-bomb-explodes-near-buses-carrying-syrian-evacuees\/","http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2017\/04\/explosion-hits-syrian-evacuation-convoy-aleppo-170415132111011.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170802184345\/https:\/\/www.bellingcat.com\/news\/mena\/2017\/08\/02\/digital-pursuit-of-suicide-truck\/","https:\/\/www.bellingcat.com\/news\/mena\/2017\/08\/02\/digital-pursuit-of-suicide-truck\/","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/04\/15\/world\/middleeast\/syria-aleppo-car-bomb.html","http:\/\/www.stltoday.com\/news\/national\/over-killed-during-syria-s-troubled-population-transfer\/article_f390240e-ab8c-53f9-807c-8a203aa2bcb4.html","http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/04\/15\/middleeast\/syria-evacuations-bombing\/","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-middle-east-39640055","https:\/\/www.un.org\/apps\/news\/story.asp?NewsID=56575","http:\/\/www.france24.com\/en\/20170419-syria-evacuations-resume-deadly-car-bomb-rashidin-qatar","https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/2017\/04\/15\/suicide-car-bomb-targeting-syrians-evacuated-rebel-held-area\/","http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/04\/15\/middleeast\/syria-evacuations-bombing\/","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2017\/apr\/15\/syria-aleppo-bombing-evacuees-rebels-killed","http:\/\/www.presstv.ir\/Detail\/2017\/04\/15\/518188\/syria-aleppo-iran-slams-takfiri-bus","https:\/\/www.dailysabah.com\/diplomacy\/2017\/04\/17\/turkey-condemns-deadly-attack-near-syrias-aleppo","https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/voices\/syria-suicide-attack-refugee-buses-trump-only-cares-sunni-children-a7687066.html"]}

Besides Iranians, people from Basra and Nasiriyah were also killed in the attack.\n\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for it.\n\n==Bombing==\nThe pilgrims were on their way back to Iran from the holy city of Karbala after participating in the annual Arba'een Pilgrimage. According to a police official, five buses filled with pilgrims stopped by a famous restaurant, next to a petrol station, burst into flames after the detonation of an \"explosives-laden truck\". According to a report, the bomb had been packed with 500 liters of ammonium nitrate.\n\nReportedly, the Hillah suicide truck bombing happened a day after dozens of bombings in and around Baghdad by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in which 31 people were killed and over 100 injured. There were some attacks during Arba'een this year, but these were insignificant compared to incidents in previous years.

{"title":"2016 Karrada bombing","article":"-->\n}}\n\n\nOn 3 July 2016, ISIL militants carried out coordinated bomb attacks in Baghdad that killed 340 civilians and injured hundreds more. A few minutes after midnight local time (2 July, 21:00 UTC), a suicide truck-bomb targeted the mainly Shia district of Karrada, busy with late night shoppers for Ramadan. A second roadside bomb was detonated in the suburb of Sha'ab, killing at least five.\n\nISIL issued a statement claiming responsibility for the attack, naming the suicide bomber as Abu Maha al-Iraqi. There were reports that the source of the blast was a refrigerator van packed with explosives. The explosion caused a huge fire on the main street. Several buildings, including the popular Hadi Center, were badly damaged. The bombing is the second-worst suicide attack in Iraq by death toll after the 2007 Yazidi communities bombings and the deadliest terrorist attack in Iraq carried out by a single bomber.\n\n==Background==\nThe 17 May 2016 Baghdad bombings, which killed over 101 people, were perpetrated by ISIL. Some security analysts saw the bombings in Iraq's capital as an effort to distract the attention of the Iraqi security forces from the then-ongoing battle in Fallujah. The 2016 Battle of Fallujah came to a close on 29 June with the Iraqi government recapturing the city from ISIL.\n\nThe Baghdad bombings were the third mass killing of civilians by ISIL militants in that past week, following the 28 June attack in Istanbul, Turkey, and the 1 July attack in Dhaka, Bangladesh. ISIL had sent out calls for increased attacks during the month long celebration of Ramadan.\n\n==Attack and response==\nThe suicide truck bomb hit a shopping area in the upper class Shia-majority district of Karrada, where many people were on the street during the evening shopping and breaking their Ramadan fast with iftar at local cafes. The bomb was concealed inside a refrigerator truck driven by a suicide bomber. It was the first major attack in Baghdad since the Iraqi government's recapture of the city of Fallujah just four days prior. A Western security source in Baghdad told the BBC the bomb used \"a new tactic which helped it to move undetected through checkpoints ... We've never seen it before, and it's very worrying.\" The bombers reportedly used a \"unique\" mix of chemicals for the bomb. \"We are used to big fires but the chemicals in this bomb were used for the first time in Iraq,\" according to Brigadier General Kadhim Bashir Saleh of the Iraqi Civil Defense Force.\n\nThe initial death toll directly due to the bombing had been \"limited\", but the fire caused by the bombing trapped people in shopping centres, which lacked any emergency exits. The bombing killed at least 324 people and injured at least 223. Unconfirmed reports state that the car bombs may have passed checkpoints where Iraqi security forces still use fake bomb detectors such as the ADE 651.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, Baghdad Operations Command claimed it had arrested members of a militant cell who were connected to the bombing.\n\n===Other attacks===\nA second roadside explosion occurred in the  neighborhood of Sha'ab in northern Baghdad around midnight, killing at least five people and injuring 16.\n\nA third bombing targeted members of al-Hashd al-Shaabi, killing one person and injuring five as well as damaging a vehicle. The bomb was an IED that detonated in Abu Ghraib District in Baghdad. A vehicle was also damaged.\n\nA fourth bombing in al-Latifiya in southern Baghdad killed one person. The bomb was placed under a civilian vehicle, and went off when the vehicle was being driven.\n\n==Casualties==\nThe Iraqi Ministry of Defence first stated that at least 167 had been killed and over 180 injured. Reports from the scene indicated that many of those killed were children. After initial reports, the death toll continued to rise as further corpses were recovered from the rubble and injured victims died of their injuries.\n\nAbdel Ghani Saadon, the general manager of Rusafa Health Directorate, issued a statement noting that the \"hospitals of al-Kandi, al-Sadr and Sheikh Zayed received 138 wounded and 70 dead bodies of al-Karrada bombing\". He noted that fifty bodies were burned beyond recognition, and that samples from them had been sent for DNA testing to determine their identities.\n\n==Responsibility==\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant issued a statement claiming that it was responsible for the attack and that it had deliberately targeted Shia Muslims, further identifying the suicide bomber as Abu Maha al-Iraqi.\n\nJasim al-Bahadli, a former army officer and security analyst in Baghdad, stated that the attack was an ISIL attempt to \"compensate for their humiliating defeat in Falluja\".\n\n==Reactions==\n===Domestic===\n====Political====\nThe Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi visited the scene of the attack on the following day, and was met by angry crowds shouting \"thief\" and \"dog\". They were angry about what they perceived as the government's false promises regarding tightened security. One local shop owner was quoted as stating \"Thank God I managed to hit Abadi with stones to take revenge for the kids\". Abadi stated that he will punish the perpetrators of the bombings. He also announced a public mourning that will last three days.\n\nAfter reporting in their most recent death toll, the Iraqi Ministry of Defence issued a statement admitting they were overwhelmed, with not enough resources, military checkpoints, and intelligence services to properly manage the security of Baghdad.\n\nOn 5 July, Interior Minister Mohammed Al-Ghabban resigned his post. The Interior ministry is responsible for police but not other forces providing security in Baghdad. In his resignation statement, al-Ghabban said that the security system was \"fundamentally flawed\" and called for changes to increase the ministry's power. Lieutenant General Abdulamir al-Shimmari, the head of Baghdad Operations Command, along with the Interior Ministry head of intelligence in Baghdad at the and the official responsible for Baghdad in the national security adviser's office were removed from their posts by al-Abadi. Five convicts were executed and 40 suspected jihadists were arrested following the attack.\n\nAccording to the Rudaw Media Network, the bombing was \"politically disastrous\" for the Iraqi government, which had presented the recapture of Fallujah as a step that would make Baghdad less vulnerable to such attacks, as Abadi said that the attacks originated in Fallujah. Seeing that Baghdad was still vulnerable to such attacks, the population of the city could, according to Rudaw, be less supportive of diverting manpower to liberating Mosul.\n\n====Religious====\nIraq's leading Sunni religious organisation, the Association of Muslim Scholars, called the bombing a \"bloody crime, regardless of who carried it out or what their motivations were\". A representative of Iraq's top Shia cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Ahmed al-Safi, paid a visit to the site of the bombings. Christians also held commemorations.\n\n====Other====\nOn social media, some Iraqis expressed anger at the ADE 651 fake bomb detector, which Abadi announced would be withdrawn from checkpoints. Users also question the silence of Saudis in light of the role of volunteer forces fighting ISIL and others in Iraq. Reuters has also reported that Iraqis are calling for increased crackdowns on so-called sleeper cells. Thousand of Iraqis gathered at the site of the bombing on 6 July to mourn the victims and express solidarity with their families.\n\n===International===\nAbdul Kareem Khalaf, an advisor to the European Centre for Counter-terrorism and Intelligence Studies think tank, recommended that Abadi \"have a meeting with the heads of national security, intelligence, the interior ministry and all sides responsible for security and ask them just one question: How can we infiltrate these groups?\"\n\nOn 6 July, New Zealand's Sky Tower in Auckland was lit up in the red, white, and black colors of the Iraqi flag to honour the victims of the attack. This initiative came at the urging of an Iraqi-New Zealander named Rania Alani who had called on the Sky Tower management to honour the victims of all attacks equally. Alani pointed out that Sky Tower had lit up in the colours of the French and American flags to honour the victims of attacks like the November 2015 Paris attacks and the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting. In addition, the Auckland Iraqi community held a candlelit vigil at the Mission Bay fountain in a show of solidarity with the Baghdad bombing victims. In Iran's Tehran, similar lights were draped on the Milad Tower in solidarity with Iraqis, and a candlelit vigil was also held outside the Iraqi embassy. The British flag at the U.K. Embassy in Baghdad was lowered to half mast. Further, an unnamed Spanish and Netherlands monument was also list in the colours of the flag. In an unknown place in Sweden, commemorations were also held with at least one police car having been dressed in the colours of the Iraqi flag. In Kuwait, an unnamed tower was lit in the colours of the Iraqi flag.\n\n==See also==\n* List of Islamist terrorist attacks\n* List of terrorist incidents, July\u2013December 2016\n* Terrorist incidents in Iraq in 2016\n* Muhammad ibn Ali al-Hadi Mausoleum attack\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n*","urls":["https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/death-toll-baghdad-blast-rises-292-minister-140018485.html","https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2017\/01\/12\/world\/iraq-terrorism-faceless-victims\/index.html","http:\/\/bigstory.ap.org\/article\/f1c1cbb0a62e4074abd08912bb12770b\/suicide-car-bombing-kills-least-8-people-baghdad","http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/news\/international\/is-claims-deadly-baghdad-shopping-street-bombing\/article8803797.ece","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/07\/04\/world\/middleeast\/baghdad-bombings.html?_r=0","http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2016\/05\/22\/world\/isis-more-attacks-ramadan\/index.html","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-middle-east-36910935","http:\/\/www.timesofisrael.com\/death-toll-from-islamic-state-attack-in-baghdad-rises-to-292\/","https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/more-200-dead-claimed-baghdad-blast-officials-072248788.html","http:\/\/www.ctvnews.ca\/world\/isis-car-bomb-kills-more-than-100-in-baghdad-1.2970767","http:\/\/www.the-star.co.ke\/news\/2016\/07\/04\/baghdad-suicide-bomb-attack-death-toll-rises-to-165-225-injured_c1380263","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-blast-idUSKCN0ZJ017","https:\/\/theintercept.com\/2015\/11\/23\/this-fake-bomb-detector-is-blamed-for-hundreds-of-deaths-its-still-in-use\/","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-toll-idUSKCN10B0VK?il=0","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-36696568","http:\/\/www.iraqinews.com\/iraq-war\/bomb-explosion-in-western-baghdad-one-al-hashd-al-shaabi-member-killed\/","http:\/\/www.iraqinews.com\/iraq-war\/car-bomb-blast-kills-civilian-al-latifiya-southern-baghdad\/","http:\/\/www.iraqinews.com\/iraq-war\/baghdad-bombing-casualties-in-karrada-rise-to-347\/","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2016\/jul\/03\/baghdad-bombings-dozens-killed","http:\/\/www.iraqinews.com\/iraq-war\/baghdad-bombing-scores-of-people-dead-dozens-injured\/","http:\/\/www.iraqinews.com\/iraq-war\/baghdad-bombing-isis-claims-responsibility-suicide-bombers-identity-revealed","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-blast-idUSKCN0ZJ017","http:\/\/international.sindonews.com\/read\/1121785\/43\/bom-baghdad-tewaskan-120-orang-irak-umumkan-berkabung-nasional-1467614071","http:\/\/www.iraqinews.com\/iraq-war\/baghdad-bombing-abadi-announces-three-day-mourning-for-karrada-victims\/","http:\/\/www.presstv.com\/Detail\/2016\/07\/06\/473889\/Iraq-resignation-Abadi-Ghabban","http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2016\/07\/iraqi-minister-submits-resignation-baghdad-bombing-160705132556099.html","http:\/\/www.al-monitor.com\/pulse\/sites\/almonitor\/contents\/afp\/2016\/07\/iraq-bombing-baghdad-security.html","http:\/\/rudaw.net\/english\/middleeast\/iraq\/070720165","http:\/\/www.presstv.com\/Detail\/2016\/07\/06\/473850\/Baghdad-Karradah-Iran-Spain-Netherlands-Kuwait","http:\/\/www.chicagotribune.com\/news\/nationworld\/ct-iraq-bombings-20160703-story.html","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-blast-idUSKCN0ZJ017","http:\/\/www.al-monitor.com\/pulse\/afp\/2016\/07\/iraq-conflict-bombing-mourning.html","http:\/\/www.newshub.co.nz\/nznews\/sky-tower-to-honour-iraqi-dead-2016070613","http:\/\/www.nzherald.co.nz\/nz\/news\/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11669655"]}

Lieutenant General Abdulamir al-Shimmari, the head of Baghdad Operations Command, along with the Interior Ministry head of intelligence in Baghdad at the and the official responsible for Baghdad in the national security adviser's office were removed from their posts by al-Abadi. Five convicts were executed and 40 suspected jihadists were arrested following the attack.\n\nAccording to the Rudaw Media Network, the bombing was \"politically disastrous\" for the Iraqi government, which had presented the recapture of Fallujah as a step that would make Baghdad less vulnerable to such attacks, as Abadi said that the attacks originated in Fallujah. Seeing that Baghdad was still vulnerable to such attacks, the population of the city could, according to Rudaw, be less supportive of diverting manpower to liberating Mosul.\n\n====Religious====\nIraq's leading Sunni religious organisation, the Association of Muslim Scholars, called the bombing a \"bloody crime, regardless of who carried it out or what their motivations were\". A representative of Iraq's top Shia cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Ahmed al-Safi, paid a visit to the site of the bombings. Christians also held commemorations.\n\n====Other====\nOn social media, some Iraqis expressed anger at the ADE 651 fake bomb detector, which Abadi announced would be withdrawn from checkpoints. Users also question the silence of Saudis in light of the role of volunteer forces fighting ISIL and others in Iraq. Reuters has also reported that Iraqis are calling for increased crackdowns on so-called sleeper cells. Thousand of Iraqis gathered at the site of the bombing on 6 July to mourn the victims and express solidarity with their families.\n\n===International===\nAbdul Kareem Khalaf, an advisor to the European Centre for Counter-terrorism and Intelligence Studies think tank, recommended that Abadi \"have a meeting with the heads of national security, intelligence, the interior ministry and all sides responsible for security and ask them just one question: How can we infiltrate these groups?\"\n\nOn 6 July, New Zealand's Sky Tower in Auckland was lit up in the red, white, and black colors of the Iraqi flag to honour the victims of the attack. This initiative came at the urging of an Iraqi-New Zealander named Rania Alani who had called on the Sky Tower management to honour the victims of all attacks equally. Alani pointed out that Sky Tower had lit up in the colours of the French and American flags to honour the victims of attacks like the November 2015 Paris attacks and the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting. In addition, the Auckland Iraqi community held a candlelit vigil at the Mission Bay fountain in a show of solidarity with the Baghdad bombing victims. In Iran's Tehran, similar lights were draped on the Milad Tower in solidarity with Iraqis, and a candlelit vigil was also held outside the Iraqi embassy. The British flag at the U.K. Embassy in Baghdad was lowered to half mast. Further, an unnamed Spanish and Netherlands monument was also list in the colours of the flag. In an unknown place in Sweden, commemorations were also held with at least one police car having been dressed in the colours of the Iraqi flag. In Kuwait, an unnamed tower was lit in the colours of the Iraqi flag.\n\n==See also==\n* List of Islamist terrorist attacks\n* List of terrorist incidents, July\u2013December 2016\n* Terrorist incidents in Iraq in 2016\n* Muhammad ibn Ali al-Hadi Mausoleum attack\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n*","urls":["https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/death-toll-baghdad-blast-rises-292-minister-140018485.html","https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2017\/01\/12\/world\/iraq-terrorism-faceless-victims\/index.html","http:\/\/bigstory.ap.org\/article\/f1c1cbb0a62e4074abd08912bb12770b\/suicide-car-bombing-kills-least-8-people-baghdad","http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/news\/international\/is-claims-deadly-baghdad-shopping-street-bombing\/article8803797.ece","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/07\/04\/world\/middleeast\/baghdad-bombings.html?_r=0","http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2016\/05\/22\/world\/isis-more-attacks-ramadan\/index.html","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-middle-east-36910935","http:\/\/www.timesofisrael.com\/death-toll-from-islamic-state-attack-in-baghdad-rises-to-292\/","https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/more-200-dead-claimed-baghdad-blast-officials-072248788.html","http:\/\/www.ctvnews.ca\/world\/isis-car-bomb-kills-more-than-100-in-baghdad-1.2970767","http:\/\/www.the-star.co.ke\/news\/2016\/07\/04\/baghdad-suicide-bomb-attack-death-toll-rises-to-165-225-injured_c1380263","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-blast-idUSKCN0ZJ017","https:\/\/theintercept.com\/2015\/11\/23\/this-fake-bomb-detector-is-blamed-for-hundreds-of-deaths-its-still-in-use\/","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-toll-idUSKCN10B0VK?il=0","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-36696568","http:\/\/www.iraqinews.com\/iraq-war\/bomb-explosion-in-western-baghdad-one-al-hashd-al-shaabi-member-killed\/","http:\/\/www.iraqinews.com\/iraq-war\/car-bomb-blast-kills-civilian-al-latifiya-southern-baghdad\/","http:\/\/www.iraqinews.com\/iraq-war\/baghdad-bombing-casualties-in-karrada-rise-to-347\/","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2016\/jul\/03\/baghdad-bombings-dozens-killed","http:\/\/www.iraqinews.com\/iraq-war\/baghdad-bombing-scores-of-people-dead-dozens-injured\/","http:\/\/www.iraqinews.com\/iraq-war\/baghdad-bombing-isis-claims-responsibility-suicide-bombers-identity-revealed","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-blast-idUSKCN0ZJ017","http:\/\/international.sindonews.com\/read\/1121785\/43\/bom-baghdad-tewaskan-120-orang-irak-umumkan-berkabung-nasional-1467614071","http:\/\/www.iraqinews.com\/iraq-war\/baghdad-bombing-abadi-announces-three-day-mourning-for-karrada-victims\/","http:\/\/www.presstv.com\/Detail\/2016\/07\/06\/473889\/Iraq-resignation-Abadi-Ghabban","http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2016\/07\/iraqi-minister-submits-resignation-baghdad-bombing-160705132556099.html","http:\/\/www.al-monitor.com\/pulse\/sites\/almonitor\/contents\/afp\/2016\/07\/iraq-bombing-baghdad-security.html","http:\/\/rudaw.net\/english\/middleeast\/iraq\/070720165","http:\/\/www.presstv.com\/Detail\/2016\/07\/06\/473850\/Baghdad-Karradah-Iran-Spain-Netherlands-Kuwait","http:\/\/www.chicagotribune.com\/news\/nationworld\/ct-iraq-bombings-20160703-story.html","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-blast-idUSKCN0ZJ017","http:\/\/www.al-monitor.com\/pulse\/afp\/2016\/07\/iraq-conflict-bombing-mourning.html","http:\/\/www.newshub.co.nz\/nznews\/sky-tower-to-honour-iraqi-dead-2016070613","http:\/\/www.nzherald.co.nz\/nz\/news\/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11669655"]}

{"title":"23 July 2012 Iraq attacks","article":"The 23 July 2012 Iraq attacks were a series of simultaneous, coordinated bombings and shootings that struck the Iraqi security force and Shi'ite Muslim communities. At least 116 people were killed and 299 wounded in the attacks, making them the deadliest attacks in the country since May 2010. The Islamic State of Iraq claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\n== Background ==\nThe attacks occurred about seven months following the withdrawal of the United States military forces from the area, leaving the security of the country in the hands of the Iraqi security forces.\n\n== Attacks ==\nNumerous attacks were conducted within hours of each other on 23 July 2012 across thirteen different cities in Iraq. Naharnet reported the number of towns and cities attacked as eighteen. The number of attacks, on the other hand, was given to be thirty. Two more attacks occurred late on 23 July 2012, increasing the number of attacks to thirty-two. Rod Nordland stated that the number of attacks was forty. The major targets of the attacks were security forces, government buildings and Shia Muslim neighbourhoods.\n\nThe first attack took place on an army base in Saladin Governorate around dawn. In Taji, nearly  north of Baghdad, a series of bombs around a number of homes went off simultaneously; as police arrived and residents began searching the wreckage for survivors, a suicide bomber detonated himself, killing more. At least 41 people were killed in this attack, considered the worst of the overall event. A car bomb exploded near a government building in Sadr City in Baghdad, killing 16. At least five car bombs went off in Kirkuk. The insurgents attacked a base in Dhuluiya, killing 15 soldiers. In al-Husseiniya, a predominantly Shiite suburb in northeastern Baghdad and in Mosul, a total of six people were killed in bombing attacks. Explosion in Yarmouk, another neighborhood of Baghdad, killed at least four people and injured another 24. Nearly five people were also killed and 22 or 25 injured when a car bomb exploded near a busy market in Diwaniya. Of all the sites attacked, only Diwaniya is an undisputed Shiite territory. There were checkpoint shootings and bomb blasts in the ethnically mixed Diyala Governorate, resulting in 11 dead and 40 wounded. In the western city of Heet, a car bombing occurred near an army patrol, killing one soldier and injuring 10 others. The other towns and cities suffered from bombings were Saadiya, Khan Beni-Saad, Tuz Khurmatu, Dibis, Samarra and Dujail.\n\nIn addition to all these attacks took place daytime, there were two more attacks late in the day. One of these attacks was a car bomb blast near a caf\u00e9 in the Shi'ite Ameen district in southeastern Baghdad, killing six men and wounding 24. The second was a roadside bombing near Baquba, a city northeast of Baghdad. The second blast killed three people and injured seven others.\n\n== Perpetrators ==\nThough no group claimed responsibility immediately after the killings, the attacks were believed by Iraqi officials, media and specialists to be orchestrated by Al Qaeda, seeking to gain control of the country following the departure of the American forces. An announcement purported to be from Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the current leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq known as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), had been broadcast on 21 July 2012; in the announcement, al-Baghdadi declared the intention towards a new offensive to retake the country, a move claimed to be supported by the Sunni population of Iraq. Previous attacks that have targeted the security forces have been attributed to al-Qaeda.\n\nOn 25 July 2012, the Islamic State of Iraq posted a statement on radical Islamist websites, indicating that it was responsible for the recent attacks, calling the attacks \"Destroying the Walls\" campaign. ISI also stated that it was just the start of a \"new stage of jihad\".\n\n== Reactions ==\n=== Domestic ===\n*Iraq \u2013 An unnamed official for the current Iraqi government believed the attacks were made by the terrorist group al-Qaeda, as part of a larger scheme to ignite a \"bloody sectarian war\".\n\n=== International ===\n*Canada \u2013 Canada condemned the violence.\n*France \u2013 French president, Francois Hollande, condemned the attacks and stated that his country would stand by Iraq and fully support its efforts to enhance stability and security.\n*Iran \u2013 Tehran and the Iranian Foreign Ministry condemned the attack and expressed its full support to the Iraqi government.\n*Russia \u2013 The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed its condolences to victims' relatives and support for the Iraqi government's measures to \"stabilize the situation and boost security\" in the country.\n*Turkey \u2013 The Turkish Foreign Ministry condemned the bombings in Iraq and stated that it would maintain the solidarity with the people of Iraq in fighting terrorism. \n*United Nations \u2013 The United Nations mission in Iraq strongly condemned the attacks. \n*United States \u2013 US State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland condemned shootings and bomb attacks in Iraq.\n\n== References ==","urls":["https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2012\/07\/24\/us-iraq-violence-idUSBRE86N0AF20120724","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-18950706","http:\/\/www.businessweek.com\/ap\/2012-07-23\/iraqi-bombings-kill-28-north-of-baghdad","http:\/\/www.naharnet.com\/stories\/en\/47520-107-killed-in-iraq-s-deadliest-day-in-two-years","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2012\/jul\/23\/iraq-vacuum-terrorism-alqaida-islamists?newsfeed=true","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/07\/25\/world\/middleeast\/al-qaeda-insinuating-its-way-into-syrias-conflict.html?pagewanted=all","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2012\/jul\/23\/iraq-violence-dead","http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2012\/07\/23\/world\/meast\/iraq-unrest\/?hpt=hp_t2","http:\/\/news.sky.com\/story\/963781\/bloody-day-of-violence-in-iraq-kills-dozens","http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/8301-501713_162-57477389\/al-qaida-were-returning-to-old-iraq-strongholds\/","http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/news\/nationworld\/world\/la-iraq-deaths-0723,0,6679210.story","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2012\/07\/25\/us-iraq-violence-alqaeda-idUSBRE86O0AN20120725","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2012\/07\/23\/us-iraq-bomb-idUSBRE86M06M20120723","http:\/\/www.asiaone.com\/News\/Latest%2BNews\/World\/Story\/A1Story20120724-361035.html","http:\/\/www.kuna.net.kw\/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2254408&language=en","http:\/\/www.tehrantimes.com\/component\/content\/article\/99900","http:\/\/english.ruvr.ru\/2012_07_23\/Death-toll-of-Iraq-attacks-rises-to-107\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160404153326\/http:\/\/sputniknews.com\/voiceofrussia\/2012_07_23\/Death-toll-of-Iraq-attacks-rises-to-107\/","http:\/\/www.aa.com.tr\/en\/news\/67134--s","http:\/\/www.kuna.net.kw\/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2254324&Language=en","http:\/\/www.rferl.org\/content\/iraq-violence-washington-reaction\/24654407.html"]}
{"title":"13 June 2012 Iraq attacks","article":"The 13 June 2012 Iraq attacks were a series of simultaneous bombings and shootings that killed 93 people and wounded over 300 others. The attacks were carried out in seven different locations throughout Iraq.\n\n==Background==\nExtra security had been put in place to cope with the large crowds of pilgrims expected in Baghdad. Two days before the attacks, six people were killed and almost 40 injured in a mortar attack near the Moussa al-Kadhim shrine.\n\n== Attacks ==\nMost of the attacks were car bombings and appeared to be aimed primarily at Shi'ite pilgrims gathered to commemorate the death of imam Moussa al-Kadhim. The first car bomb, aimed at a group of pilgrims, exploded in Taji, a town north of Baghdad. It was followed by four blasts across Baghdad. According to an eyewitness, the bombs were aimed at pilgrims but also killed people working in the area. In all, ten blasts were reported across the Baghdad area.\n\nTwo bombs in Hilla appear to have been aimed at security forces. The perpetrators targeted a restaurant frequented by police, killing 22 people and leaving 38 wounded. According to eyewitness reports, the car bomb was detonated right as a minibus full of police officers pulled up to the restaurant. \"It's heart-breaking. It's just sirens, and screams of wounded people,\" remarked an eyewitness.\n\nIn Kirkuk three bombs exploded, with one targeting the headquarters of Kurdish President Massoud Barzani. A civilian was killed in that explosion. Two car bombs exploded near simultaneously in Balad, north of the capital, killing seven pilgrims and injuring 34 others. Bombings were also reported in Mosul and Karbala. Three federal policemen were shot dead by unidentified gunmen in the Baghdad's Saidyiah district.\n\n== Perpetrators ==\nThere were no immediate claims of responsibility for the bombings. However, reports suggested the participation of the Islamic State of Iraq, as the attacks mostly appeared to target Shi'ite pilgrims.\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n=== Domestic ===\nThe speaker for the Iraqi parliament Usama al-Nujayfi called the attacks a \"move to provoke sectarian strife\". Dhia al-Wakeel, the Baghdad military command spokesperson, said that while the attacks are intended to initiate clashes between sects, \"Iraqis are fully aware of the terrorism agenda and will not slip into a sectarian conflict\".\n\nAbdul-Sataar al-Jumaili, of the Sunni-majority political bloc Iraqiya, was quoted by journalists as saying that the \"violent acts reflect the depth of the political crisis in the country and the escalation of political differences among blocks\".\n\n=== International ===\n*United Nations \u2013 The head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI) and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's Special Representative for Iraq Martin Kobler expressed his shock at the attacks and appealed to the government \"to address the root causes of the violence and terrorism that are causing so much suffering and pain to the Iraqi people\". UNAMI released a statement, warning that the current political stalemate in the country is \"diverting attention from pressing economic, social and security issues\".\n*Russia \u2013 Russia's Foreign Ministry issued a statement condemning the attacks saying that \"Among their victims are peaceful civilians, including women and children\".\n*United Kingdom \u2013 The British Minister for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, said \"I was appalled to hear of the bombings across Iraq today which mainly targeted Shia pilgrims in Baghdad and elsewhere. I strongly condemn these cowardly attacks and offer my deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their lives and those who were injured. I urge all political blocs in Iraq to work together and focus on bringing security and stability to all of Iraq.\"\n*United States \u2013 The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad issued a statement condemning the attacks and that \"the perpetrators of these cowardly terrorist attacks must be brought to justice and we will support Iraq's Security Forces in this effort in any way we can.\"\n\n== References ==","urls":["https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-18420488","http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/middleeast\/2012\/06\/20126135517423300.html","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2012\/06\/14\/world\/meast\/iraq-violence\/index.html","http:\/\/www.theepochtimes.com\/n2\/world\/dozens-dead-in-multiple-iraq-bombings-251505.html","http:\/\/www.scoop.co.nz\/stories\/WO1206\/S00358\/calls-to-address-root-causes-of-violence-in-iraq.htm","http:\/\/english.ruvr.ru\/2012_06_14\/78153569\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20120721033204\/http:\/\/english.ruvr.ru\/2012_06_14\/78153569\/","https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/news\/foreign-office-minister-condemns-bomb-attacks-in-iraq"]}

{"title":"10 May 2012 Damascus bombings","article":"The 10 May 2012 Damascus bombings were carried out using a pair of car bombs allegedly detonated by suicide bombers outside a military intelligence complex in Damascus, Syria. Combined, the perpetrators detonated more than  of explosives, tearing the facade off a 10-story building. With 55 people confirmed dead and almost 400 others injured, the attack was the deadliest bombing to its date in the Syrian Civil War, though later outpaced by other events.\n\n==Bombing==\nThe initial car bomb was detonated on a six-lane highway in the neighbourhood of Qazzaz adjacent to a military intelligence compound during the morning rush hour. The detonation destroyed the compound's security wall.  As a crowd gathered around the site of the blast, a second, larger explosion quickly followed.\n\n==Responsibility==\nThe Syrian Interior Ministry said \"foreign-backed terrorists\" were responsible for the incident.\n\nOpposition groups accused the Syrian government of staging the bombings to discredit the resistance to Bashar al-Assad's government. These claims were received with skepticism by some journalists and Middle East analysts who deemed it unlikely that the government would attack their own intelligence headquarters.\n\nBill Roggio, an analyst on terror and military issues, stated the attacks were \"very likely\" carried out by the al-Qaeda-linked opposition group Al-Nusra Front to Protect the Levant. This possibility was also visited upon by counter-terrorism expert Ghaffar Hussain who researched possible al-Qaeda involvement in the overall Syrian uprising.\n\nIndeed, a man purporting to represent the Al-Nusra Front claimed responsibility for the attacks in a video released the following day. However, four days later, someone claiming to be a spokesman for the group denied that the organization was responsible for the attack, saying the video that was previously provided is a fake, and that any information regarding their operations would be announced through jihadi forums.\n\nOn 18 May, UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon stated that he believed al-Qaeda was behind the attack by saying: \"Very alarmingly and surprisingly, a few days ago, there was a huge serious massive terrorist attack. I believe that there must be Al-Qaeda behind it. This has created again very serious problems\".\n\nThe Guardian interviewed rebel defectors who worked at the Palestinian branch, where the bombing took place. The defectors also believed the government was responsible for the bombing. One of them is quoted as saying \"Three days before the bomb the Alawite officers started disappearing and so too did all of the important prisoners ... The cameras were also taken down and the important files were removed. The only people left in the building when the explosion happened were Sunni officers and guards or some prisoners.\"\n\nOn 30 September Saudi state-owned Al Arabiya news claimed to have proof that the government were behind the attacks. They cited \"classified government documents that had been acquired through the Syrian opposition\". The documents allegedly indicate the purpose of the attack was to discredit the opposition and convince the international community that terrorists were active in the country. According to the Al Arabiya, Maj. Gen. Dhu al-Himma Shalish, head of presidential security, ordered Colonel Suhail Hassan of the Air Force Intelligence Directorate to carry out the bombing citing direct orders from the president. Al Arabiya has been determined to be an unreliable source with an agenda.\n\n==See also==\n* List of bombings during the Syrian civil war\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2012\/may\/10\/syria-worst-terror-attack-uprising?newsfeed=true","https:\/\/www.google.com\/hostednews\/afp\/article\/ALeqM5jIlGiHp2Q3C-tgAHiaEQNtuPMzOQ?docId=CNG.2aac56872c3060f25517260a8c37baca.131","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-18030110","https:\/\/www.theglobeandmail.com\/news\/world\/charred-or-dismembered-bodies-scattered-as-blasts-rock-damascus\/article2428371\/","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/middle-east-live\/2012\/may\/10\/syria-damascus-explosions-live","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2012\/05\/10\/world\/meast\/syria-unrest\/index.html","http:\/\/m.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-18048033","http:\/\/www.thecommentator.com\/article\/1208\/now_al_qaeda_joins_the_fight_against_assad_in_syria","http:\/\/www.itv.com\/news\/update\/2012-05-12\/jihadist-group-claim-responsibility-for-deadly-damascus-attack\/","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-18070085","http:\/\/dawn.com\/2012\/05\/15\/jihadist-group-denies-claiming-damascus-bombings\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20120719030341\/http:\/\/dawn.com\/2012\/05\/15\/jihadist-group-denies-claiming-damascus-bombings\/","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-18115084","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2012\/may\/18\/syrian-military-defectors-damascus-blasts?CMP=twt_gu","http:\/\/english.alarabiya.net\/articles\/2012\/09\/30\/241008.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20121001052725\/http:\/\/english.alarabiya.net\/articles\/2012\/09\/30\/241008.html"]}

At least 38 people were reported dead. Suspicion fell on Boko Haram, the radical Islamist sect blamed for hundreds of killings in the country in 2012 alone.\n\n==Details==\nThe blast struck Kaduna, the capital of Kaduna state, leaving charred motorcycles and debris strewn across a major road in the city where many gather to eat at informal restaurants and buy black market gasoline. Nearby hotels and homes had their windows blown out and roofs torn away by the force of the powerful explosion, which engulfed a group of motorcycle taxi-men.\n\nThe explosion damaged the nearby All Nations Christian Assemblies International Church and the ECWA Good News Church as churchgoers worshiped at an Easter service, the explosive-laden car attempted to go into the compound of the churches before it detonated, but was blocked by barriers in the street and was turned away by a security guard as police approached.\n\n\"We were in the holy communion service and I was exhorting my people and all of a sudden, we heard a loud noise that shattered all our windows and doors, destroyed our fans and some of our equipment in the church,\" Pastor Joshua Raji said.\n\n==Responsibility==\nWhile no one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, suspicion immediately fell on a radical Islamist sect blamed for hundreds of killings in the oil-rich country this year alone.

About 20 minutes later, a second bomb planted in a motorcycle exploded as rescuers convened at the site of the original bombing. Later, a third explosion from a device placed in a car set fire to nearby buildings. About 11 people were killed and 110 wounded by the blasts, with the second explosion causing a majority of casualties.\n\n=== Hat Yai ===\nFollowing the bombings in Songkhla, an explosion in the basement Lee Gardens Plaza Hotel damaged that building and an adjacent McDonald's in Hat Yai, killing at least four and leaving 416 wounded, mainly from smoke inhalation. It was first reported to be the cause of a gas leak but later was attributed to a car bomb. The bombing was regarded by some sources as an escalation in the insurgency because its target was a hotel popular with tourists from Malaysia and Singapore.\n\n== Suspects ==\nThe attacks have been regarded by most major news outlets as part of the broader South Thailand insurgency. While no terrorist organisation took responsibility for the bombings, the most likely culprit is the Gerakan Mujahidin Islam Patani (GMIP) separatist movement, which is a splinter group of the Gerakan Mujahidin Pattani.\n\nAccording to security sources, Sahudin Tohjehmae was suspected to carry out the three bomb attacks with the help of Saifulloh Sahfru, a terrorist suspect who is a friend of Faisol Hayisama-ae, who was suspected of carrying out the bomb attack at Hat Yai International Airport in 2005.\n\n==References==\n\n\n== See also ==\n* South Thailand insurgency","urls":["http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/World\/Asia-Pacific\/2012\/0401\/Muslim-militants-in-south-Thailand-growing-stronger<\/ref>","https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB10001424052702303404704577315431732228016","http:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/world-news\/RestOfAsia\/Car-bombs-kill-13-in-southern-Thailand\/Article1-833759.aspx","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20120401213029\/http:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/world-news\/RestOfAsia\/Car-bombs-kill-13-in-southern-Thailand\/Article1-833759.aspx"]}

{"title":"2012 Khyber Agency bombing","article":"The 2012 Khyber Agency bombing occurred on 10 January 2012, when a bomb exploded near a petrol pump in the town of Jamrud near the Afghan border in Khyber Agency of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of Pakistan. The bombing killed at least 30 people while 78 others were injured.\n\n==Background==\nThe Khyber Agency market bombing was recorded to be the first major terrorist attack in the country since September 2011 when a Taliban suicide bomber had  killed 46 people at a funeral in Lower Dir, targeting anti-Taliban militia members. Khyber Agency has experienced heavy conflict due to constant cross-border movement of militants connected to the War in Afghanistan. It used to serve as the main NATO supply route to Afghanistan until the closure of all supply lines by Pakistan in the wake of a NATO-led attack on Pakistani military checkposts which resulted in the death of 24 Pakistani soldiers.\n\n==Attack==\nAccording to official sources, the bomb was triggered by a remote-controlled device and had been planted beforehand in a passenger pick-up van at a fuel station in the town near a vegetable market (bazaar). A local government administrator said the incident may have been a reaction to a successful military operation underway in Khyber Agency against insurgents and that the possible target of the attack may have been people of the Zakhakhel tribe who had formed a lashkar (armed militia) against Tehrik-i-Taliban militants. The bombing had hallmarks similar to earlier attacks carried out by insurgent groups.\n\nThe injured were transported by ambulances to the Hayatabad Medical Complex, Khyber Teaching Hospital and Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar. The area was closed and cordoned by security agencies for investigation following the explosion. Funeral prayers were held for the dead soon after the attack. A compensation of Rs. 1,00,000 was announced by authorities for heirs of the deceased victims and Rs. 25,000 for those who were injured.\n\n==Responsibility==\nA Taliban spokesman speaking via telephone from an undisclosed location denied that the Taliban had a role in the attack. Taliban spokesperson Ehsanullah Ehsan also disowned the attack in an email sent to the media. Local residents claimed that the nature of the bombing suggested that it was related more to a tribal dispute, since most of the victims of the blast were members of a tribe who opposed the notorious local warlord Mangal Bagh.\n\n==Reactions==\n===Domestic===\n* President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani condemned the blast and expressed grief over the loss of lives.\n* Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Amir Haider Khan Hoti condemned the incident while Masood Kausar, the Governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, also condemned the blast and called it an inhuman act in which innocent people were targeted.

{"title":"2011 Damascus bombings","article":"On 23 December 2011, two seemingly coordinated bombings occurred in the Syrian capital of Damascus. The alleged suicide car bombs exploded outside Syrian military intelligence agency buildings, killing 44 people and injuring 166. According to Syrian state media, most of the dead were civilians. The attacks took place during the Syrian uprising. The Syrian government blamed Islamist militants, while the Syrian opposition accused the government of staging the attacks to justify its crackdown on the uprising.\n\n== Background ==\n\nOn the same day as the attacks, an Arab League team of observers arrived in Syria to monitor the government's activities and push towards a solution of the nine-month uprising against the government. Officials from the visiting team later visited the sites of both explosions. Government officials escorted the team to the scene of the explosions and re-iterated their longtime claims that the uprising is not a popular one but the work of terrorists.\n\n== Bombings ==\nThe bombings were in the Kfar Sousa neighbourhood, south-west of Damascus city center. The state-owned news channel, al-Ikhbariya al-Suriya, said the first car bomb exploded outside the offices of an unspecified security agency. When guards at a nearby General Security Directorate compound went to inspect the first blast, the driver of another vehicle rammed the main gates and detonated the bomb it was carrying. According to a Syrian journalist who lives in Kfar Sousa, gunfire was heard immediately following the blasts and windows up to 200\u00a0m (670\u00a0ft) away were shattered.\n\nThe bombings killed 44 people and injured 166. Syrian state media reported that most of the casualties were civilians.\n\n== Perpetrators ==\n===Al-Qaeda===\nImmediately, the Syrian government claimed that al-Qaeda was behind these attacks. That Syrian claim was dismissed within a day by Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird as propaganda. Also the Syrian National Council dismissed it, as Syrian attempt to stoke Western fears for Islamist and extremist elements in the Syrian uprising.\n\n====Jabhat al-Nusra====\nIn January 2013, commentator Jamie Dettmer for website The Daily Beast stated that the Al-Nusra Front perpetrated the attack, and that the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center assumed it to be carried out by two female suicide bombers from Iraq.\n\n===Syrian government===\nSyrian opposition leaders accused the government of staging the attacks to justify its crackdown on the uprising. Also former Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri claimed the bombings were \"engineered\" by the Syrian government. The Free Syrian Army (FSA), the main anti-regime paramilitary group, accused the government of perpetrating the attack to gain sympathy from the Arab League and its observers, who had arrived just before the bombings. \nThe Syrian National Council said \"the Syrian regime, alone, bears all the direct responsibility for the two terrorist explosions\", adding that the government wanted to create the impression \"that it faces danger coming from abroad and not a popular revolution demanding freedom and dignity\".\n\nThe Abdullah Azzam Brigades, an affiliate of al Qaeda in Iraq that operates throughout the Middle East, on 28 December 2011 denied all involvement in the suicide attacks, and called the regime's blame on al-Qaeda an attempt to deflect attention from its own brutal crackdown on protesters: \"The only truly responsible for them is he who is benefiting from them (\u2026) the regime of al Assad and his intelligence agencies\".\n\n====Syrian intelligence====\nMohammed Tayfour \u2013 the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood's 'Deputy Guide'\u2014told Al Arabiya television that Syrian intelligence created a fake MB website and published a fake statement. He also said that, according to sources close to the Brotherhood, Syrian intelligence was behind the bombings.\n\n==See also==\n* List of bombings during the Syrian civil war\n\n== References ==","urls":["http:\/\/www.trust.org\/alertnet\/news\/arab-league-team-visit-damascus-blast-sites-tv\/","https:\/\/archive.is\/20120912213456\/http:\/\/www.trust.org\/alertnet\/news\/arab-league-team-visit-damascus-blast-sites-tv\/","http:\/\/www.salon.com\/2011\/12\/23\/syria_twin_suicide_bombs_shake_capital_30_dead\/singleton\/","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-16324598","https:\/\/www.google.com\/hostednews\/afp\/article\/ALeqM5hzM-4-XNZQ_rqF_6vYGvRvwLI5lg?docId=CNG.a00b16d99e65fef7697dda52553d56c2.271","http:\/\/www.trust.org\/alertnet\/news\/forty-killed-100-wounded-in-damascus-blasts--tv\/","https:\/\/archive.is\/20130416003457\/http:\/\/www.trust.org\/alertnet\/news\/forty-killed-100-wounded-in-damascus-blasts--tv\/","http:\/\/www2.canada.com\/vancouversun\/news\/archives\/story.html?id=24b81365-2b0b-471f-9242-419ca99e19fd","https:\/\/archive.today\/20120919185735\/http:\/\/www2.canada.com\/vancouversun\/news\/archives\/story.html?id=24b81365-2b0b-471f-9242-419ca99e19fd","http:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/articles\/2013\/01\/04\/jihadists-are-creeping-into-syria-s-rebel-factions.html","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-16313879","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/middle-east-live\/2011\/dec\/23\/syria-egypt-yemen-protests-live-updates?newsfeed=true","https:\/\/wayback.archive-it.org\/all\/20111227123916\/http:\/\/www.nowlebanon.com\/NewsArchiveDetails.aspx?ID=346093","http:\/\/www.longwarjournal.org\/archives\/2011\/12\/adbullah_azzam_briga.php","https:\/\/www.webcitation.org\/65kMlpLvT?url=http:\/\/www.longwarjournal.org\/archives\/2011\/12\/adbullah_azzam_briga.php","http:\/\/english.alarabiya.net\/articles\/2011\/12\/24\/184312.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20111225042710\/http:\/\/english.alarabiya.net\/articles\/2011\/12\/24\/184312.html","http:\/\/www.nowlebanon.com\/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?ID=346074","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20111227095503\/http:\/\/www.nowlebanon.com\/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?ID=346074","http:\/\/english.ahram.org.eg\/NewsContent\/2\/8\/30107\/World\/Region\/Breaking-Syrian-Muslim-Brotherhood-claim-of-carryi.aspx"]}
{"title":"22 December 2011 Baghdad bombings","article":"On 22 December 2011, a series of coordinated attacks occurred in Baghdad, Iraq, killing 69 people. This was the first major attack following U.S. withdrawal from Iraq.\n\n== Attacks ==\nIraqi officials reported at least 14 bombs went off in the capital, targeting a total of 11 neighborhoods. The Iraqi health ministry estimated 69 deaths and at least 169 wounded. The majority of attacks occurred in Shiite areas, with the exception of an IED attack in the Sunni enclave of Adhamiyah. The worst attack, the only confirmed suicide bombing, took place in the Karrada district where a bomber drove an ambulance into a government anti-corruption office, killing 25 and injuring 62. Local policemen who were standing guard let the ambulance driver through because of the vehicle and his assurances that he was trying to reach a nearby hospital.\n\nThe attacks were the first assault on the capital after the beginning of an apparent sectarian crisis in the government, with prime minister Nouri al-Maliki issuing an arrest warrant for vice president Tariq Al-Hashimi just days before the incidents.  Journalists on the ground reported that security forces were blocking access to bombing sites and that the usually packed Baghdad streets were almost deserted in the aftermath of the bombings.\n\nIn addition to the attacks in the capital, several other attacks took place around the country, including gunmen killing a family of five and a local bodyguard in the city of Baqubah. Two of the family members were members of a Sunni Awakening council. Several shootings took place in the city of Mosul, leaving two dead and four injured. Other attacks left five people injured in Musayyib and Jurf Al-Sakhar south of the capital, and a body was found in Kirkuk.\n\nLater in the evening several explosions rocked Baghdad once more. Local journalists reported at least 4 more blasts happening around 10 o'clock local time. The official death toll was raised to 72 after these further bombings, which included attacks in the Al-Shurtta and Al-Jihad districts in southwestern Baghdad.\n\n== Investigations ==\n\n=== Speculations ===\nThere were no immediate claims of responsibility for the bombings. However, reports suggested the participation of al Qaeda's Sunni insurgents, as the attack mostly appeared to hit Shiite neighborhoods. Vice-President al-Hashimi, while in hiding in Iraqi Kurdistan, accused elements in the Iraqi government of orchestrating the attacks.\n\nThe Islamic State of Iraq, al Qaeda's political front, claimed the 22 Dec. Baghdad bombings in a statement released on jihadist Internet forums. The statement was translated by the SITE Intelligence Group. The claim was made on 26 December 2011; the day after another suicide attack killed seven policemen outside the Interior Ministry.\n\n== Claim of liability ==\nThe Islamic State of Iraq said the attacks were the latest in what they described as a \"series of special invasions ... to support the weak Sunnis in the prisons of the apostates and to retaliate for the captives who were executed by the Safavid [Persian or Iranian] government.\"\n\nThe term \"Safavid government\" refers to the government of Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki, a Shia politician who is accused by the Islamic State of Iraq of being under Iran's sphere of influence. Maliki has cracked down on Sunni politicians, and immediately after the US withdrawal of its troops this month, issued an arrest warrant for Vice President Tariq Hashemi. The move plunged Iraq into political crisis.\n\nIslamic State of Iraq said the targets in the 22 Dec. attack in Baghdad had been \"accurately surveyed and explored,\" and the \"operations were distributed between targeting security headquarters, military patrols and gatherings of the filthy ones of the al-Dajjal Army [Shia warlord Muqtada al Sadr's Mahdi Army].\" The terror group said it \"knows where and when to strike, and the mujahideen will never stand with their hands tied while the pernicious Iranian project showed its ugly face and what it wants with Sunnis in Iraq became obvious and exposed.\" The Islamic State of Iraq briefly described the suicide attack that targeted a security headquarters in Karrada in Baghdad, and said that details of the other attacks that day would be \"published later on.\"\n\n== Reaction ==\nAyad Allawi, leader of Iraqiya party, blamed the government for the violence. Allawi warned that \"violence would continue as long as people are left out of the political process.\"\n\nU.S military officials have expressed concern about the \"resurgence of al-Qaeda\" as the American military left the country.\n\n== See also ==\n\n*List of bombings during the Iraqi insurgency (2011\u20132013)\n\n== References ==","urls":["https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/news\/world\/iraq\/story\/2011-12-22\/Baghdad-Iraq-bombings\/52152872\/1","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-iraq-violence-idUSTRE7BL0AN20111222","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2011\/dec\/22\/baghdad-bomb-attacks-iraq","https:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=144287818","https:\/\/twitter.com\/arwaCNN\/status\/149780224287051776<\/ref>","https:\/\/twitter.com\/JomanaCNN\/status\/149780285158989825<\/ref>","http:\/\/news.trust.org\/item\/20111222180700-df2gz","https:\/\/twitter.com\/mtawfeeqCNN\/status\/149923919418245120<\/ref>","http:\/\/www.voanews.com\/english\/news\/Blasts-Kill-Dozens-in-Iraq-as-Political-Crisis-Continues-136054818.html","http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/8301-202_162-57346927\/string-of-baghdad-attacks-kills-at-least-69\/","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-16325282","http:\/\/www.longwarjournal.org\/archives\/2011\/12\/al_qaeda_in_iraq_cla_1.php","https:\/\/www.webcitation.org\/64IUw7ek0?url=http:\/\/www.longwarjournal.org\/archives\/2011\/12\/al_qaeda_in_iraq_cla_1.php","http:\/\/www.toledoblade.com\/World\/2011\/12\/22\/Wave-of-bombings-across-Iraqi-capital-kills-60.html"]}

The first attacks took place on the 7 October when a magnetic bomb and two IED blasts killed 7 and injured 39 in the north and south districts of Baghdad. On the 10 October three explosions hit the mainly Shia neighborhood of Washash, killing ten and injuring 18 more. Two days later a string of bombings and shootings took place all across the city - at least two police stations in the northwestern and central districts were attacked by suicide car bombers, killing 22 (including 13 policemen) and leaving at least 55 wounded. In total at least 29 people died on this day and 86 were injured.

{"title":"2011 Abuja United Nations bombing","article":"The 2011 Abuja bombing was a car bomb explosion on Friday, 26 August 2011 in the Nigerian capital Abuja's UN building that killed at least 21 and wounded 60. A spokesperson from the Sunni Islamist group Boko Haram later claimed responsibility.\n\nAt about 11:00 WAT in the diplomatic zone in the centre of the city the car bomb vehicle broke through two security barriers. Then its driver detonated the bomb after crashing it into the UN reception area. The bomb caused devastation to the building's lower floors. The building is said to be the headquarters for about 400 UN employees but it is not clear how many were inside the building at the time of the attack.\n\nA wing of the building collapsed and the ground floor of the building was badly damaged. Emergency services were quickly on the scene removing dead bodies from the building and rushing the wounded to hospital. Cranes have been brought to the blast site to move the mass of rubble and ensure that no-one is trapped there.\n\nThe blast killed at least 21 people and injured 73. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Viola Onwuliri, said: \"This is not an attack on Nigeria but on the global community. An attack on the world.\" UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon described the attack as an 'assault on those who devote themselves to helping others' The attack is the first suicide bombing in Nigeria to attack an international organisation.\n\nIn September 2011 the Nigerian Department of State Security alleged that Mamman Nur was the mastermind behind the attack and offered a \u20a626 million (US$160,000) bounty. Also four men appeared in an Abuja magistrates' court charged with organising the bombing, and were remanded in custody to a federal high court hearing.\n\n== References ==\n\n\n==See also==\n*October 2010 Abuja bombings\n*December 2010 Abuja bombing\n*2011 Abuja police headquarters bombing","urls":["https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/08\/29\/world\/africa\/29nigeria.html","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-africa-14677957","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/video\/2011\/aug\/26\/abuja-bombing-un-offices-nigeria","http:\/\/www.economist.com\/node\/21528307","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/africa\/nigerian-authorities-seek-alleged-mastermind-of-deadly-un-headquarters-bombing\/2011\/09\/18\/gIQAP9VhcK_story.html?cid=nlc-dailybrief-daily_news_brief-link19-20110919"]}
{"title":"2011 Norway attacks","article":"The 2011 Norway attacks, referred to in Norway as 22 July or as 22\/7, were two sequential lone wolf domestic terrorist\nattacks by Anders Behring Breivik against the government, the civilian population, and a Workers' Youth League (AUF) summer camp, in which 77 people were killed.\n\nThe first attack was a car bomb explosion in Oslo within Regjeringskvartalet, the executive government quarter of Norway, at 15:25:22 (CEST). The bomb was placed inside a van next to the tower block housing the office of the then Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg. The explosion killed eight people and injured at least 209 people, twelve severely.\n\nThe second attack occurred less than two hours later at a summer camp on the island of Ut\u00f8ya in Tyrifjorden, Viken. The camp was organized by the AUF, the youth division of the ruling Norwegian Labour Party (AP). Breivik, dressed in a homemade police uniform and showing false identification, took a ferry to the island and opened fire at the participants, killing 69 and injuring at least 110, 55 seriously. Among the dead were Stoltenberg's friends, and the stepbrother of Norway's crown princess Mette-Marit.\n\nThe attack was the deadliest in Norway since World War II and the shooting at Ut\u00f8ya remains the deadliest mass shooting by a lone perpetrator in history. A survey found that one in four Norwegians knew someone affected. The European Union, NATO and several countries expressed their support for Norway and condemned the attacks. The 2012 Gj\u00f8rv Report concluded that Norway's police could have prevented the bombing and caught Breivik faster at Ut\u00f8ya, and that measures to prevent further attacks and \"mitigate adverse effects\" should have been implemented.\n\nThe Norwegian Police arrested Anders Behring Breivik, a 32-year-old Norwegian right-wing extremist, on Ut\u00f8ya island and charged him with both attacks. His trial took place between 16 April and 22 June 2012 in Oslo District Court, where Breivik admitted carrying out the attacks, but denied criminal guilt and claimed the defense of necessity. On 24 August, Breivik was convicted as charged and sentenced to 21 years of preventive detention in prison, the maximum sentence allowed in Norway. The sentence can be extended indefinitely as long as the prisoner is deemed a threat to society.\n\n==Preparation for the attacks==\n\nBreivik claims to have begun the planning of the terrorist acts in 2002, at the age of 23. He had participated for years in debates on Internet forums and spoken against Islam and immigration. He was preparing for the attacks from at least as early as 2009, though he concealed his violent intentions.\n\n===Failed attempt to buy weapons in Prague===\n\nBreivik spent six days in Prague in late August and early September 2010. Following his Internet inquiry, Breivik noted that \"Prague is known for maybe being the most important transit site point for illicit drugs and weapons in Europe\". Despite the fact that Prague has one of the lowest crime rates among European capitals, Breivik expressed reservations about his personal safety, writing that (before his trip there) he believed Prague to be a dangerous place with \"many brutal and cynical criminals\".\n\nHe hollowed out the rear seats of his Hyundai Atos in order to have enough space for the firearms he hoped to buy. After two days, he got a prospectus for a mineral extraction business printed, which was supposed to give him an alibi in case someone suspected him of preparing a terrorist attack. He wanted to buy an AK-47-type rifle (this firearm is not common in the country, unlike the Vz. 58,), a Glock pistol, hand-grenades and a rocket-propelled grenade, stating that getting the latter two would be a \"bonus\".\n\nBreivik had several fake police badges printed to wear with a police uniform, which he had acquired illegally on the Internet, and which he later wore during the attack. Contrary to his expectations, he was unable to get any firearms in the Czech Republic, commenting that it was the \"first major setback in [his] operation\". In the end, he concluded that Prague was \"far from an ideal city to buy guns\", nothing like \"what the BBC reported\", and that he had felt \"safer in Prague than in Oslo\".\n\n===Arming in Norway and through the Internet===\n\nOriginally, Breivik intended to try to obtain weapons in Germany or Serbia if his mission in Prague failed. The Czech disappointment led him to procure his weapons through legal channels. He decided to obtain a semi-automatic rifle and a Glock pistol legally in Norway, noting that he had a \"clean criminal record, hunting license, and two guns (a Benelli Nova 12 gauge pump-action shotgun and a .308 bolt-action rifle) already for seven years\", and that obtaining the guns legally should therefore not be a problem.\n\n\nUpon returning to Norway, Breivik obtained a legal permit for a .223-caliber Ruger Mini-14 semi-automatic carbine, ostensibly for the purpose of hunting deer. He bought it in late 2010 for \u20ac1,400. He wanted to purchase a 7.62\u00d739mm Ruger Mini-30 semi-automatic carbine, but decided for unknown reasons to buy the Mini-14.\n\nGetting a permit for the pistol proved more difficult, as he had to demonstrate regular attendance at a sport shooting club. He also bought ten 30-round magazines for the rifle from a United States supplier, and six magazines for the pistol (including four 30-round magazines) in Norway. From November 2010 to January 2011 he went through 15 training sessions at the Oslo Pistol Club, and by mid-January his application to purchase a Glock pistol was approved.\n\nBreivik claimed in his manifesto that he bought 300 g of sodium nitrate from a Polish shop for . The Polish ABW interviewed the company owner on 24 July 2011. Breivik's Polish purchases initially led to his being placed on the watch list of the Norwegian intelligence, which did not act because they did not believe his actions were relevant to their terror concerns.\n\nHe had also planned a last religious service (in Frogner Church, Oslo) before the attack.\n\n====Breivik Geofarm====\nOn 18 May 2009 Behring Breivik created a sole proprietorship called Breivik Geofarm, a company established under the fictitious purpose of cultivating vegetables, melons, roots and tubers. The real purpose was to gain access to chemicals and materials, especially fertiliser that could be used for the production of explosives without arousing suspicion.\n\nThe place of business was given as \u00c5mot in Hedmark. On 4 May 2011, Breivik purchased  of fertilizer through Geofarm at Felleskj\u00f8pet,  of ammonium nitrate and  of calcium ammonium nitrate. According to neighbours, all the fertiliser was stored in his barn. After conducting a reconstruction of the bomb with equivalent amount of fertilizer on the farm in \u00c5mot, police and bomb experts concluded that the bomb had been , about the same size as the one used in the 2002 Bali bombings. Afterwards there was significant debate in Norway about how an amateur could acquire such substantial amounts of fertiliser and manufacture and place such a lethal weapon in the middle of Regjeringskvartalet all by himself. The conclusion by Felleskj\u00f8pet was that there is no legislation to keep agricultural businesses from buying as much fertiliser as they like, and that there was nothing suspicious about Breivik's purchase. This was confirmed by the director of the Norwegian Police Security Service, Janne Kristiansen, who stated \"not even the Stasi could have prevented this attack\".\n\nThe company listed at least two Swedish employees on the social networking site Facebook, but it is uncertain whether these people existed.\n\nIn April 2011 he reported moving from Oslo to V\u00e5lstua farm in the municipality of \u00c5mot, about  south of the community centre Rena, on the east side of Glomma. His agricultural company was run from the farm, and gave him access to ingredients for explosives.\n\nHis  car bomb exploded in central Oslo on 22 July 2011 where it killed eight people. He had between  of additional material that was left on the farm and could be used for construction of a second bomb.\n\n===Weapons training===\nBeside visiting firing ranges and countries with relaxed gun laws to sharpen his skill, Breivik's manifesto says that he made use of the video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 as a training aid while using World of Warcraft as a cover for his extended period of isolation. He also said that he honed his shooting skills using an in-game holographic sight similar to the one he used during the attacks.\n\n==Oslo bombing==\n\n\nOn 22 July 2011 at 15:25:22 (CEST) a bomb detonated in Regjeringskvartalet, central Oslo. The bomb was placed in a white Volkswagen Crafter and parked in front of the H block, housing the Office of the Prime Minister, Ministry of Justice and the Police, and several other governmental buildings, such as the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (R4), Ministry of Finance (G block), Ministry of Education and Research (Y block) and the Supreme Court of Norway (behind the G block).\n\nThe Crafter was registered by surveillance cameras as entering Grubbegata from Grensen at 15:13:23. The van stopped at 15:13:43,  before the H block. It stood still with the hazard warning lamps on for 1 minute and 54 seconds. The driver then drove the last 200 metres and parked the van in front of the main entrance of the main government building. The van was parked at 15:16:30. The front door of the van opened 16 seconds later and after another 16 seconds the driver stepped out of the van. He stood outside the van for 7 seconds before quickly walking away towards Hammersborg torg, where he had another car parked.\n\nThe driver was dressed like a police officer and had a gun in his hand. A police helmet with a face shield was covering his face. Breivik was not positively identified.\n\nThe explosion started fires in the H block and R4, and the shock wave blew out the windows on all floors as well as in the VG house and other buildings on the other side of the square. The streets in the area were filled with glass and debris. A cloud of white smoke was reported as a fire continued to burn at the Department of Oil and Energy. The blast was heard at least  away.\n\nAt 15:26 the police received the first message about the explosion, and at 15:28 the first police patrol reported arriving at the scene. At the same time, news agency NTB was told that the Prime Minister was unhurt and safe.\n\nA witness called police at 15:34 to report a person in a police uniform holding a pistol in his hand, entering an unmarked vehicle, a Fiat Dobl\u00f2. Information\u2014including the vehicle's license plate number and description of the suspect\u2014was written on a yellow note, and hand delivered to the police operations central where it lay for twenty minutes before the witness was phoned back. The license plate number was not transmitted on the police radio until two hours later.\n\nFollowing the explosion, police cleared the area and searched for any additional explosive devices. Through media outlets, police urged citizens to evacuate central Oslo.\n\nPolice later announced that the bomb was composed of a mixture of fertilizer and fuel oil (ANFO), similar to that used in the Oklahoma City bombing.\nThe blast was caught on many security cameras.\n\n===Impact on transportation===\n\nImmediately after the explosion, the area surrounding the damaged buildings was cordoned off and evacuated. People were asked to remain calm and leave the city centre if possible, but there was no general evacuation. The Oslo Metro remained operational, and most of the Oslo tram network was also running, although sporadically, except for the line through Grensen (the street between Prof. Aschehoug's plass and Stortorvet). Buses also continued to run, although at least one articulated bus on the No.37 line, which stops outside the Ministry of Finance, was commandeered to evacuate the walking wounded.\n\nAn e-mail communication with the BBC from a traveller indicated that police were conducting searches in suspicious cars on the road to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which remained open.\n\nThe Gardermoen Line between Lillestr\u00f8m and Oslo Airport was shut down after a suspicious package was found close to the tracks. The same happened at the offices of TV 2 which were evacuated after a suspicious package was found outside the building.\n\n==Ut\u00f8ya massacre ==\n\n\n===Attack===\nApproximately one and a half hours after the Oslo explosion, Breivik, dressed in a police uniform and presenting himself as \"Martin Nilsen\" from the Oslo Police Department, boarded the ferry  at Ut\u00f8ykaia in Tyrifjorden, a lake some  northwest of Oslo, to the island of Ut\u00f8ya, the location of the Norwegian Labour Party's AUF youth camp. The camp is held there every summer and was attended by approximately 600 teenagers.\n\nWhen Breivik arrived on the island, he presented himself as a police officer who had come over for a routine check following the bombing in Oslo. He was met by Monica B\u00f8sei, the camp leader and island hostess. B\u00f8sei probably became suspicious and contacted Trond Berntsen, the security officer on the island, before Breivik killed them both. He then signalled and asked people to gather around him before pulling weapons and ammunition from a bag and firing indiscriminately, killing and wounding numerous people. He first shot people on the island and later started shooting at people who were trying to escape by swimming across the lake. Survivors on the island described a scene of terror. Survivor Dana Barzingi, then 21, described how several victims wounded by Breivik pretended to be dead, but he came back and shot them again. He spared an 11-year-old boy who had lost his father (Trond Berntsen) during the shooting and stood up against him and said he was too young to die, as well as a 22-year-old man who begged for his life.\n\nSome witnesses hid in undergrowth and lavatories, communicating by text message to avoid revealing their positions. The mass shooting lasted for around an hour and a half, ending when a police special task force arrived and Brevik surrendered, despite having ammunition left, at 18:35. The shooter used hollow-point or frangible bullets which increase tissue damage. Breivik repeatedly shouted \"You are going to die today, Marxists!\"\n\nB\u00f8sei's husband and one of her daughters, who were also present, survived. The youngest victim, New Zealand-born Sharidyn Svebakk-B\u00f8hn of Drammen, was 14 years old. 16-year-old Andrine Bakkene Espeland of Sarpsborg was the last victim, nearly one hour after the shooting began.\n\nResidents in a flotilla of motorboats and fishing dinghies sailed out to rescue the survivors, who were pulled out shivering and bleeding from the water and picked up from hiding places in the bushes and behind rocks around the island's shoreline. Some survived by pretending to be dead. Several campers, especially those who knew the island well, swam to the island's rocky west side and hid in the caves which are only accessible from the water. Others were able to hide away on the secluded Kj\u00e6rlighetsstien (\"love path\"). Forty-seven of the campers sought refuge in Skolestua (\"the School House\") together with personnel from the Norwegian People's Aid. Although Breivik fired two bullets through the door, he did not get through the locked door, and the people inside this building survived.\n\nThe teenagers said that they had decided that it was too difficult to stop the gunman. They discovered a cave-like opening in a rock where they hid 23 children from Breivik. Dzhamayev, who kept guard outside, also dragged three youngsters from the lake who were close to drowning.\n\nFormer prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, whom Breivik said he hated and, in a pun on the (more or less ironic) epithet Landsmoderen (\"mother of the nation\"), referred to in his writings as landsmorderen (\"murderer of the nation\"), had been on the island earlier in the day to give a speech to the camp. After the attack Breivik stated that he originally wanted to target her specifically; but because of delays related to the renovation of Oslo Central railway station, he arrived after she had already left.\n\n===Rescue and emergency response===\nThe first shot was fired at 17:22. The emergency medical services were informed about the shooting two minutes later. One minute after that the police in Oslo were informed. They immediately tried to reach Ut\u00f8ya as quickly as possible, but did not have a helicopter that could take them straight to the island. By 17:30, the anti-terror police in Oslo (the Emergency Response Unit) were on the way to Ut\u00f8ya by automobile.\n\nOne of the first to arrive on the scene was Marcel Gleffe, a German resident of Ski staying at Utvika Camping on the mainland. Recognizing gunshots, he piloted his boat to the island and began throwing life-jackets to young people in the water, rescuing as many as he could in four or five trips, after which the police asked him to stop. The Daily Telegraph credited him with saving up to 30 lives. Another forty were saved by Hege Dalen and Toril Hansen, a married couple on vacation in the area. Dalen was helping from land while Hansen and a neighbour camper made several trips to rescue people in the water. Several dozen more were rescued by Kasper Ilaug, who made three trips to the island. Ilaug, a local resident, received a telephone call that \"something terrible\" was happening on Ut\u00f8ya and requesting help. He initially thought the call was a prank, but acted anyway. Altogether, some 150 who swam away from the island were pulled out of the lake by campers on the opposite shore.\n\nThe anti-terror police reached the meeting point at 18:09, but had to wait a few minutes for a boat to take them across. They reached Ut\u00f8ya at 18:25. When confronted by the heavily armed police on the island, the gunman initially hesitated for a few seconds. When an officer yelled \"surrender or be shot\" he laid down his weapons.\n\nAnders Breivik called the 112 emergency phone number at least twice to surrender, at 18:01 and 18:26, and continued killing people in between. The police say Breivik hung up both times; they tried to call him back but did not succeed.\n\nWhen the police arrived at the scene, they were met by survivors begging the officers to throw away their weapons, as they were afraid that the men in uniforms would again open fire on them.\n\nDuring the attack, 69 people were killed, and of the 517 survivors, 66 were wounded.\n\n====Shortage of transport capacity====\nThe Norwegian police do not have helicopters suitable for transporting groups of police for an airdrop. The one they have is useful only for surveillance and the helicopter crew were on holiday.\n\nWhen the local police arrived at Ut\u00f8ykaia, less than 30 minutes after the first shot was fired, they could not find a suitable boat to reach the island. They were then ordered to observe and report.\n\nAUF's own ferry, the 50 passenger MS Thorbj\u00f8rn, was used by Breivik to go to Ut\u00f8ya. Shortly after the first shot was fired, nine people were leaving the island on the ferry, among them the AUF leader Eskil Pedersen. They feared there might be more terrorists in the area and navigated the ferry  to the north. Hence the ferry was not available to the police when they arrived at Ut\u00f8ykaia, the normal ferry landing on the mainland.\n\nThe police therefore had to use their own rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB). The day of the event, this boat was located in H\u00f8nefoss, and had to be transported to the lake and launched before it could be used. When the anti-terror police boarded the RHIB it took on some water and after a few hundred meters, the engine stopped, probably due to water in the fuel. Two minutes later they took over a civilian boat that was sent to assist them. The episode was captured on video. A minute or two after the video ends, a faster civilian boat arrived to help. Four police officers from the anti-terror police boarded the boat. Not wanting to waste any more time, the civilian couple took the police to Ut\u00f8ya.\n\nSome have criticised the police for not using a helicopter, for not immediately getting into small boats, and for endangering the couple who drove the civilian boat.\n\n===Arrest of innocent survivor===\nOn arriving in Ut\u00f8ya, the police arrested, in addition to Breivik, Anzor Djoukaev, an innocent 17-year-old survivor who represented the Akershus branch of AUF. The youth was reportedly stripped naked and locked up in a jail cell, located only meters away from the cell housing the self-confessed killer. The victim, who as a child had witnessed mass murders in Chechnya, was suspected of being an accomplice because his haircut was different from that shown on his identity document, and because he did not react to the carnage with the same tears and hysteria as most of the other survivors. He was kept in custody for seventeen hours. Lawyer Harald Stabell criticized the police for failing to contact the youth's family, who feared he was killed, and for interrogating the victim without a lawyer present.\n\n==Casualties==\n\nThe attacks were the deadliest in Norway since World War II, and a survey found that one in four Norwegians knew \"someone affected by the attacks\". It is also the fifth deadliest terrestrial terrorist attack in Western Europe behind the Bologna bombing in 1980, the Nice attack in 2016, the Paris attacks in November 2015, and the Madrid train bombings in 2004.\n\n===Oslo===\nEight people were killed in the explosion; the blast, shock wave and debris immediately killed six people, while two others died quickly afterwards from their wounds. Of the 325 people estimated to have been in the government buildings, around them and in the surrounding area, at least 209 people received physical injuries from the blast and debris. While most were relatively minor and could be treated at the local casualty clinic, 12 people received more serious injuries. Ten were sent to Ullev\u00e5l University Hospital (OUS, Ullev\u00e5l), four with moderate to serious and six with critical injuries, and two to Aker University Hospital (OUS, Aker). A doctor at one of the Oslo University Hospitals (OUS) said the hospital staff were treating head, chest and abdominal wounds.\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Jens Stoltenberg was at his official residence near the Royal Palace, preparing the speech he was scheduled to give at Ut\u00f8ya the next day. Norway's finance minister, Sigbj\u00f8rn Johnsen, was on vacation in Denmark at the time.\n\nFewer people than usual were in the area because the bombing took place during July, the usual holiday month for Norwegians, and since it was Friday afternoon, most government employees had gone home for the weekend.\n\n===Ut\u00f8ya===\nThe scope of what happened at the island was initially very confusing, and the first official figures given was that at least 10 people had been killed. As the evening progressed several eyewitness reports put this number in doubt, and at approximately 03:50 (CEST) on 23 July, NRK1 and TV2, the two primary Norwegian television networks, broadcast a live press conference from the \"Sentrum politistasjon\" in Oslo where Norway's National Police Commissioner \u00d8ystein M\u00e6land stated the number of fatalities at Ut\u00f8ya to have reached \"at least 80\" with the count expected to increase.\n\nOn 25 July, a police spokesperson revealed that the death toll of the victims on Ut\u00f8ya had been revised downwards to 68 after the casualties had been counted on their return to the mainland. They added that the number of people missing was still high and that the number of casualties could be as high as 86. On 29 July police announced that one of the severely wounded victims from Ut\u00f8ya had died in hospital, bringing the death toll from the island massacre to 69.\n\nOn 26 July, the Norwegian police began releasing the names and dates of birth of the victims on their website. By 29 July, the names of all 77 victims (8 from the bomb attack, 69 from Ut\u00f8ya) had been published, the last, a shooting victim, having been found on the 28th.\n\n\n\nOf the 69 people who died at the attack on the island, 57 were killed by one or more shots through the head. In total, 67 people were killed by gunshots, 1 died falling from a cliff trying to escape, and 1 drowned trying to swim away from the island. In total, Breivik fired at least 186 shots, and still had a \"considerable amount of ammunition\" left.\n\nIn the aftermath, of the 564 people on the island at the time, 69 people died and at least 110 people had received various physical injuries. An estimated 50 people were treated at the locally set up casualty clinic, and were treated for relatively minor injuries such as cuts, bruises and hypothermia after fleeing and swimming from the island. It was cloudy and rainy on Ut\u00f8ya that day, air temperature was varying between , water temperature around the island was 14\u00a0\u00b0C and the shortest distance to the mainland was around 600 meters. Sixty people were transported to surrounding hospitals, 55 with serious to critical injuries. The chief surgeon who treated the wounds at one of the hospitals said he had never seen similar wounds during his 23 years of practice, and explained that the bullets were extremely fragmented in their path through the body. Thirty-three people had been directly hit by one or more bullets and survived, but one person who was shot died two days later in hospital from the bullet wounds to the head and back.\n\nThe 564 people on the island at the time were from all over Norway as well as some visitors from foreign countries. The people who died were from 18 of Norway's 19 counties, and also a woman from Georgia. Wounded people were from the entire country, including Svalbard, and together with the casualties from Oslo, an average of a quarter of Norway's population knew a victim affected by the attacks, according to a survey done. Several of the dead and wounded, or their parents, were personal friends of high-ranking government ministers. Trond Berntsen, an off-duty, unarmed police officer and step-brother of Norway's crown princess Mette-Marit, was the first to be shot dead.\n\n==Perpetrator==\n\n\nPublic broadcaster NRK and several other Norwegian media outlets identified the suspected attacker as Anders Behring Breivik. He was arrested on Ut\u00f8ya for the shootings and also linked to the Oslo bombing. He was charged with terrorism for both attacks. According to his attorney, Breivik acknowledged that he was responsible for both the bomb and the shooting during interrogation but denied culpability, as he asserted that his actions were \"atrocious but necessary\". At his initial arraignment on 25 July, Breivik was remanded into custody for eight weeks, the first half to be in solitary confinement. Breivik wanted to have an open hearing, and attend it wearing a uniform of his own design, but both requests were denied by the presiding judge. \n\n===Mental health===\nFollowing his arrest, Breivik underwent examination by court-appointed forensic psychiatrists, who diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia and concluded he had been psychotic at the time of the attacks and was criminally insane. Although criticised in newspaper debates, the submitted report was approved with no remarks by the Norwegian Board of Forensic Medicine after an extended panel of experts had reviewed it.\n\nAccording to his defense attorney, Breivik initially expressed surprise and felt insulted by the conclusions in the report. He later stated that \"this provides new opportunities\". Following the criticism of the psychiatric report, the court in January 2012 approved the conduct of a second psychiatric examination. The report from this examination declared Breivik to be sane in April 2012. Ultimately, the verdict and ruling of the district court's five-judge panel agreed that Breivik was sane.\n\n===Political and religious views===\nBreivik is linked to a 1,518-page compendium entitled 2083: A European Declaration of Independence bearing the name \"Andrew Berwick\". The file was e-mailed to 1,003 addresses about 90 minutes before the bomb blast in Oslo. Analysts described him as having Islamophobic views and a hatred of Islam, and as someone who considered himself as a knight dedicated to stemming the tide of Muslim immigration into Europe.\n\nThe introductory chapter of the manifesto defining \"cultural Marxism\" is a copy of Political Correctness: A Short History of an Ideology by the Free Congress Foundation. Major parts of the compendium are attributed to the pseudonymous Norwegian blogger Fjordman. The text also copies sections of the Unabomber manifesto, without giving credit, while substituting the words \"cultural Marxists\" for \"leftists\" and \"Muslims\" for \"black people\". The New York Times described American influences in the writings, noting that the compendium mentions the anti-Islamist American Robert Spencer 64 times and cites Spencer's works at great length. The work of Bat Ye'or is cited dozens of times. Far-right and anti-Islam activist blogger Pamela Geller, Neo-pagan writer Koenraad Elst and Daniel Pipes are also mentioned as sources of inspiration. The manifesto further contains quotes from Middle East expert Bernard Lewis, Edmund Burke, Mahatma Gandhi, Thomas Jefferson and George Orwell, as well as from Jeremy Clarkson's Sunday Times column and Melanie Phillips' Daily Mail column. The publication speaks in admiration of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Bruce Bawer, Sr\u0111a Trifkovi\u0107, and Henryk M. Broder. The compendium advocates a restoration of patriarchy, which it claims would save European culture.\n\nThe compendium contains his militant far-right ideology and xenophobic worldview, which espouses an array of political concepts; including support for varying degrees of cultural conservatism, right-wing populism, ultranationalism, Islamophobia, far-right Zionism, and Serbian paramilitarism. It regards Islam and \"cultural Marxism\" as the enemy and argues for the annihilation of \"Eurabia\" and multiculturalism, to preserve a Christian Europe. He further urged Europeans to restore the historic crusades against Islam as in the Middle Ages. A video Breivik released on YouTube 6 hours before the attack has been described as promoting violence towards leftists and Islamists who reside in Western Europe.\n\nAmong other things, in the manifesto he identified the Bene\u0161 Decrees, which facilitated the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia after the Second World War, as an example for committing that act on European Muslims. In his manifesto he also urges the Hindus to drive Muslims out of India. He demands the gradual deportation of all Muslims from Europe from 2011 to 2083 through repatriation. He blames feminism for allowing the erosion of the fabric of European society.\n\nBreivik's writings mention the English Defence League, claiming that he had contact with senior members of the EDL, and that a Norwegian version of the group was 'in the process of gaining strength'. He wrote that the EDL were 'na\u00efve fools' because in his words the EDL 'harshly condemns any and all revolutionary conservative movements that employ terror as a tool'. EDL leader Tommy Robinson denounced Breivik and the attack on 26 July 2011 and denied any links with the Norwegian.\n\nAfter being apprehended, Breivik was characterized by police officials as being a right-wing extremist. Breivik is described by the newspaper Verdens Gang as considering himself a conservative nationalist. According to The Australian, Breivik was highly critical of Muslim immigration into Christian societies, is pro-Israel and an admirer of the Tea Party movement in the United States. Deputy police chief Roger Andresen initially told reporters that \"We have no more information than\u00a0... what has been found on [his] own websites, which is that it goes towards the right and that it is, so to speak, Christian fundamentalist.\" Subsequently, others have disputed Andresen's characterization of Breivik as a Christian fundamentalist. Furthermore, Breivik stated that \"myself and many more like me do not necessarily have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and God.\" According to the International Business Times, in his manifesto, he \"did not see himself as religious\", but he did identify as a cultural Christian and wrote about the differences between cultural and religious Christians, but stressed that both were Christians, and shared the same identity and goals. After his imprisonment, Breivik stated he had never personally identified as a Christian, and called his religion Odinism, stating that he would \"pray and sacrifice\" to Odin. He also identified himself as a fascist and a national socialist, stating that he previously exploited counterjihadist rhetoric in order to protect \"ethno-nationalists\".\n\nHe has written many posts on the far-right website document.no. He attended meetings of \"Documents venner\" (Friends of Document), affiliated with the Document.no website. He is a former member of the Progress Party (FrP) and its youth wing FpU. According to the current FpU leader Ove Vanebo, Breivik was active early in the 2000s, but he left the party as his viewpoints became more extreme.\n\nIn his online YouTube video, he expressed admiration of past European leaders who waged war against Islam and Muslims, naming Charles Martel, Richard the Lionheart, El Cid, Vlad the Impaler, Jacques de Molay, Tsar Nicholas, and John III Sobieski. A recently created social media website bearing Breivik's name and picture but of unknown authorship refers to him as an admirer of Winston Churchill and Max Manus, and also of controversial Dutch politician Geert Wilders, whose political party, the Party for Freedom, he describes as \"the only true party of conservatives\". The music that is played in the video comes off the soundtrack to the video game Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures.\n\n===Unsubstantiated claims of Breivik being assisted===\nThere was suspicion at the time of the attack that there were accomplices, and the police initially prepared to meet two to five shooters on Ut\u00f8ya. Several youths at Ut\u00f8ya reported to be convinced that there was more than one shooter, with some reports of shots fired from the mainland. A second shooter at Ut\u00f8ya was described by several youths as having thick dark hair, about 1.80 meters tall who did not wear a police uniform, while carrying a pistol and a rifle. During judicial examination, at least two witnesses independently of each other both described two different shooters at Ut\u00f8ya, while a third witness was reported to have swum from the island beside a previously unknown dark-haired man. After his arrest Breivik claimed he acted with accomplices, but later changed his statements to his acting alone, giving several demands for him to tell about accomplices. On 24 July 2011, six people were arrested in Oslo suspected of having connections with the attacks; all were released. The police later issued a statement that there was only found evidence of one shooter at Ut\u00f8ya, amid \"widespread conspiracy theories\" of there having been more than one shooter.\n\nIn the initial hours after the attacks, the group Ansar al-Jihad al-Alami led by Abu Suleiman al-Naser claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\n==Reactions==\n\n\n\n===Domestic===\nKing Harald V sent his condolences to the victims and their families, and urged unity. He and Queen Sonja personally visited the victims of the attacks, as well as the families of those killed.\n\nAt a press conference the morning after the attacks, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg and Justice Minister Knut Storberget addressed the country. Stoltenberg called the attack a \"national tragedy\" and the worst atrocity in Norway since World War II. Stoltenberg further vowed that the attack would not hurt Norwegian democracy, and said the proper answer to the violence was \"more democracy, more openness, but not naivety\". In his speech at the memorial service on 24 July 2011, he opined what would be a proper reaction: \"No one has said it better than the AUF girl who was interviewed by CNN: 'If one man can show so much hate, think how much love we could show, standing together.'\"\n\n\n\nThe leader of the Workers' Youth League, Eskil Pedersen, vowed to \"return to Ut\u00f8ya\" and urged Norway to continue its tradition of openness and tolerance.\n\nLeaders of Norwegian political parties expressed grief and sent condolences in public statements.\n\nOn 1 August 2011, Norway's parliament, nominally in recess for the summer, reconvened for an extraordinary session to honour the victims of the attack. In a departure from parliamentary procedure, both King Harald V and Crown Prince Haakon were present. The president of Norway's Parliament, Dag Terje Andersen, read out loud the names of all 77 victims. The session was open to the public, but due to limited seating, priority was given to relatives of the deceased.\n\nThe seven political parties in the parliament agreed to postpone the electoral campaign for local elections, held in September, until mid-August. School debates were cancelled, though the school elections were not.\n\nInitially, Magnus Ranstorp and other terror experts suspected that foreigners were behind the attacks. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, there were wide reports in mainstream media of non-ethnic Norwegians, especially Muslim Norwegians, being subjected to harassment and violence. A report about these racist attacks was published on behalf of the 22. July Commission in 2012.\n\nOn 13 August 2012, Norway's prime minister received the Gj\u00f8rv Report, which concludes that Breivik could have been stopped from carrying out the Ut\u00f8ya massacre. (The report had been ordered by parliament, in August 2011.)\n\n===International===\nThe United Nations, the European Union, NATO, and governments around the world expressed their condemnation of the attacks, condolences, and solidarity with Norway. However, there have also been reports of Western European right-wing populist politicians giving support to the killings or excusing them as a result of multi-culturalism. Interviewed on a popular radio show, the Italian MEP Francesco Speroni, a leading member of the Lega Nord, the junior partner in Berlusconi's conservative coalition, said: \"Breivik's ideas are in defence of western civilisation.\" Similar views were voiced by Italian MEP Mario Borghezio. Werner Koenigshofer, a member of the National Council of Austria, was expelled from the right-wing Freedom Party of Austria after equating the massacre with the death of millions of fetuses through abortion.\n\nOn 25 July 2011, at noon (CEST), each of the Nordic countries held a minute of silence to dignify the victims of the two attacks. Norway's minute of silence stretched to five minutes. In Oslo, a city of approximately 600,000 inhabitants, an estimated 200,000 people attended a \"flower march\".\n\nThe Norwegian media reported criticism against Fox News and its commentator Glenn Beck for their coverage of the attacks. Beck's comparison of the AUF to the Hitler Youth led Frank Aarebrot, a Norwegian professor with political sympathies to the Norwegian Labour Party, to call Beck a \"fascist\" and \"swine\".\n\n===Memorial ceremonies===\nA number of memorial ceremonies took place following the attacks. On 25 July 2011, around 200,000 people took part in a \"rose march\" at R\u00e5dhusplassen in Oslo. The NRK memorial concert, titled \"Mitt lille land\" (\"My Little Country\") and named for the song \"Mitt lille land\" which \"came to symbolize the sorrow many people went through\", took place in Oslo Cathedral on 30 July 2011. A national memorial ceremony took place on 21 August 2011. In September 2011, the Norwegian People's Aid and Sony Music released the memorial album Mitt lille land.\n\n===Memorials and symbol===\nA minnestein (\"memorial stone\") to commemorate the attacks at Ut\u00f8ya is located at a roadside rest area with a view of Ut\u00f8ya that is located on E16 at Nes in Hole (municipality).\n\nAt Ut\u00f8ya, the place of memorial is called [\"the clearing\"] \"Lysninga\"; a part of it is [\"the ring\"] \"Ringen\" \u2013 a \"ring of steel [that] hangs between trees and here the names and age of the majority of those 69 killed are engraved\"; \"it lies at the highest point of the island\"; It was unveiled during summer 2015. Hegnhuset was inaugurated in 2016, and media were allowed to photograph its interior including items of memorial after the bereaved who chose to come, had seen the interior.\n\nOne monolith stands in each municipality. There are memorials in the 53 affected municipalities in Norway who welcomed the same sculpture, funded by a private donation, created by the artist Nico Widerberg.\n\nA temporary national monument in Oslo was unveiled on 22 July 2016. On 20 September 2016 media said that a planned permanent, national memorial in Oslo at Regjeringskvartalet is dependent on a memorial at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten being constructed as planned. But the government has opened for scrapping Dahlberg's design.\n\nAnother proposed monument in Oslo, at Stensparken, including metal roses, has not been authorized, as its planned dimensions of  by , with a height of , were judged to be too overwhelming. 900 roses, still in storage, have been donated from persons in various countries; one rose was created by a survivor, and some by others who were bereaved; Tobbe Malm is one of those who came up with the idea of using iron roses.\n\n====National memorial at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten, in limbo====\n\n, Hole Municipality has stopped case work regarding the request for permission to build a national monument at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten; media said that the case work could be arrested for around two and a half years or longer. The government is scheduled to be a defendant in court during a three-week trial, starting 25 April 2017; the underlying lawsuit aims to deny construction at the planned location.\n\nPreviously, in March 2016 the location for a planned national place of memorial was moved from Ut\u00f8ya to S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten \u2013 located on the mainland  from Utvika and   from Ut\u00f8ya; in September 2014 the Hole municipal council had refused a memorial at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten. The names of several of the victims are reportedly being denied (, by next of kin) as inscriptions on the planned monument.\n\nA committee, Kunstutvalget for minnestaden for 22. juli, chose  a design by Jonas Dahlberg for the monument, and Karin Moe has called the planned monument at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten \u2014 \"Breivik's Memorial Place\". Later, in a Klassekampen article Moe said that \"Many of the [local] inhabitants have described [..] the design as a violation, even a rape of nature [that is in place] at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten. Such is the intensity of how the memorial is being felt, that physical pain is felt merely by imagining having to face the memorial every day. The traumatised neighbors re-live the acts of terror through the brutal cut into the mountain slope [...] a reminder of who acted: Anders Behring Breivik. Here his misdeed is carved in stone. No wonder that fear lies in the reactions. [...] The baffling thing for the locals is this: [...], but we were supposed to be honored \u2013 not re-traumatised. Why must this incurable memorial-wound be inflicted on us, so close to [our bodies or our] life\". Furthermore, she said that \"Long time was needed before the September 11 memorial place on Manhattan was in place. Now an encompassing \u2013 in regard to ethics and aesthetics \u2013 pause for thinking is needed \u2013 both for the placement and the final design of the memorial\". A later article suggested that \"we create the monument as envisioned, but fill the scar with rock and beautify the surface\", inspired by kintsugi. A later article said that \"What many of us don't understand is why these plans, apparently not well-considered, now are pushed through. (...) Is it [because of] prestige or out of consideration to the artist\"?\n\nMinister of Local Government and Modernisation has been criticised for announcing \u2013 while Breivik was a plaintiff in a 4-day trial \u2013 the [current] decision to construct the monument.\n\nOn 14 April 2016 media said that a \"report has indicated that the place of memorial will create great mental strains on the persons living in its close proximity\"; The report, Nasjonalt kunnskapssenter om vold og traumatisk stress a\/s, was completed in April 2015. A later newspaper article asked \"And why should the little island [sic], [S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten be punished with the j\u00f6tunn cut \u2013 what wrong has the island done?\" On 16 April 2016 media quoted board member Anne-Gry Ruud of neighborhood association, Utstranda Velforening: \"I don't think that the work of art honors all who were killed, but symbolizes only pain and open wounds. (...) If this work of art gives any associations, then they are to terror, death, pain and the inadequacy of society. (...) This is not just a small cut on a point \u2013 it is an area of 1.2 decare [that will become surrounded by water] (...). I don't think that the [local] inhabitants have a responsibility to provide a location for a memorial at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten. Especially in the summer we experience a steady flow of tourists on a pilgrimage to S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten. Some take selfies with Ut\u00f8ya in the background. Others stop the inhabitants and ask what they did that day and how we contributed. (...) We have two schoolbuses that drive back and forth every day on the road just above, others pass on their way to the store, leisure activities, work or municipal center (...) 260 inhabitants\".\n\nThe national convention of the Progress Party decided to say \"no\" to placing the memorial at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten.\n\nOn 25 April 2016 Hole Municipal Council decided to fund Norwegian kroner 25,000 to Utstranda Velforening, for a proposed lawsuit against the government.\n\nIn a 14 May 2016 Aftenposten article , a film director and -producer, said that the monument of the original contest was supposed to have a price limited to Norwegian kroner 20 million; now that the government has estimated the price to 70 million including relevant extra expenses, the contestants that operated within the original price limits have been deceived.\n\nIn May 2016 the government wrote that the ongoing lawsuit about [placing] the monument [at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten], will not change the government's plans; the letter was signed by Minister of Local Government and Modernisation and Minister of Culture.\n\nIn an 11 June 2016 Dagbladet article Hans Normann Dahl was quoted, \"The monument itself is incomprehensible, and the idea so crass that it contains a negative and destructive material\".\n\nAn 18 June 2016 Dagbladet article quoted (writings of) one mother (Gunn Rusten) who lost her daughter: \"My daughter's name will NOT be displayed on any memorial at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten, but it is displayed at Ut\u00f8ya\". She added that \"Why should all the phenomenal persons living there, and who put their lives on the line that day \u2013 to save as many as possible of those on Ut\u00f8ya [who were later rescued from the lake] \u2014 have this as a lifelong, daily reminder of the fateful Friday when police and those in charge let a crazy man walk around for around an hour and a half \u2013 and kill at will \u2013 without intervening\". Furthermore, another mother (Mai Britt Rogne) who lost her daughter said that: \"We already have the grave, [and] Ut\u00f8ya, and one monolith in every municipality. How many places of memorial do we need\"?\n\nOn 24 June 2016 the government was sued (in Ringerike District Court) with a claim that \"The government is being denied construction of the memorial Memory Wound, including a parking lot, a footpath, and auxiliary developments at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten and Bergli [both] in Hole\".\n\n the government has offered to ditch the \"Memory Wound\"  draft for a monument; the site for a national memorial at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten, remains unchanged.\n\nSwedish psychiatrist Per-Olof Michel said \"I have been thinking why the government was in such a hurry. In Sweden one will be unveiling the Tsunami Monument next year \u2013 13 years after the fact. Regarding something that affects so many people, on should let time pass and go thru things again\".\n\nBodil Cappelen said in a Klassekampen article that \"Centuries will pass ... Oh, yes. Here they have cut off a point\u2014from the mountain mama. A landscape was not that much worth\u2014then\".\n\nRegarding \"Memory Wound\" possibly being plagiarism of one of 300 candidate proposals for the pre-qualification in the contest for monument design, art historian  said that \"My first impression was that this is closest [to] plagiarism\"; \"But when the idea is so similar, I think one should examine the case further\"; [the final written work for the master's degree,] masteroppgaven, of architect students Kristin Ulrikke R\u00f8nnestad og Hildegunn Slotn\u00e6s had already been published on NTNU's website, and had been exhibited in Trondheim, and had been mailed to around 200 persons and offices.\nSo far the case has led to: government agency  informing Dahlberg and the Department of Culture of potential allegations of plagiarism; Dahlberg denied any knowledge of masteroppgaven; student R\u00f8nnestad met with the director of KORO in April 2014. The lawyer (from the architects' trade union) that accompanied R\u00f8nnestad there, said that KORO showed \"a quite condescending attitude towards her\". Other views regarding the case includes the view of Arve R\u00f8d, art critic of Dagbladet, saying about the sketches \"The likeness is peculiar, and impossible to overlook. It is difficult not to conclude that these are two completely alike ideas, but I can not from that claim that Dahlberg has plagiarized the work of the two students\"; he thinks that it is quite remarkable that [two] ideas, so alike, were found in the same contest and situation, in the same place and at the same time.\n\nIn November 2016 news broke that case work regarding the request for permission to build the monument at S\u00f8rbr\u00e5ten, had been arrested in September; Hole municipality's justification, cited in part the upcoming court case.\n\n====The preserved, shattered display case for newspaper pages====\n\nA newspaper display case that was collaterally damaged has been left unrepaired with its glass fractured but not dislocated by the shockwave of the bomb. It has later been moved across the street \u2013 Akersgata \u2013 from outside the headquarters of Verdens Gang. Artist Ahmad Ghossein took the initiative to create a memorial from the shattered display. The newspaper edition from the day of the bombing, is still on display.\n\n===Attempts at art creation===\n\nA 2016 Norwegian news article said that \"Most of those that work in the field of art, probably were aware of the support group's [\"the national support group after 22 July incidents\"  ] marked attempts at stopping the Danish playwright   when he wanted to stage a drama based on the terrorist's manuscript. Artists are in fact not as daring, as many like to think\".\n\n\n==Legal proceedings==\n\nThe police initially kept the choice of counsel secret after request from the attorney. Attorney Geir Lippestad elected to act on behalf of Breivik's defense; Breivik had specifically requested that Lippestad become his attorney.\n\nOn 25 July 2011, Anders Behring Breivik was arraigned in Oslo District Court. The police feared that Breivik would use the hearing as an opportunity to communicate with possible accomplices. Because of this, the arraignment was held completely closed to the media and all other spectators. Instead, judge Kim Heger held a press conference shortly afterwards where he read the court's decision. The practice of completely closed court hearings is extremely rare in the Norwegian justice system.\n\nThe debate over which criminal charges to file was fierce. Many police attorneys wanted high treason or crimes against humanity. The prosecution ended up indicting Breivik on terrorism charges. Breivik admitted to being the gunman at Ut\u00f8ya and the perpetrator behind the Oslo bomb, also admitting all the other actual events. Nonetheless he pleaded not guilty, stating \"I do not recognise this justice system\". District Attorney Christian Hatlo asked that Breivik be detained for eight weeks without mail or visitation. The judge ruled in favor of the prosecution, stating \"the accused is an imminent danger to society and must be confined for the safety of himself and others. It is highly probable that he is guilty of the alleged crimes and imprisonment is necessary to prevent destruction of evidence\". In accordance with the prosecution's wishes, Breivik was remanded to eight weeks detention without mail or visitation, four of those in complete isolation, to be renewed no later than 19 September 2011. He was immediately transferred to Ila Landsfengsel, a maximum security prison.\n\nOn 13 August 2011 Breivik was taken to Ut\u00f8ya by police to recreate his actions on the day of the massacre. Neither the media nor the public was alerted to the operation. The police explained that the surprise walk-through was necessary because Breivik will be charged and tried for all 77 murders individually. The police deemed it less offensive to the survivors to do it now rather than during the trial. Despite the many police boats and helicopters, none of the civilians who had come to lay down flowers on the shore this day perceived what was happening just a few hundred metres across the lake from them for a total of eight hours. On the evening of 14 August the police held a press conference about the reconstruction. It was reported that Breivik was not unmoved by his return to Ut\u00f8ya, but that he showed no remorse. Inspector P\u00e5l Fredrik Hjort Kraby described Breivik's behavior and indifference on the island as \"unreal\", as he had over the course of eight hours willingly showed the police exactly how he had carried out all of the 69 murders.\n\nThe trial began on 16 April 2012 and lasted until 19 June 2012. 170 media organisations were accredited to cover the proceedings. Anders Behring Breivik acknowledged that he had committed the offences but pleaded not guilty as he believed the killing was needed. The main issue for Breivik was that he was not to be deemed \"insane\" or \"psychotic\", because that would lose the meaning of his message.\n\nOn 24 August, Breivik was found to be sane by the panel of five judges. He was sentenced to preventative detention (forvaring), a sentence of 21 years in prison which can be repeatedly extended by 5 years as long as he is considered a threat to society. This is the maximum sentence allowed by Norwegian law, and it is the only way to allow for life imprisonment.\n\n==After-effects==\n\n===In Norway===\nCoop Norway, a chain of retail stores in Norway, removed several games from its shelves as a result of the attack. Some of the titles includes games like Homefront, Call of Duty series, Sniper Ghost Warrior, Counter-Strike Source and World of Warcraft. Some games were also temporarily removed from the Norwegian WiiWare catalog, including an on-rails shooter game.\n\nIn the days following the attacks, Norway's largest represented political parties noted a significant increase in interest for membership from young people. Both the Norwegian Young Conservatives and the Progress Party's Youth, as well as the Workers' Youth League (AUF) had signed up a significant number of new members after a few days. The mother parties also reported an unusual increase in new member applications, with the Conservative Party and the Progress Party having signed up almost 1,000 new members each by early August, while the Labour Party reported over 6,000 new members at the end of the month.\n\nFar-right groups such as Stop the Islamisation of Norway (SIAN) and the Norwegian Defence League (NDL), as well as the Democrats, had reportedly witnessed a boom in their memberships and interest by mid-August, with the Democrats party having signed up around one hundred new members, and the NDL around three hundred.\n\nIn the September local elections almost two months after the attacks, gains were made by the Conservative Party (up 9% to 28%), and to a lesser extent the Labour Party (up 2% to 32%). On the other hand, setbacks were witnessed by the Progress Party, the party Breivik had been a member of, (down 6% to 11%) and the Socialist Left Party (down 2% to 4%).\n\nIn the Gj\u00f8rv Report, received by the prime minister in advance of a press conference on 13 August 2012, it was concluded that more actions could have been taken by authorities, to stop Breivik, to track him, or to interrupt his attacks. It also criticised the police action, in stark contrast to an internal report issued by the police earlier. A few days later, national police chief \u00d8ystein M\u00e6land submitted his resignation, citing a lack of clear support for his position from his superiors and saying: \"If the [justice] ministry and other political authorities do not clarify this matter unequivocally, it will become impossible for me to continue.\" His resignation was accepted and announced by Justice Minister Grete Faremo.\n\nVegard Groeslie Wennesland, a survivor of the incident, ran for parliament on a Labour Party ticket in the 2013 Norwegian parliamentary election which brought a coalition government of the Conservative party and the right-wing Progress Party, of which Breivik had been a member from 1999 until 2004, to power.\n\nIn 2013 former AUF local leader and Labour Party cabinet advisor Ivar Fjeld released the pamphlet Den r\u00f8dgr\u00f8nne terror\u00f8ya (\"The Red-Green Terror Island\"), which documented how Ut\u00f8ya over several years had been used to build up support for anti-Israel politics and Palestinian terrorists. In the book he documents among other things that AUF had allowed far-left Red Youth to arrange camps on Ut\u00f8ya, who collected money for and welcomed representatives from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) on the island. Fjeld claimed that his purpose with the book was to warn the Labour Party about the activities of its increasingly radicalised and Islamised youth organisation.\n\n===Czech copycat===\n\n\nOn 10 August 2012, the Rapid Reaction Unit (URNA) of the Czech Police, backed up by a local SWAT unit and over 100 other policemen, arrested a 29-year-old admirer of Breivik, Vojt\u011bch Ml\u00fdnek, in Ostrava, the Czech Republic's third largest city. The police suspected that Ml\u00fdnek was preparing a copycat attack inspired by the 2011 Norway attacks. He was stockpiling weapons (including a fully automatic assault rifle and armor-piercing bullets) and had converted an aerial bomb in order to be able to remotely detonate it. Ml\u00fdnek had the remote control with him while arrested. He had also obtained uniforms of the Czech police and of the Czech prison service and a police ID.\n\nMl\u00fdnek, who was using the pseudonym Anders Behring Breivik in electronic communication, has had a history of four prior criminal convictions, including a six-month-long suspended sentence for setting off an explosive which demolished an empty wooden cottage.\n\nMl\u00fdnek was initially charged with endangering public and with illegal arming, which carried a penalty from three to eight years in prison. He was first held in a remand prison, but was transferred to an isolation unit of prison hospital in Brno following a psychiatric evaluation. On 3 April 2013, a court in Ostrava found Ml\u00fdnek criminally insane. At the same time he was found dangerous to the public and ordered psychiatric detention. The reasons for detention will be reviewed by the court periodically every two years. Police determined that Ml\u00fdnek, despite being a Breivik sympathizer, was not preparing an actual terrorist attack; however, he suffered from paranoia and was stockpiling the weapons and bombs with the aim of self-defense.\n\n===Polish copycat===\n\nOn 20 November 2012 the Polish authorities announced the arrest of a 45-year-old lecturer in chemical engineering at the Agricultural University of Cracow under suspicion of preparing a similar attack. According to the authorities,  was an admirer of Breivik and was further inspired by the Oklahoma City bombing.\n\nPoland's Internal Security Agency (ABW) first found out about Kwiecie\u0144 after it launched investigation into Breivik's Polish contacts when it became known that Breivik had ordered some of the chemicals for his bomb from Poland via internet. According to ABW, Kwiecie\u0144 was preparing an attack against the Sejm, the lower house of the Polish parliament. He wanted to detonate  of explosives in a car bomb parked at the building during deliberation of the next year's budget, as it is the time when all the members of parliament, the Prime Minister as well as the President are all present in the building.\n\nKwiecie\u0144 tried to arm himself already in 1997, however the authorities refused his application for a firearm permit. He later started arming himself illegally, mostly with weapons bought in Belgium. He bought firearms, ammunition, bulletproof vests with ceramic plates and kevlar helmets. He had visited the Sejm and tested whether it is possible to use radio remote controls in the buildings for the purposes of planned detonation of the car bomb. Being a graduate of Warsaw University of Technology program on explosive manufacturing, Kwiecie\u0144 was conducting illegal trials of explosives from at least 2000. In some cases, he detonated small explosives on Warsaw bridges, making small dents and holes in their construction. Apart from targeting the parliament, Kwiecie\u0144 was also preparing murders of Monika Olejnik, an influential journalist, and Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, the mayor of Warsaw.\n\nKwiecie\u0144 intensified his preparations after Breivik's conviction. He conducted an experimental explosion of a  bomb in the Polish countryside in the municipality of Przeginia, which he also filmed. He had recruited four other people for his cause, however at least two of them were actually ABW's secret agents. He was convicted and sentenced to nine years of imprisonment on 19 April 2017. Brunon Kwiecie\u0144 died in prison on 6 August 2019 from what is believed to have been a suicide.\n\n===Embezzlement from terror attack victims fund===\nIn 2016, one person was sentenced to 120 days in prison for embezzling 300,000 Norwegian kroner from St\u00f8ttegruppen etter 22. juli, a Norwegian NGO; the money was supposed to have gone to victims of the terror attack. The perpetrator was a steward of the NGO.\n\n===Semi-automatic weapon ban for hunting and Mini-14 rifle ban===\nOn 28 February 2018, Peter Froelich of the Norwegian parliament's committee on judicial affairs, said a proposal to ban semi-automatic weapons proposed the year prior now had enough political support to become law by 2021. The law will ban Ruger Mini-14 rifle that was used in Ut\u00f8ya massacre and other semi-auto rifles for hunting. However, using semi-automatic firearms for shooting sports is still legal for sportsmen who have permission for practice and competition shooting from Dynamic Sports Shooting Norway (DSSN) or the Norwegian Reserve Officers' Association (NROF).\n\n===Christchurch mosque shootings===\n\nBrenton Harrison Tarrant, the perpetrator of two consecutive mass shootings at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, said in his manifesto The Great Replacement (in reference to a far-right theory from France by Renaud Camus) that he was in particular inspired by Breivik and claimed to have been in \"brief contact\" with him, as well as meeting with his organisation, the Knights Templar. The shootings took place at Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, during Friday Prayer on 15 March 2019, killing 51 people and injuring 49 more.\n\n==In popular culture==\n===Films===\nTwo films about the attacks were released in 2018: the Norwegian production Ut\u00f8ya: July 22, directed by Erik Poppe in Norwegian language and released in February, and the American production 22 July, directed by English filmmaker Paul Greengrass in English language (but with a Norwegian cast) and released in September. Despite their similar names and close release dates, they are unrelated.\n\nPoppe's film is a continuous shot feature film reenacting the Ut\u00f8ya massacre by focusing solely on the victims (particularly on one played by Andrea Berntzen), with Breivik only appearing briefly as a distant shadowy figure. All the characters are fictional, and the movie was filmed as one continuous take, as the purpose was to promote understanding of the victims as seen from their perspective.\n\nGreengrass' film is based on the non-fiction book One of Us: The Story of a Massacre in Norway \u2013 and Its Aftermath, and unlike Poppe's work depicts real-life individuals involved in the events, with Breivik (played by Anders Danielsen Lie) playing a central role. The movie depicts both attacks, while also focusing heavily on their aftermath, most notably Breivik's trial; in parallel, it also focuses on the story of Viljar Hanssen, one of the survivors of the Ut\u00f8ya massacre who was shot and barely survived, as he and his family try to cope with the trauma.\n\nBoth films were received positively by critics, with several media outlets studying their radically different approaches to the same subject.\n\n===Music===\nThe Austrian black metal band Harakiri for the Sky released a song titled, \"69 Dead Birds for Ut\u00f8ya\", on their 2014 album Aokigahara. One verse says: \"Everytime you think the most stupefying incident in this world already happened, There comes one more.\"\n\nDutch symphonic metal band Epica released a song entitled \"Internal Warfare\", on their 2012 album Requiem for the Indifferent. Singer Simone Simons stated in an interview that it was about the Anders Breivik attacks in Norway.\n\nA 2016 song performed by the Norwegian pop-rock band deLillos, \"Vi ser dere n\u00e5\" (\"We see you now\"), was written about the attacks; one verse says: \".. he set off a bomb, to go to an island, where he gunned down youth, as if it was fun\".\n\nEric Brazilian wrote and performed the hopeful song \"One Light\" in honor of the people of Norway after the tragedy. August 18, 2011. Video produced by Feedback. View on YouTube.\n\n===Television===\nSeason 6 of Seconds From Disaster premiered on the one-year anniversary of the 2011 Norway attacks (aired 22 July 2012), with the episode titled, \"Norway Massacre: I Was There\".\n\nThe Futurama episode The Cryonic Woman was briefly changed on some syndicated reruns, including the DVD re-release, because a moment in the episode included a screen saying \"Prime Minister of Norway\". This was later changed to \"Chainsaw Juggler\".\n\n==See also==\n* 22 July Information Center, the government enquiry into the attacks\n* Anders Behring Breivik in popular culture\n* Oklahoma City bombing, a lone wolf attack against government offices Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA, using similar explosives.\n* List of rampage killers (religious, political or racial crimes)\n\n==References==\n\n\n==Further reading==\n* Borchgrevink, Aage Storm, and Guy Puzey.

{"title":"2011 Fuzhou, Jiangxi bombings","article":"The 2011 Fuzhou bombings were three separate, synchronized explosions at government buildings in Fuzhou, Jiangxi, China on the morning of 26 May 2011. At least three people died, and at least seven were injured. The perpetrator, 52-year-old Qian Mingqi, was initially reported possibly among those killed in the blasts, leading China's state run news agencies to label it a suicide bombing. The Jiangxi Provincial Public Security Department later confirmed that the suspect died at the scene.\n\nThe three explosions occurred between 9:18 and 9:45am CST (0100 UTC). The first blast occurred in a parking lot outside the offices of the city prosecutor, the second inside a district administration office, and the third explosion hit the city's food and drug agency. Two of the bombs were placed inside cars parked just outside the buildings. The official Xinhua news agency had posted a news article on its website saying the bombs were planted by a disgruntled farmer who was dissatisfied with the outcome of a court case, but by 1pm on the day of the bombing the article had been removed from the site.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1995 Qian Mingqi's home was demolished by government authorities to make way for a highway.  He then saved up enough money to build a second home, which was also shattered by a second forced demolition.  His second house cost about 500,000 yuan, and the authorities paid him only half of that for compensation. Because of the lack of compensation, he posted slogans to resist the demolition.  According to his neighbors, Qian's wife was then hung upside down by the demolition team.  She died a few years later from gall bladder disease.  From the police report of the Fuzhou Police, Qian's wife has been dead for several years.\n\nAfter the ordeal he then discovered the land seized from him to make a highway was actually not used. By 2002 Qian began petitioning in Fuzhou and Beijing's government offices. Unable to find redress, he reportedly taught himself to use the internet, and cultivate a presence on various blogging platforms, hoping to get the attention of human rights defenders, academics, lawyers, reporters, and police. Not only did Qian fail to elicit the attention of anyone who might help him, but he became aware of other individuals who had similarly had their homes demolished. In one of his blog he accused Linchuan district party cadre of embezzling 10 million yuan in compensation funds after demolishing his house and that of seven other families. Qian had two sons and one daughter.\n\nBombings, especially ones of this sophistication, are rare in China, but this was the second in a month. Earlier in May 2011 in north-west Gansu province a \"petrol bomb\" was set off outside a bank by a former employee. There are very few ways for the Chinese people to redress or raise awareness of what they see as a wrong they have suffered, and therefore, as the BBC's Michael Bristow states, \"some Chinese people occasionally take out their frustration in attacks like this.\"\n\n==Incident==\nAccording to Mingqi's Sina Weibo site and the 2002 demolitions, Qian was fed up. The weibo posts state \"Ten years of seeking redress resulted in nothing,\" and \"I was forced to step onto a road I didn't want to step on due to the loss of my newly built house, which was illegally demolished...my total loss was near to RMB two million Yuan.\"\n who wrote on Sina.com's weibo (microblogging) service, Sina Weibo, that his home had been demolished illegally.\nHe wrote the last statement in his weibo: \"I want to learn from Dong Cunrui [a People's Liberation Army soldier who carried an explosive package and blew up a bunker in 1948] and I hope I can receive the public's support and attention.\"\n\nThe bombs were detonated by Qian Mingqi, aged 52 at the time, who was killed in the explosions. Two victims are security guards of the Linchuan district government building, Xu Yingfu and\nHe Haigen.\n\nTime magazine reported:\n\"The first bomb, in a vehicle parked inside the gate of the local prosecutor's office, went off at about 9:15 a.m., according to local media reports. A second bomb detonated at 9:30 a.m. at a district government office, and a third bomb, believed to be a car bomb like the first, went off at 9:45 a.m. outside a local office of the State Food and Drug Administration.\"\n\nThe explosion blew most of the windows out of the local prosecutor's office, an eight-story building, and at least ten cars were destroyed.\n\n==Censorship==\n\nLocal journalists in Fuzhou stated that the Chinese police confiscated record-taking materials and deleted photographs from cameras. An early report posted on the official Xinhua News site was later removed from the website. Officials from the city were supposed to hold a news conference about the bombings, but it was canceled at the last minute, leading to further accusations of censorship.\n\n==Response==\nMany Chinese bloggers, weibo and Twitter users expressed sympathy for Qian Mingqi, with some calling him a \"hero\", and comparing him to Yang Jia, who killed Shanghai policemen after allegedly suffering mistreatment. Following the bombings, Qian's weibo page had attracted some 30,000 followers, before being shut down by Sina administrators. The Christian Science Monitor reported that most of the online commentators regarded Qian's actions not as a terrorist attack, but as  \"righteous vengeance:\"  \"The flood of supportive comments online since his death is a sign of widespread public frustration at the government's disdain for ordinary citizens.\" VOA reported on 27 May that the death of Qian has sounded an alarm bell for Chinese government, and one blogger has said on his Twitter account:\"...history will always remember Qian.\"\n\nIn an interview, Li Chengpeng, one of China's most popular and influential bloggers, said \"Qian was no Bin Laden, he was one of the weak, he had no way to express himself nor defend his rights.\"\n\nThe Associated Press explained the outpouring of sympathy for Qian by observing that many citizens could relate to his tale of victimization at the hands of authorities, and to his frustration at the lack of channels to seek redress. The Associated Press observed that \"Qian's grievances resonate widely in China, where land disputes have mushroomed amid a fast-paced economic boom. Standoffs between tenants and developers often turn violent, with homeowners beaten by thugs or even crushed by bulldozers. Other tenants have set themselves on fire rather than face eviction.\"\n\nThe state-run Global Times newspaper issued a report after the bombings calling for a condemnation of the violence, but also proposed that more needed to be done to understand why individuals like Qian are occasionally driven to lash out. The article quoted Mao Shoulong, a professor of public policy at Renmin University of China, saying that while extreme actions to seek redress should not be encouraged in any way, \"At the same time, authorities should learn to open smoother channels for the public to file their complaints before problems turn into confrontations and then violence.\"\n\n\"Despite enormous attention being paid to the cause of the attack, we must lament the deaths of innocent people whose families and friends are now suffering...This horrendous act, no matter its origin, deserves the most vehement condemnation,\" the author said in one article with title \"Horrendous attacks deserve public condemnation\" in the observer column of the Global Times.\n\n==See also==\n*2010 Austin plane crash\n*Social issues in the People's Republic of China\n*Suicide in the People's Republic of China\n*Socialist Harmonious Society\n*Terrorism in the People's Republic of China\n*Deng Yujiao incident\n*Weiquan movement\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n* Perpetrator's account at Sina Weibo","urls":["https:\/\/www.thestar.com\/news\/world\/article\/997238--three-dead-in-chinese-bombings","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2011\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/05\/26\/china.blast\/index.html?hpt=T2","http:\/\/ibnlive.in.com\/news\/china-serial-blasts-rare-case-of-suicide-bombing\/154784-2.html","http:\/\/china.globaltimes.cn\/society\/2011-05\/659581.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20120312231552\/http:\/\/china.globaltimes.cn\/society\/2011-05\/659581.html","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-asia-pacific-13556366","https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/worldnews\/asia\/china\/8537228\/Three-Chinese-government-buildings-bombed.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/05\/27\/world\/asia\/27china.html","http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/portal\/site\/SCMP\/menuitem.2af62ecb329d3d7733492d9253a0a0a0\/?vgnextoid=a9290fe4b5230310VgnVCM100000360a0a0aRCRD&ss=China&s=News","http:\/\/www.zaobao.com\/wencui\/2011\/05\/taiwan110528.shtml","http:\/\/shanghaiist.com\/2011\/05\/27\/jiangxi-bomber-qian-mingqi.php","http:\/\/news.dayoo.com\/china\/201105\/27\/53868_16956189.htm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110530173558\/http:\/\/news.dayoo.com\/china\/201105\/27\/53868_16956189.htm","http:\/\/ibnlive.in.com\/news\/china-serial-blasts-rare-case-of-suicide-bombing\/154784-2.html","http:\/\/news.qq.com\/a\/20110527\/000492.htm","http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/news\/international\/article2051657.ece","http:\/\/www.asianews.it\/news-en\/Qian-Mingqi-blew-himself-up-to-demand-justice-and-call-attention-to-his-plight-21688.html","http:\/\/www.dfdaily.com\/html\/33\/2011\/5\/29\/610731.shtml","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110602194817\/http:\/\/www.dfdaily.com\/html\/33\/2011\/5\/29\/610731.shtml","http:\/\/globalspin.blogs.time.com\/2011\/05\/26\/chinese-city-shaken-by-multiple-bomb-blasts\/","http:\/\/www.bostonherald.com\/news\/international\/asia_pacific\/view.bg?&articleid=1340988&format=&page=1&listingType=intasia","http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/World\/Asia-Pacific\/2011\/0527\/Chinese-bomber-receives-outpouring-of-sympathy-online","http:\/\/www.voafanti.com\/gate\/big5\/www.voanews.com\/chinese\/news\/20110527-Jiangxi-Blast-122711704.html?commentSubmitted=y&field=","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20111002094123\/http:\/\/www.voafanti.com\/gate\/big5\/www.voanews.com\/chinese\/news\/20110527-Jiangxi-Blast-122711704.html?commentSubmitted=y&field=","http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/World\/Asia-Pacific\/2011\/0527\/Chinese-bomber-receives-outpouring-of-sympathy-online","http:\/\/www.bostonherald.com\/news\/international\/asia_pacific\/view.bg?&articleid=1340988&format=&page=1&listingType=intasia","http:\/\/china.globaltimes.cn\/society\/2011-05\/659581.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20120312231552\/http:\/\/china.globaltimes.cn\/society\/2011-05\/659581.html","http:\/\/opinion.globaltimes.cn\/observer\/2011-05\/659546.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110720164328\/http:\/\/opinion.globaltimes.cn\/observer\/2011-05\/659546.html"]}
{"title":"2011 Charsadda bombing","article":"A double bombing occurred on 13 May 2011 in Shabqadar Fort in Charsadda District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. 98 people were killed when two suicide bombs exploded in the Frontier Constabulary training centre. At least 140 others were injured. The explosions occurred while cadets were getting into buses for a ten-day leave after a training course.\n\n==Background==\nIt was the deadliest attack in Pakistan since the death of al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden; the death of bin Laden had led Ahmed Akhtar to speculate that Pakistan would receive retaliatory acts of violence for its supposed participation in the al-Qaeda leader's death. The Frontier constabulary is a paramilitary force of about 70,000 men who provide security to foreign embassies in major cities and man checkpoints in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It was established in the 1800s and is run by the Pakistani police. For men of many poor families joining the constabulary is a coveted ambition.\n\n==Bombing==\nThe bomber was outside the training academy when he exploded his car at about 6\u00a0am local time. Most of those killed were men waiting to go home after completing 6 months of training. Mohammad Sardar, who was wounded in the head and admitted to the Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar, said: \"There are two occasions in one\u2019s life to celebrate: wedding and going home on vacations at the end of six months of training. So we were all happy, celebrating the occasion, with bedrolls on our heads, thinking of home, when the first explosion occurred, followed by a second.\"\n\n==Responsibility==\nThe Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan officially claimed responsibility for the bombing, saying the attack was in revenge for bin Laden's death. \"This was the first revenge for Osama\u2019s martyrdom. Wait for bigger attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan.\" However, some local officials doubted the attack was carried out in revenge for bin Laden, saying the attack may have possibly been conducted by a splinter group of the Taliban as a reaction to the Pakistani Army's latest assault against Taliban militants in the Mohmand region along Afghanistan.\n\n==Reactions==\nIn financial markets, the yen rose following the attack on concern of increased instability and as the yen is generally considered a stable refuge.\n\n Within Pakistan, the attack was condemned by the President, Prime Minister and other political figures. MQM chief Altaf Hussain expressed sorrow and regret over the loss of lives. The Chief Minister of Sindh Syed Qaim Ali Shah also expressed his sympathy.\n\n In a telephone conversation with Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani, British Prime Minister David Cameron expressed his condolences over the attack, assured his support to Pakistan and said that the United Kingdom knew well Islamabad was facing political turmoil, which was heavily taking a toll on its men and material.\n\nGillani stated: \"Pakistan is committed to working with the rest of the world to eradicate terrorism. It will also take care of its national interests.\"\n\n The United States embassy in Pakistan condemned the attack. \"We extend our condolences to the Pakistan Armed Forces, and families and friends of the victims. Terrorists have shown time and again that they are the true enemy of the people and government of Pakistan,\" a statement from the embassy said.\n\n==See also==\n* List of terrorist incidents in Pakistan since 2001\n* War in North-West Pakistan\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n*  In pictures: Pakistan bomb attacks, BBC\n*  Frontier constabulary centre Shabqadar","urls":["https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-south-asia-13385597","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110513035733\/http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-south-asia-13385597","http:\/\/tribune.com.pk\/story\/167870\/bombs-targets-army-recruits-in-charsadda70-dead\/","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2011\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/05\/12\/pakistan.explosions\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110513062924\/http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2011\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/05\/12\/pakistan.explosions\/","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2011\/may\/13\/pakistan-paramilitary-base-bombings","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110513040501\/http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2011\/may\/13\/pakistan-paramilitary-base-bombings","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/05\/14\/world\/asia\/14bomb.html","https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/2011-05-13\/yen-rises-as-losses-in-stocks-commodities-raise-investor-demand-for-haven.html","http:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=46841&Cat=4&dt=13","http:\/\/tribune.com.pk\/story\/169633\/sovereignty-uppermost-gilani-tells-cameron\/","http:\/\/nation.com.pk\/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online\/Regional\/Islamabad\/14-May-2011\/US-flays-Charsadda-attack","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110518142759\/http:\/\/nation.com.pk\/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online\/Regional\/Islamabad\/14-May-2011\/US-flays-Charsadda-attack"]}

{"title":"2011 Faisalabad bombing","article":"The 2011 Faisalabad bombing occurred on 8 March 2011.  At least 25 people were killed and over 127 wounded when a car bomb blast occurred in a compressed natural gas station in the Pakistani city of Faisalabad.  The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan claimed responsibility for the explosion.\n\n== Background ==\nFaisalabad is the fourth-largest city in the country and an important industrial hub of the Punjab province; the attack was the first of its kind in the area, which usually remained safe from terrorist incidents. Faisalabad is the home of Pakistani textile industry.  Pro-Taliban militant groups had been gaining strength in the area, which had previously witnessed sectarian violence.\n\n== Attack ==\nThe car bomb went off at about 10:30\u00a0am and left a 7-foot deep by 15-foot wide crater. According to local officials a Toyota Corolla packed with 40 kilograms of explosives was used in the attack.\n\nThe vicinity in which the attack took place was said to be a sensitive area and surrounded by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and military offices. A Pakistan International Airlines building and an ISI building were damaged in the bombing.

{"title":"December 2010 Mohmand Agency bombings","article":"The December 2010 Mohmand Agency bombings took place on 6 December 2010 after two suicide bombers targeted a government compound in Ghalanai, the main town and capital of the Mohmand Agency located in Pakistan's tribal areas along the Afghan border. At least 50 people were killed and more than 100 others injured. The target of the attacks was a jirga (meeting) convened by government officials, local tribal elders and anti-Taliban groups. According to witnesses, an undisclosed number of tribal citizens, police officers and at least two journalists were amongst those killed. Eyewitnesses claimed that a deafening sound occurred followed by clouds of dust and smoke, with dozens of people on the ground, who were bleeding and crying, with reports of body parts scattered within the compound. A local administration later confirmed to the media that a suicide bomber on a motorbike had detonated his explosives, after he had driven up to a sitting area at the meeting. Whereas the second suicide attacker, also on a motorcycle had detonated his explosive device at the gate to this government compound. It was reported that both bombers were disguised in police uniforms. A possible target for these suicide attacks was Mohmand's top political official, Amjad Ali Khan, who was not killed or injured in the attacks. Khan later confirmed that the suicide bombers had packed their suicide vests with ball-bearings, thus increasing the number of casualties. It was reported that about 25 people of whom were seriously injured in the suicide attacks were taken for treatment to the Lady Reading Hospital in the nearby city and provincial capital\nof Peshawar.\n\nThe Taliban accepted responsibility for perpetrating the attacks hours later through a spokesman, threatening more attacks on anyone forming lashkars (armed militias) and committees against them.\nMohmand Agency is a known stronghold for militant groups and has been the site of periodic violence before. Despite the Pakistan Army's claims of successful military offensives in the region, analysts have appeared sceptical and say the insurgents are often able to escape, undisrupted.\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-south-asia-11924584","http:\/\/tribune.com.pk\/story\/86562\/explosion-in-mohmand-kills-8\/"]}
{"title":"Pakistan CID building attack","article":"The CID building attack was the result of a car bomb in Karachi, Pakistan, which occurred on 11 November 2010. Initial reports indicated the building housing the CID had collapsed and blast crater of 5 metres was discovered in close proximity. At least 18 people were killed and 100 injured, though casualty figures were expected to rise. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan claimed responsibility for the attack through Azam Tariq, their spokesman. However, the involvement of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi was also contested with interior minister Rehman Malik appearing sure of the possibility.\n\n== Attack ==\nThe attack was coordinated on the headquarters of Pakistan's Criminal Investigation Department (C.I.D), a department responsible for anti-terrorism operations, in what is described as the city's \"highest security zone\" \u2013 just metres away from the house of the provincial Chief Minister of Sindh and two five-star hotels. According to Tariq, the attack was carried out in retaliation for the continued drone attacks in northwest Pakistan. Authorities reported that five to six people were seen throwing grenades and firing at the gate of the building, consequently killing the guards posted there; moments later, a vehicle packed with explosives made its way inside and exploded just metres away from the building, causing damage and destruction to nearby structures as well. Additionally, other witnesses reported that prior to the blast, a gunfight had taken place between heavily armed militants and security forces; a local resident remarked that this firing continued for 20 minutes before the explosion had occurred.\n\n==See also==\n* List of terrorist incidents, 2010\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.google.com\/hostednews\/afp\/article\/ALeqM5jRWtvK3xtiiUPlAODA6GVUXYCbDQ?docId=CNG.7be67c6661b96ad558b4f87bfdc104e5.9b1","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-south-asia-11737402","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2010\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/11\/11\/pakistan.blast\/?hpt=T1","http:\/\/tribune.com.pk\/story\/76600\/smart-money-on-the-ttp-but-lej-strongly-suspected\/","http:\/\/tribune.com.pk\/story\/76097\/karachi-blast-an-audacious-reprisal\/"]}

The attack was in front of the local sales office of Asiacell (an Iraqi mobile phone company), although it is not clear if this was the specific target.\n\nMinutes later, a second attack occurred, in the predominantly Shia neighborhood of Al Kadhimiyah.

The first attack in the morning was when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives outside the Iraqi Army division headquarters on potential recruits to the army, some of whom had queued for hours prior to the bombings, that killed over 60 and wounded more than 100. The second attack took place in the evening when a fuel truck exploded in a Shia neighbourhood, killing 8 and wounding 44.Islamic State of Iraq claimed the first of the two attacks.\n\n==Background==\nThe bombing came amid uncertainty over the future government in Iraq following the 2010 Iraqi parliamentary election. One day before the attack former Iraqi Interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi pulled out of coalition talks with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki following claims that al-Maliki was pushing for a sectarian division of government.\n\nSecurity forces have been targets of attack in the months prior to this bombing. The United States began to reduce its troop strength in Iraq, from just under 60,000 at the time of this bombing, to about 50,000 by 31 August, which was scheduled to be the formal end of combat operations.\n\nThe bombing was the first major attack of the year's Ramadan, the most venerated month in the Islamic calendar.\n\n==Bombings==\n===First bombing===\nUnemployed people had queued for hours outside an Army recruiting centre when a suicide bomber approached and detonated his explosives.

But they are firmly on track. And we're confident that we're moving toward the end of our combat mission.

It was also the deadliest day in the country until the attacks on 23 July 2012, which killed 116 people.\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the inconclusive 2010 Iraqi elections, these attacks were believed to be an attempt to further destabilise Iraq. Major General Qassim al-Moussawi, an Iraqi Army spokesman, gave a statement on 10 May in which he said \"Al-Qaeda is trying to\u00a0... use some gaps created by some political problems\".\n\nAccording to official statistics, violent deaths in Iraq decreased slightly in April 2010 compared with April 2009.\n\n==Attacks==\nThere were at least twenty attacks, of which the worst, by death toll, was a series of three to four suicide car bombs at the 'State Company for Textile Industries' in Al Hillah in central Iraq, approximately  from the capital, Baghdad. The first two bombs were in quick succession at about  (10:30 UTC), followed minutes later by a third. A fourth car bomb targeted the crowd and emergency services at the scene, according to police Captain Ali al-Shimmari. The bombs killed a total of 45 people, leaving 140 wounded.\n\nFallujah, which had previously seen intense battles between insurgents and American troops was targeted with at least two deaths resulting from bomb blasts.

{"title":"April 2010 Baghdad bombings","article":"The April 2010 Baghdad bombings were a series of bomb attacks in Baghdad, Iraq that killed at least 85 people over two days. Hundreds more were seriously wounded.\n\n==The bombings==\n===23 April attacks===\nOn 23 April, over a two-hour time span, a wave of coordinated bombings hit Shia Muslims leaving Friday prayers, Shiite neighbourhoods, and a market. The attacks consisted of five car bombs, which accounted for 58 deaths, and approximately 13 bombs in total. A car bomb outside the Abdel Hadi al-Chalabi mosque in Al-Hurriya killed five and wounded 14. Three bombs, including two car bombs, in the Sadr City district of Baghdad occurred near the headquarters of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, where followers gather for morning prayers every Friday. The bombings killed at least 39 and wounded 56 others in Sadr City. A car bomb and a suicide bomber in the Al-Ameen district in east Baghdad killed 11 worshipers leaving a Shiite mosque after prayers and wounded 23 additional people. \"Why do they always target us? We are peaceful people. We come to pray and then go on our way,\" remarked one angry survivor.\n\nFive homemade bombs were also detonated in the predominantly Sunni Al Anbar Governorate killing seven and injuring 11. A police officer responding to the bombings was killed by a roadside bomb. A cluster of houses was damaged in the attack. According to NPR correspondent Quill Lawrence, the bombs were targeted at a police detective and a judge living in the area, both of whom survived.  Late on 24 April, the official death toll from the Friday attacks stood at 72. Around 120 people were wounded.\n\n===Continued violence===\nOn 24 April, 13 additional people were killed when three bombs were detonated in Western Baghdad.  The three bombs, which were hidden in plastic bags, injured 25 additional people. The three bombs exploded simultaneously in a billiard hall located in a mixed Sunni-Shiite neighbourhood.\n\n==Perpetrators and aftermath==\nPrime minister Nouri al-Maliki and other officials have blamed Al-Qaeda in Iraq for the bombing attacks.  The attacks were widely seen as retribution for the killings of two top Al-Qaeda officials the previous Sunday.  Security spokesperson Qassim al-Moussawi stated that \"targeting prayers in areas with a [Shiite] majority is a revenge for the losses suffered by al Qaeda.\" Iraqi political analyst Hameed Fadhel agreed, saying, \"These are acts of revenge that are intended to send a message to the Iraqi government and the world that al-Qaida's existence will not be affected by the killing of specific leaders.\" No one has officially claimed responsibility.  The government expects \"such terrorist acts to continue.\"\n\nAfter the attacks, Muqtada al-Sadr offered to \"Iraqi security forces to fight insurgents\", sparking fear that he might be considering a revival of his Mahdi Army militia. Al-Sadr's aides claimed that he had no such plans.  He urged his followers to remain calm and not provoke the United States, but added that he was prepared to have \"hundreds of believers\" join the Iraqi army and police forces. \"The government might ask the help of individual citizens, not from armed groups,\" presidential aid Ali al-Adeeb responded.\n\nOn Friday and Saturday, citizens of the Sadr City enclave of Baghdad took to the streets for at least six separate funeral processions.  Many of the victims were carried to the holy city of Najaf, 100 miles (160 kilometers) to the south.  Some of the mourners supported the idea of reviving the Mahdi Army. \"They can provide security. The government cannot,\" remarked one citizen.\n\n==See also==\n\n* List of terrorist incidents, 2010\n* Terrorist incidents in Iraq in 2010\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/middle_east\/8639223.stm","http:\/\/www.timesonline.co.uk\/tol\/news\/world\/iraq\/article7106632.ece","https:\/\/www.google.com\/hostednews\/ap\/article\/ALeqM5hwK_CSpBxsNuVUEaDuOwmSSCiqGwD9F8SPU80","https:\/\/vancouversun.com\/news\/Bombings+leave+people+dead+Iraqi+capital\/2946471\/story.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20191215065808\/https:\/\/vancouversun.com\/news\/Bombings+leave+people+dead+Iraqi+capital\/2946471\/story.html","http:\/\/seattletimes.nwsource.com\/html\/nationworld\/2011689081_iraq24.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110622021052\/http:\/\/seattletimes.nwsource.com\/html\/nationworld\/2011689081_iraq24.html","http:\/\/www.smh.com.au\/world\/five-car-bombs-kill-58-20100424-tkin.html","https:\/\/www.npr.org\/blogs\/thetwo-way\/2010\/04\/iraq_bombings_kill_at_least_56.html","https:\/\/www.google.com\/hostednews\/ap\/article\/ALeqM5hwK_CSpBxsNuVUEaDuOwmSSCiqGwD9F9KSR80","https:\/\/www.google.com\/hostednews\/ap\/article\/ALeqM5hwK_CSpBxsNuVUEaDuOwmSSCiqGwD9F9NSB00","https:\/\/www.google.com\/hostednews\/ap\/article\/ALeqM5hwK_CSpBxsNuVUEaDuOwmSSCiqGwD9F99SDO0"]}

{"title":"May 2010 Kabul bombing","article":"The May 2010 Kabul bombing occurred on May 18, 2010, in Kabul, Afghanistan. Eighteen people including five US soldiers and a Canadian soldier were killed and fifty-two were injured when a NATO convoy was targeted by a Taliban suicide attacker. It was the deadliest attack against NATO forces in Afghanistan since September 2009 when six Italian soldiers were killed by a suicide bomber. Two full colonels and two lieutenant colonels were killed in this attack making it the deadliest attack against ranking officers in Afghanistan. With this attack the total number of Americans killed in Afghanistan crossed one thousand.\n\n==Background==\nPresident Hamid Karzai had recently returned from a trip to US to gather support for his policy to promote peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan. A jirga was planned to discuss methods to promote peace with the tribal elders.  Also a military offensive was being planned in the Kandahar Province.  Shortly before this attack Taliban had announced 'Operation al-Fatah' that would target NATO forces, foreign diplomats, contractors and Afghan government.  Afghan police had set up several extra security checkpoints this year. In spite of these measures the bomber was able to drive his vehicle into the city.\n\n==Attack==\n\n\nThe bomber, driving a Toyota minivan packed with more than 1600 pounds of explosives, drove into a convoy of American military vehicles moving down the Dar-ul-Aman road at about  local time and exploded. The blast created a deep crater in the road near the ruined Darul Aman Palace. The bombing happened during the rush hour close to the National Assembly of Afghanistan.  The blast destroyed 5 US military vehicles and 13 civilian vehicles.  Most of the dead were Afghan civilians including women and children in a public bus which was driving by when the  explosion happened.  Five US soldiers were among the dead.  The dead Canadian soldier was identified as Colonel Geoff Parker originally from Oakville, Ontario.  He is the highest-ranked Canadian soldier killed in Afghanistan.  An American colonel, 2 American lieutenant colonels, 1 Staff Sergeant and 1 Sergeant.  The American officers were identified as colonel John M. McHugh, 46, from New Jersey and lieutenant colonels, Paul R. Bartz, 43, of Waterloo, Wisconsin, and Thomas P. Belkofer, 44, of Perrysburg, Ohio. Staff Sergeant Richard J. Tieman of Waynesboro PA and Sergeant Joshua Tomlinson of Dubberly LA were also killed.\n\n==Responsibility==\nThe Taliban took responsibility for the attack. They stated that they had sent a man named Nizamuddin to carry out the attack. Several analysts believe that the attack reflected Taliban opposition to the upcoming peace jirga proposed by President Hamid Karzai. According to Afghanistan's spy agency the attack was allegedly carried out by Pakistan' spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence.  Saeed Ansari a spokesman for National Directorate of Security, Afghanistan\u2019s spy agency stated that 'All the explosions and terrorist attacks by these people were plotted from the other side of the border and most of the explosives and materials used for the attacks were brought from the other side to Afghanistan.' According to US military intelligence officials Haqqani network based in Pakistan was also involved in the attack.\n\n==Reactions==\nThe attack drew strong condemnation from Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Secretary General of NATO. Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada in a statement condemned the attack and mourned Parker calling him a \"great Canadian who will be greatly missed by the Canadian Forces family and his community.\"\n\n==See also==\n*List of terrorist incidents, 2010\n*Coalition casualties in Afghanistan\n\n==References==\n\n\n\n==External links==\n*  In pictures: Kabul blast, BBC.

{"title":"March 2010 Lahore bombings","article":"The March 2010 Lahore bombings were three separate, but related, bomb attacks in the Pakistani city of Lahore on 8 and 12 March 2010. Lahore, with a population of six million, is Pakistan's second largest city, and the capital of the Punjab province.  After several attacks in Lahore in 2009, these were the first major incidents in the city in 2010.  The 12 March bombings are the deadliest attacks in Pakistan to date in 2010.\n\n==8 March==\nThe 8 March 2010 Lahore bombing was a suicide bombing in Lahore, Pakistan that killed 13 people and injured 90.\n\nAround 0810 PKT, an individual drove a vehicle carrying a large amount of explosives into the Federal Investigation Agency's office in the Model Town district of Lahore. The building collapsed due to the damage it sustained.  The bomb was  in size, powerful enough to create a crater  deep, and injure someone in a house 300\u00a0m away from the detonation.\n\nThe building had previously been attacked on 15 October 2009, in an incident that killed four people.\n\n===Reaction===\n\nPakistani officials have reportedly blamed al-Qaeda and the Taliban for the incident.  Rehman Malik, Pakistan's Interior Minister, said that while more attacks by the Taliban were expected, they were \"desperate measures by a desperate organization\".\n\nPunjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif condemned the attacks and said the victims would be compensated.\n\nA spokesperson for the Taliban in Pakistan claimed the attack was retribution for recent attacks by the Pakistani military and the United States Central Intelligence Agency on tribal areas; and said \"We have 2,800 to 3,000 more suicide bombers\u00a0... We will target all government places, buildings and offices,\" More specifically they said it was to avenge the death of Qari Zafar.\n\nIndia denied involvement in the attacks, following allegations by several Pakistani media sources. \u201cWe categorically reject, once again, the allegations of India's involvement in such acts or activities. The government has reiterated, on several occasions and at the highest level, that India has no interest in destabilizing Pakistan,\u201d the Indian Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement. The ministry said it was unfortunate that by repeating such unfounded and unsubstantiated allegations, officials in responsible positions in the government of Pakistan put a strain on the bilateral relationship, instead of concentrating on dismantling the infrastructure of terrorism directed against India and adversely impacting Pakistan itself\n\nUnited States Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, strongly condemned the blast and expressed sympathy to victims stating that \"The coordinated multiple attacks in Lahore demonstrate the suffering that violent extremist elements are willing to inflict on the people of Pakistan\u00a0\u2013 people who only wish to go about their daily lives in peace.\"\n\n==12 March==\nThe 12 March 2010 Lahore bombings were a series of bombings in Lahore. It was the second attack in Lahore that week, following a bomb explosion at an intelligence headquarters on 8 March 2010.\n\nAround 1300 local time, two men on foot and wearing vests carrying explosives detonated bombs near the Royal Artillery Bazaar.  One man detonated his vest first, followed by the other ten to fifteen seconds later.  It was speculated that the intended target was a military convoy in the area at the time. The blasts wounded about 100 people, mostly civilians, and killed at least 59, of which ten were soldiers. Local Police officials have said that the death toll is likely to rise.  Following the bombings, military reinforcements took control of the area, preventing even news media from entering.\n\nIn the late afternoon, five more bombs were detonated in an Iqbal Town market, but their main consequence was panic.  Some windows were broken, and a car was damaged, and three injuries were reported.\n\nTehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, the same group responsible for the 8 March bombing, has claimed responsibility for these attacks, as well.

{"title":"2010 Baqubah bombings","article":"The 3 March 2010 Baqubah bombings were a series of three bombings in Baqubah, Iraq, on 3 March 2010 that killed at least 33 people and injured 55 others.  Baqubah, a mixed Sunni and Shia town, is the capital of Diyala Governorate, approximately  north of the country's capital, Baghdad.\n\nThe bombings occurred in the lead-up to the parliamentary elections scheduled for 7 March 2010. At 9:45\u00a0am local time, a car bomb was detonated near a police station in the western part of the city.  A few moments later, approximately  away, another car bomb was detonated near the provincial building.  A suicide bomber later detonated a bomb at the hospital where some of the wounded were being treated.  The hospital bomber posed as a police lieutenant and rode an ambulance to the hospital. A fourth bomb was found near the hospital and defused.\n\nAfter the bombings, a full curfew was imposed on the city of Baqubah, barring even pedestrians.  Among the dead were ten policemen, and Dr. Ali al-Timimi, head of Diyala Governorate's health department.\n\nThe perpetrator of the bombings has yet to be identified, but Al-Qaeda in Iraq had previously promised to disrupt the elections on 7 March.  Authorities, both American and Iraqi, have reportedly warned that more attacks could occur before, and even after the elections.  Despite the concerns, early voting began, as scheduled, the morning of 4 March.\n\n==United States response==\nPentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said \"It's disgraceful, it's deplorable. We strongly condemn it, that said, neither this attack nor any of the previous attempts to derail the electoral process and to destabilise the government have been or will be successful.\"\n\n==See also==\n* List of terrorist incidents, 2010\n* Terrorist incidents in Iraq in 2010\n* 2004 Baqubah bombing\n* 2008 Baquba bombings\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/03\/04\/world\/middleeast\/04iraq.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100304035411\/http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/\/2010\/\/03\/\/04\/\/world\/\/middleeast\/\/04iraq.html","http:\/\/english.aljazeera.net\/news\/middleeast\/2010\/03\/201033961873832.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100304030427\/http:\/\/english.aljazeera.net\/news\/middleeast\/2010\/03\/201033961873832.html","http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/ca52f004-26c8-11df-bd0c-00144feabdc0.html","https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/news\/nation-and-world\/la-fg-iraq-bombing4-2010mar04,0,7848363.story","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100304214348\/http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/news\/nation-and-world\/la-fg-iraq-bombing4-2010mar04%2C0%2C7848363.story","http:\/\/www.globalconflictmaps.com\/2010\/03\/03\/suicide-bombings-in-baqubah-iraq-kill-31\/","https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB10001424052748704541304575099592811311992?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_world","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100305111024\/http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB10001424052748704541304575099592811311992.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_world","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-dyn\/content\/article\/2010\/03\/03\/AR2010030300644.html?hpid=topnews","http:\/\/www.timesonline.co.uk\/tol\/news\/world\/iraq\/article7048804.ece","https:\/\/www.google.com\/hostednews\/ap\/article\/ALeqM5hwK_CSpBxsNuVUEaDuOwmSSCiqGwD9E7BD4G2","https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/worldnews\/middleeast\/iraq\/7361744\/Iraq-hit-by-triple-suicide-bomb-ahead-of-election.html","http:\/\/www.miamiherald.com\/2010\/03\/03\/1510517\/at-least-33-iraqis-die-in-3-pre.html","https:\/\/www.irishtimes.com\/newspaper\/world\/2010\/0304\/1224265559279.html","http:\/\/www.chinadaily.com.cn\/world\/2010-03\/03\/content_9533016.htm","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/middle_east\/8547906.stm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100304040522\/http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/middle_east\/8547906.stm","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/03\/05\/world\/middleeast\/05iraq.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100309035359\/http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/03\/05\/world\/middleeast\/05iraq.html","http:\/\/www.abc.net.au\/news\/stories\/2010\/03\/04\/2835999.htm?section=justin","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100409001423\/http:\/\/www.abc.net.au\/news\/stories\/2010\/03\/04\/2835999.htm?section=justin"]}
{"title":"February 2010 Khyber bombing","article":"The February 2010 Khyber bombing was a suicide bombing  in Khyber Agency in Pakistan, on February 10, 2010.  At least 19 people including 13 policemen were killed in a suicide bomb attack against a police patrol.\n\n==Background==\nKhyber Agency  is located in North West Pakistan.  It is on the main supply route for NATO forces stationed in Afghanistan.  It has seen several militant attacks against convoys carrying supplies in the past.\n\n==Attack==\nAccording to officials a local police officer Zurmat Khan appeared to be the target of the attack.  Zurmat Khan had been nominated for a gallantry award Tamgha-i-Jurat which was to have been given on March 23.  He had been previously awarded Rs 350,000 for his bravery in a prior operation against Taliban.   He was leading a patrol when the suicide bomber ran towards his vehicle and detonated himself.  Militants had earlier attacked his home but no one was injured in that attack.  The attack happened on the road NATO uses to supply troops in Afghanistan.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nNo group has yet claimed responsibility for this attack.  A senior police officer in Peshawar stated the most likely the bombing was carried out by Taliban in retaliation for killing of Hakimullah Mehsud.  Altaf Hussain chief of Muttahida Qaumi Movement strongly condemned the blast and expressed his grief.  Rehmatullah Kakar Pakistan's Minister for Housing and Works also condemned the attack\n\n==See also==\n*List of terrorist incidents, 2010\n*List of terrorist incidents in Pakistan since 2001\n\n==References==","urls":["https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/02\/11\/world\/asia\/11pstan.html","http:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/daily_detail.asp?id=223761","http:\/\/www.dallasnews.com\/sharedcontent\/dws\/news\/world\/stories\/DN-pakistan_11int.ART.State.Edition1.4bdc43c.html","http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/wps\/wcm\/connect\/dawn-content-library\/dawn\/news\/pakistan\/07-bomb-attack-kills-six-tribal-policemen-in-khyber-ha-01","http:\/\/www.turkishweekly.net\/other-news\/825857\/18-khasadars-dead-in-suicide-attack.html","http:\/\/www1.voanews.com\/english\/news\/Suicide-Attack-in-PakistanS-Khyber-Region-Kills-18.html","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/south_asia\/8508509.stm","http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/65ab98f2-1653-11df-8d0f-00144feab49a.html","http:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/top_story_detail.asp?Id=27186"]}

{"title":"2010 Lakki Marwat suicide bombing","article":"The 2010 Lakki Marwat suicide bombing occurred on 1 January 2010, in the village of Shah Hassan Khel, Lakki Marwat District, in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.  At least 105 people died and over 100 were injured, many of them critically, when the suicide bomber blew up his sport utility vehicle filled with explosives in the middle of a crowd that had gathered to watch a volleyball game.\n\n==Attack==\n\nIt was thought that the villagers were targeted because they had formed a pro government militia against the Taliban. In weeks before, militants threatened death to anyone who joined the militia. The bomber drove his Mitsubishi Pajero pickup truck into the middle of the playground, at a busy neighborhood, while a game between local male teams was in progress and detonated it. There were up to 400 people present. The bodies of players were thrown through the air by the blast. It was estimated that more than  of explosives were used. Nearly 300 people had been watching the game when the blast happened. Among the dead were six children and five paramilitary soldiers. The remaining fatalities were mostly spectating teenagers. Witnesses said that flames leapt into the sky and there was a bright light before the explosion was heard.\n\nThe villagers had formed a 'peace committee' which was holding a meeting in a mosque when the blast occurred. The roof of the mosque caved in but none of the people attending the meeting were seriously injured. More than twenty surrounding houses were destroyed. People became trapped in collapsed buildings. In the darkness, vehicle headlights were used to search for victims. The blast was felt from 11 miles (18\u00a0kilometers) away.\n\nBy the day after the blast, no group had claimed responsibility for the bombing.  According to analysts, this is frequently the case after an attack has killed many civilians.  Pakistani security analyst retired Lieutenant General Talat Masood stated that attack was most likely carried out in retaliation by Taliban.  He said \"Definitely these are militant elements from North Waziristan and Taliban who have been very angry because the military had had a successful operation in Lakki Marwat and been able to clean up the place.\"\n\n==Reactions==\n\nThe village elders stated after the attack that they would continue opposing the Taliban.  The head of the tribal council stated \"Such attacks will only strengthen our resolve \u2013 being Pashtun, revenge is the only answer to the gruesome killings.\"\n\nAltaf Hussain chief of Muttahida Qaumi Movement condemned the blast and called it an attempt to worsen Pakistan's situation further. The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government has announced Rs300,000 (US$3500, \u20ac2500) compensation for the family of each deceased and Rs100,000 (US$1200, \u20ac800) for each of the injured.\n\n===International reactions===\n*: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton released a statement: \"The United States strongly condemns today's terrorist attack on civilians in Pakistan, and we offer our condolences to the families of the victims and all the people of Pakistan. The Pakistani people have seen terrorists target schools, markets, mosques, and now a volleyball game. The United States will continue to stand with the people of Pakistan in their efforts to chart their own future free from fear and intimidation, and will support their efforts to combat violent extremism and bolster democracy.\"\n*: The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, condemned the attack in a statement: \"I am shocked by the news of [the] brutal bomb attack at a sports event in Lakki Marwat that killed and injured a large number of innocent civilians. [...] In this difficult moment, the EU reaffirms its support for the government and the population of Pakistan.\"\n*: Dmitry Medvedev President of Russia expressed his condolences: \"I was shocked to learn about a new crime committed by extremists \u2013 a bloody terrorist act during a volleyball game in the town of Lakki Marwat. Pakistan can rely on support from Russia and the entire international community in this fight. We have no doubts that the organizers of such inhuman crimes will surely be found and severely punished.\"\n*: The Foreign Office condemned \"this horrific attack that has led to the needless loss of so many lives\".\n*: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed strong condemnation for the attack and Mexico's solidarity with the authorities of the country.\n*: The Canadian minister of foreign affairs Lawrence Cannon stated \"Canada strongly condemns this cowardly attack on the people of Pakistan. We extend our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those killed and wish a speedy recovery to the injured.\"\n\n==See also==\n*List of terrorist incidents, 2010\n*List of terrorist incidents in Pakistan since 2001\n*War in North-West Pakistan\n*Terrorism in Pakistan\n*Sectarian violence in Pakistan\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n* Photo gallery of the attack at BBC.co.uk\n* Video: Pakistan Blast Leaves 88 Dead\n* Video: Bomber strikes Pakistan tournament, Al Jazeera English","urls":["http:\/\/www.thenews.com.pk\/top_story_detail.asp?Id=26449","http:\/\/www.nation.com.pk\/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online\/Politics\/02-Jan-2010\/Bomber-rams-car-into-volleyball-venue","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100103100406\/http:\/\/www.nation.com.pk\/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online\/Politics\/02-Jan-2010\/Bomber-rams-car-into-volleyball-venue","http:\/\/www.timesonline.co.uk\/tol\/news\/world\/asia\/article6973227.ece","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100107022510\/http:\/\/www.timesonline.co.uk\/tol\/news\/world\/asia\/article6973227.ece","http:\/\/www.geo.tv\/1-1-2010\/55995.htm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100103155003\/http:\/\/www.geo.tv\/1-1-2010\/55995.htm","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/01\/02\/world\/asia\/02pstan.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100104230624\/http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/01\/02\/world\/asia\/02pstan.html","http:\/\/news.sky.com\/skynews\/Home\/World-News\/Pakistan-Fans-Killed-In-Suicide-Bomb-Blast-At-Volleyball-Match-In-South-Waziristan\/Article\/201001115512865?lpos=World_News_Carousel_Region_1&lid=ARTICLE_15512865_Pakistan%3A_Fans_Killed_In_Suicide_Bomb_Blast_At_Volleyball_Match_In_South_Waziristan","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100104112117\/http:\/\/news.sky.com\/skynews\/Home\/World-News\/Pakistan-Fans-Killed-In-Suicide-Bomb-Blast-At-Volleyball-Match-In-South-Waziristan\/Article\/201001115512865?lpos=World_News_Carousel_Region_1&lid=ARTICLE_15512865_Pakistan%3A_Fans_Killed_In_Suicide_Bomb_Blast_At_Volleyball_Match_In_South_Waziristan","http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2010\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/01\/02\/pakistan.attacks\/","http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/news\/la-fg-pakistan-bombing2-2010jan02,0,5717778.story","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100104110331\/http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/news\/la-fg-pakistan-bombing2-2010jan02%2C0%2C5717778.story","http:\/\/news.xinhuanet.com\/english\/2010-01\/02\/content_12743143.htm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100116100001\/http:\/\/news.xinhuanet.com\/english\/2010-01\/02\/content_12743143.htm","http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2010\/WORLD\/asiapcf\/01\/01\/pakistan.suicide.bomb\/","http:\/\/www.dailytimes.com.pk\/default.asp?page=2010\\01\\02\\story_2-1-2010_pg1_1","http:\/\/thenews.jang.com.pk\/updates.asp?id=95022","http:\/\/www.rte.ie\/news\/2010\/0101\/pakistan.html","http:\/\/www.euronews.net\/2010\/01\/01\/dozens-killed-in-pakistan-suicide-bombing\/","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100103080249\/http:\/\/www.euronews.net\/2010\/01\/01\/dozens-killed-in-pakistan-suicide-bombing\/","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/south_asia\/8437114.stm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100102052041\/http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/south_asia\/8437114.stm","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/south_asia\/8437473.stm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100103052347\/http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/south_asia\/8437473.stm","http:\/\/english.aljazeera.net\/news\/asia\/2010\/01\/201012121511255970.html","https:\/\/www.thestar.com\/news\/world\/pakistan\/article\/745246--village-bloodied-by-bomb-vows-revenge-on-taliban","http:\/\/thenews.jang.com.pk\/updates.asp?id=95012","http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/wps\/wcm\/connect\/dawn-content-library\/dawn\/news\/pakistan\/suicide+attack+in+lakki+marwat","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100103100715\/http:\/\/www.dawn.com\/wps\/wcm\/connect\/dawn-content-library\/dawn\/news\/pakistan\/suicide%2Battack%2Bin%2Blakki%2Bmarwat","https:\/\/www.state.gov\/secretary\/rm\/2010\/01\/134619.htm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100106225152\/http:\/\/www.state.gov\/secretary\/rm\/2010\/01\/134619.htm","http:\/\/news.xinhuanet.com\/english\/2010-01\/02\/content_12743252.htm","http:\/\/www.khaleejtimes.com\/DisplayArticle08.asp?xfile=data\/international\/2010\/January\/international_January99.xml&section=international","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110608224855\/http:\/\/www.khaleejtimes.com\/DisplayArticle08.asp?xfile=data%2Finternational%2F2010%2FJanuary%2Finternational_January99.xml&section=international","http:\/\/news.xinhuanet.com\/english\/2010-01\/02\/content_12745030.htm","http:\/\/www.fco.gov.uk\/en\/news\/latest-news\/?view=News&id=21512776","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20110604233212\/http:\/\/www.fco.gov.uk\/en\/news\/latest-news\/?view=News&id=21512776","http:\/\/www.eluniversal.com.mx\/notas\/649154.html","https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/world\/pakistani-tribal-elders-defiant-against-taliban-1.972814"]}
{"title":"Russian apartment bombings","article":"The Russian apartment bombings were a series of explosions that hit four apartment blocks in the Russian cities of Buynaksk, Moscow and Volgodonsk in September 1999, killing more than 300, injuring more than 1000, and spreading a wave of fear across the country. The kidnapping of Gennady Shpigun by Chechen rebels in March 1999, the Invasion of Dagestan in August 1999, together with the September bombings triggered the Second Chechen War. Vladimir Putin\u2019s handling of the crisis boosted his popularity greatly and helped him attain the presidency within a few months.\n\nThe blasts hit Buynaksk on 4 September and in Moscow on 9 and 13 September. On 13 September, Russian Duma speaker Gennadiy Seleznyov made an announcement in the Duma about receiving a report that another bombing had just happened in the city of Volgodonsk. A bombing did indeed happen in Volgodonsk, but only three days later, on 16 September. Chechen militants were blamed for the bombings, but denied responsibility, along with Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov.\n\nA suspicious device resembling those used in the bombings was found and defused in an apartment block in the Russian city of Ryazan on 22 September. The next day, Vladimir Putin praised the vigilance of the inhabitants of Ryazan and ordered the air bombing of Grozny, which marked the beginning of the Second Chechen War. Three FSB agents who had planted the devices at Ryazan were arrested by the local police. On 24 September 1999, head of FSB Nikolay Patrushev announced that the incident in Ryazan had been an anti-terror drill and the device found there contained only sugar.\n\nThe official Russian investigation of the Buinaksk bombing was completed in 2000, while the investigation of Moscow and Volgodonsk bombings was completed in 2002. In 2000, seven people were convicted of perpetrating the Buinaksk attack. According to the court ruling on the Moscow and Volgodonsk bombings, which was announced in 2004, the attacks were organised and led by Achemez Gochiyaev, who remains at large. All bombings were ordered by Islamist warlords Ibn Al-Khattab and Abu Omar al-Saif, who have been killed. Five other suspects have been killed and six have been convicted by Russian courts on terrorism-related charges.\n\nParliament member Yuri Shchekochikhin filed two motions for a parliamentary investigation of the events, but the motions were rejected by the Russian Duma in March 2000. An independent public commission to investigate the bombings was chaired by Duma deputy Sergei Kovalev. The commission was rendered ineffective because of government refusal to respond to its inquiries. Two key members of the Kovalev Commission, Sergei Yushenkov and Yuri Shchekochikhin, have since died in apparent assassinations. The Commission\u2019s lawyer and investigator Mikhail Trepashkin was arrested and served four years in prison for revealing state secrets. Former agent Alexander Litvinenko, who blamed FSB for the bombings in two books, was poisoned by FSB agents in London in 2006.\n\nAccording to some historians, the bombings were coordinated by the Russian state security services to bring Putin into the presidency. This view was justified by a number of suspicious events, most notably, the Ryazan incident.\n\nSome experts are critical of that theory, however. Journalists Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan believe that the Ryazan incident was actually a training exercise by the FSB. Former U.S. official Strobe Talbott has pointed out the absence of evidence for the conspiracy theory. Academic Robert Bruce Ware argued that the simplest explanation for the apartment block blasts is that they were indeed perpetrated by Islamist extremists.\n\n\n\n== Bombings ==\n\n=== Overview ===\nFive apartment bombings took place and at least three attempted bombings were prevented. All bombings had the same \"signature\", judging from the nature and the volume of the destruction. In each case a powerful explosive was used, and the timers were set to go off at night and inflict the maximum number of civilian casualties. The explosives were placed to destroy the weakest, most critical elements of the buildings and force the buildings to \"collapse like a house of cards\". The individuals behind the bombings were able to obtain or manufacture several tons of powerful explosives and deliver them to numerous destinations across Russia.\n\n=== Moscow mall ===\nOn 31 August 1999, at 20:00 local time, an explosion took place in \"Okhotny Ryad\" shopping centre on Manezhnaya Square, Moscow. One person was killed and 40 others injured. According to the FSB, the explosion had been caused by a very small bomb of only about 300 gram of explosives. On 2 September 1999, an unknown person called and claimed that the bombing was committed by the nonexistent militant organization \"Liberation Army of Dagestan\".\n\n=== Buynaksk, Dagestan ===\nOn 4 September 1999, at 22:00, a car bomb detonated outside a five-story apartment building in the city of Buynaksk in Dagestan, near the border of Chechnya. The building was housing Russian border guard soldiers and their families. Sixty-four people were killed and 133 were injured in the explosion. Another car bomb was found and defused in the same town. The defused bomb was in a car containing  of explosives. It was discovered by local residents in a parking lot surrounded by an army hospital and residential buildings.\n\n=== Moscow, Pechatniki ===\n\n\nOn 9 September 1999, shortly after midnight local time, at 20:00 GMT, a bomb detonated on the ground floor of an apartment building in southeast Moscow (19 Guryanova Street). The explosive power was equivalent to  of TNT. The nine-story building was destroyed, killing 106 people inside (with early reports giving 93 dead) and injuring 249 others, and damaging 19 nearby buildings. A total of 108 apartments were destroyed during the bombing. An FSB spokesman announced that traces of RDX and TNT were found on items removed from the site of the explosion. Residents said a few minutes before the blast four men were seen speeding away from the building in a car.\n\nRussian President Boris Yeltsin ordered the search of 30,000 residential buildings in Moscow for explosives. He took personal control of the investigation of the blast. Putin declared 13 September a day of mourning for the victims of the attacks.\n\n=== Moscow, Kashirskoye highway ===\n\nOn 13 September 1999, at 05:00, a large bomb exploded in a basement of an apartment block on Kashirskoye Highway in southern Moscow, about  from the place of the last attack. This was the deadliest blast in the chain of bombings (because the house was built with brick), with 119 people killed and 200 injured. The eight-story building was flattened, littering the street with debris and throwing some concrete pieces hundreds of meters away.\n\n=== Moscow, prevented bombings ===\nOn 13 September, the police has found and defused another bomb in an apartment block on Borisovskiye Prudy street in Moscow.\n\nApart from the police measures, citizen patrols helped foil additional bombings in Moscow. According to Irina Svyatenko, a Moscow City Parliament member,\n\n\n=== Volgodonsk ===\n\nA truck bomb exploded on 16 September 1999, outside a nine-story apartment complex in the southern Russian city of Volgodonsk, killing 17 people and injuring 69. The bombing took place at 5:57 am. Surrounding buildings were also damaged. The blast also happened  from a nuclear power plant. Prime Minister Putin signed a decree calling on law enforcement and other agencies to develop plans within three days to protect industry, transportation, communications, food processing centres and nuclear complexes.\n\n=== Ryazan incident ===\nAt 20:30 on 22 September 1999, Alexei Kartofelnikov, a resident of an apartment building in the city of Ryazan noticed two suspicious men who carried sacks into the basement from a car. While the license plate indicated that the car was registered in Moscow, a sheet of paper was taped over the last two digits, and the number written on it implied that the car was local.\n\nKartofelnikov alerted the police, but by the time they arrived the car and the men were gone. The policemen found three sacks of white powder in the basement, each weighing . A detonator and a timing device were attached to the sacks. The detonator was a 12-gauge shotgun shell filled with powder. The timer was set to 5:30 AM. Yuri Tkachenko, the head of the local bomb squad, disconnected the detonator and the timer.  Reportedly, Tkachenko tested the three sacks of white substance with a \"MO-2\" gas analyser, which detected RDX vapors.\n\nInhabitants of the apartment building were evacuated. According to David Satter, residents of neighboring buildings fled their homes in terror, to the effect that nearly 30,000 residents spent the night on the street. Police and rescue vehicles converged from different parts of the city. As many as 1,200 local police officers were put on alert, the railroad stations and the airport were surrounded, and roadblocks were set up on highways leaving the city.\n\nAt 01:30 on  23 September 1999, the explosive engineers took a bit of substance from the suspicious-looking sacks to a firing ground located about  away from Ryazan for testing. During the substance tests at that area they tried to explode it by means of a detonator, but their efforts failed, the substance was not detonated, and the explosion did not occur. At 05:00, Radio Rossiya reported about the attempted bombing, noting that the bomb was set up to go off at 05:30. In the morning, Ryazan resembled a city under siege. Composite sketches of three suspected terrorists, two men and a woman, were posted everywhere in the city and shown on TV. At 08:00 Russian television reported the attempt to blow out the building in Ryazan and identified the explosive used in the bomb as RDX. Vladimir Rushailo announced later that police prevented a terrorist act. A news report at 16:00 reported that the explosives failed to detonate during their testing outside the city.\n\nAt 19:00, Vladimir Putin praised the vigilance of the inhabitants of Ryazan, and called for the air bombing of the Chechen capital Grozny in response to the terrorism acts. He said:\n\n\nOn 23 September Natalia Yukhnova, a telephone service employee in Ryazan, tapped into a suspicious phone call to Moscow and overheard the following instruction: \"Leave one at a time, there are patrols everywhere\". The called number was traced to a telephone exchange unit serving FSB offices.\n\nWhen arrested, the detainees produced FSB identification cards. They were soon released on orders from Moscow.\n\nOn 24 September, FSB director Nikolai Patrushev announced that it was an exercise that was being carried out to test responses after the earlier blasts.\n\nThe Ryazan FSB \"reacted with fury\" and issued a statement saying: \n\n\nFSB also issued a public apology about the incident. In a show \"Independent Investigation\" on NTV, Evgeniy Savostyanov, former director of Moscow and Moscow Oblast regional FSB branch, has criticized the FSB for performing such exercise on residential buildings with inhabitants inside and without notifying local authorities.\n\n==== Explosives in Ryazan controversy ====\nThe position of Russian authorities on the Ryazan incident changed significantly over time. Initially, it was declared by the FSB and federal government to be a real threat. However, after the people who planted the bomb were identified, the official version changed to \"security training\".\n\nIn February 2000, Novaya Gazeta journalist Pavel Voloshin has published an essay What happened in Ryazan: Sugar or Hexogen?, that was partly based on his two-hour long interview with Yuri Tkachenko, the police explosives expert who defused the Ryazan bomb. The essay noted that it's well known that a gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that he was completely certain that the instrument was in correct working order. The gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, making frequent prophylactic checks, because the device contained a radioactive source. Meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. Speaking of the detonator, Voloshin noted that people who disarmed the device (Tkachenko and his bomb squad) claimed that the detonator attached to the sacks was not a dummy and had been prepared on a professional level. The police warrant officer who answered the original call and discovered the bomb insisted that there were no doubts it was a combat situation.\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the Security Agency Worker\u2019s Day in December 2001, Tkachenko said that a gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a shotgun shell that couldn't detonate any known explosives.\n\nIn February 2003, Kommersant journalist Olga Allenova has studied the criminal investigation file on the Ryazan incident, obtained by Russian State Duma member Sergei Kovalev. According to the proceedings, a bomb disposal expert who arrived to the scene has twice performed a test which didn't show the presence of explosive particles. The head of the bomb squad Tkachenko, who arrived soon after that, made a test himself and found the RDX. The investigator who questioned Yuri Tkachenko concluded that the detection of RDX was made possible by contamination of Yuri Tkachenko's hands, since the latter worked with explosives containing RDX on the day before the incident without wearing sterile gloves. Another detail concerned the type of a device used to detect the explosives. The report submitted by the Ryazan UFSB claimed that gas analyser \"M-02\" was used. However, during Tkachenko's questioning it was revealed that he had used the device \"Exprel\" for the analysis. The investigation has resolved the contradiction in the following way. The bomb squad in Ryazan is equipped with the gas analyser \"\u041c-02\", but the latter has certain limitations. The device has a high degree of imprecision, and the analysis takes a long time. So, the bomb squad used the device \"Exprel\", which is more robust, accurate and easy to use. But since they were not supposed to possess that device, the bomb squad has submitted the paperwork which showed that the gas analyser \"M-02\" had been used.\n\nIn March 2000, head of the Ryazan UFSB General Sergeyev appeared on TV show \"Independent Investigation\" commenting on the device used to detect the RDX. According to Sergeyev, it was packed in a briefcase and acted like a litmus test from school. The substance to be investigated was wiped by a collection paper, which was subsequently sprayed from an aerosol can. A change of the paper color indicated the presence of explosives. Sergeyev explained the false positive result by prior contamination of the lid of the briefcase, on which Tkachenko poured some sugar from the sacks to perform the test.\n\n==== The case of private Alexei Pinyaev ====\n\nIn March 2000, Novaya Gazeta journalist Pavel Voloshin reported the account of Private Alexei P. (later identified as Pinyaev) of the 137th Regiment. Pinyaev guarded a storehouse with weapons and ammunition near the city of Ryazan. Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \"sugar\" on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander. He consulted a sapper, who identified the substance as hexogen.\n\nAccording to Felshtinsky and Pribylovsky, after the newspaper report FSB officers descended on Pinyayev\u2019s unit, accused them of divulging a state secret and told them, \"You guys can't even imagine what serious business you\u2019ve got yourselves tangled up in.\" The regiment later sued publishers of Novaya Gazeta for insulting the honour of the Russian Army, since there was no Private Alexei Pinyayev in the regiment, according to their statement.\n\nA report aired by ORT in March 2000 and created by journalist Leonid Grozin and operator Dmitry Vishnevoy has accused Novaya Gazeta of lying. According to Grozin and Vishnevoy, there is no storehouse at the test range of the 137th Regiment. Alexei Pinyaev has admitted meeting with Pavel Voloshin, but claimed that he was merely asked to confirm a pre-conceived story.\n\nAt a FSB press conference in 2001, Private Pinyayev stated that there was no hexogen in the 137th Airborne Regiment and that he was hospitalised in December 1999 and no longer visited the test range.\n\n===Explosives in the apartment bombings===\n\nAfter the bombing at Guryanova Street on September 9, the Moscow FSB reported that items removed from the scene showed traces of TNT and RDX (or \"hexogen\").\n\nLater FSB declared that the explosive used in the bombings was a mixture of aluminium powder, ammonium nitrate, TNT and sugar prepared by the perpetrators in a concrete mixer at a fertiliser factory in Urus-Martan, Chechnya. Also, each bomb contained some plastic explosive used as an explosive booster.\n\nRDX is produced in only one factory in Russia, in the city of Perm. According to David Satter, the FSB changed the story about the type of explosive, since it was difficult to explain how huge amounts of RDX disappeared from the closely guarded Perm facility.\n\nAccording to Satter, all four bombings that occurred had a similar \"signature\" which indicated that the explosives had been carefully prepared, a mark of skilled specialists. There is also no explanation as to how the terrorists were able to obtain tons of hexogen explosive and transport it to various locations in Russia; hexogen is produced in one plant in Perm Oblast for which the central FSB is responsible for the security. The culprits would also have needed to organise nine explosions (the four that occurred and the five attempted bombings reported by the authorities) in different cities in a two-week period. Satter's estimate for the time required for target plan development, site visits, explosives preparation, renting space at the sites and transporting explosives to the sites was four to four and a half months.\n\nAccording to Lieutenant General of the FSB Ivan Mironov, the precise composition of the explosive mixture was hard to determine, because no visible traces remain after the aluminium powder is consumed in a blast. Mironov credited Abu Omar with developing the technology of explosions, which was taught to perpetrators in training camps near Serzhen-Yurt and Urus-Martan. The explosive mixture was relatively easy to produce, while some components could be obtained pretty much from a kitchen.\n\n===Controversy over the prevented bombings===\nAccording to Russian newspaper Kommersant and the public relations centre of the FSB, further bombings in Moscow were prevented with the help of a real estate agent who called the police after the second bombing in Moscow and told it about his client, who rented basements in the two buildings which were blown up in Moscow. The client was identified as Achemez Gochiyaev.\n\nAccording to Litvinenko, Felshtinsky and Goldfarb, on 13 September 1999, Achemez Gochiyaev called and reported about bombs planted in several locations. Gochiyaev claimed that he was framed by his old acquaintance, an FSB officer who asked him to rent basements \"as storage facilities\" at four locations where bombs were later found. After the second explosion on Kashirskoe highway Gochiyaev recognized he was set up, called the police and told them about the basements of two other buildings at Borisovskie Prudy and Kopotnya, where the explosives were actually found and explosions averted.\n\nIvan Mironov, a lieutenant general of the FSB, has accused Gochiyaev of lying.\n\n== Related events ==\n\n=== Law on Freedom of Movement ===\n\nIn 1993, the Supreme Soviet of Russia adopted the \"Law on Freedom of Movement and Freedom of Choice of Residence\", which abolished the propiska system. Under the new law, no official authorization to live in a certain place was needed.\n\nYuri Luzhkov, a mayor of Moscow at the time of the bombings, believed that while the bombings in Moscow were caused by unresolved problems of 1990s in Russia, authors of that liberal law have torpedoed Moscow. The law made it possible for Chechen terrorists to bring weapons to Moscow and store them there, as well as purchase auto vehicles and provide housing for tens of bandits who had arrived in Moscow. According to Luzhkov, \"for three months, after having arrived in Moscow, a terrorist could live wherever he wanted and stay with anyone, without notifying the police\", which allowed the criminals to prepare the bombings.\n\n=== War of Dagestan ===\n\nOn 7 August 1999, an Islamist group, led by Shamil Basayev and Ibn al-Khattab, invaded the Russian republic of Dagestan.\n\n=== Advanced warnings about the impending bombings ===\nIn July 1999, Russian journalist Aleksandr Zhilin, writing in the Moskovskaya pravda, warned that there would be terrorist attacks in Moscow organised by the government. Using a leaked Kremlin document as evidence, he added that the motive would be to undermine the opponents of the Russian President Boris Yeltsin. These included Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov and former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov. However, this warning was ignored.\n\nAccording to Amy Knight, \"even more significant is the fact that a respected and influential Duma deputy, Konstantin Borovoi, was told on September 9, the day of the first Moscow apartment bombing, that there was to be a terrorist attack in the city. His source was an officer of the Russian military intelligence (GRU). Borovoy transmitted this information to FSB officials serving on Yeltsin's Security Council, but he was ignored.\"\n\nOn 13 September 1999, Novaya Gazeta published a report by retired army major Vyacheslav Izmailov, which said that the editorial board of Novaya gazeta had received information about the planned terrorist attacks from its sources in Chechnya. According to the report, terrorist attacks were organized by Ibn Al-Khattab, Shamil Basayev and Shirvani Basayev, who sent groups of terrorists to Dagestan, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Rostov and, possibly, other cities. In a follow-up article published on 20 September 1999, Izmailov revealed that Novaya Gazeta had received the information on 8 September, twelve hours before the bombing on Guryanova street in Moscow, and immediately relayed it to the Chief Directorate Combating Organized Crime of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. According to Izmailov, as many as 10 terrorist attacks have been planned.\n\n=== Announcement of impending Volgodonsk bombings in the Russian Duma ===\nOn 13 September, just hours after the second explosion in Moscow, Russian Duma speaker Gennadiy Seleznyov of the Communist Party made an announcement, \"I have just received a report. According to information from Rostov-on-Don, an apartment building in the city of Volgodonsk was blown up last night.\" When the Volgodonsk bombing happened on 16 September, Vladimir Zhirinovsky demanded the following day an explanation in the Duma, but Seleznyov turned his microphone off. Vladimir Zhirinovsky said in the Russian Duma: \"Remember, Gennadiy Nikolaevich, how you told us that an apartment block has been blown up in Volgodonsk, three days prior to the blast? How should we interpret this? The State Duma knows that the apartment block was destroyed on Monday, and it has indeed been blown up on Thursday [same week]...\"\n\nAlexander Litvinenko believed that someone had mixed up the order of the blasts, \"the usual Kontora mess up\". According to Litvinenko, \"Moscow-2 was on the 13th and Volgodonsk on 16th, but they got it to the speaker the other way around\". Investigator Mikhail Trepashkin confirmed that the man who gave Seleznyov the note was indeed an FSB officer.\n\nIn an August 2017 interview with Yuri Dud, Vladimir Zhirinovsky suggested that the FSB had information that a terrorist attack in Volgodonsk was being prepared and relayed that to Seleznyov. However, due to a quite tense atmosphere in Russia at the time, the person responsible for relaying the message made a mistake, and Seleznyov was told that the attack in Volgodonsk had already occurred. Zhirinovsky denied the possibility that the bombing could be perpetrated by the FSB, citing the lack of utility, but claimed that the FSB could know about possible sites of terrorist attacks. That would be major cities, Rostov Oblast was at risk because of its proximity to the Caucasus, and Volgodonsk could be a site of an attack because of its nuclear power plant.\n\n=== Sealing of all materials by the Russian Duma ===\nThe Russian Duma rejected two motions for parliamentary investigation of the Ryazan incident. In the Duma a pro-Kremlin party Unity, voted to seal all materials related to the Ryazan incident for the next 75 years and forbade an investigation into what happened.\n\n=== Claims and denials of responsibility for the blasts ===\nOn 9 September, an anonymous person, speaking with a Caucasian accent, phoned the Interfax news agency, saying that the blasts in Moscow and Buynaksk were \"our response to the bombings of civilians in the villages in Chechnya and Dagestan.\"\n\nOn 15 September, an unidentified man, again speaking with a Caucasian accent, called the ITAR-TASS news agency, claiming to represent a group called the Liberation Army of Dagestan. He said that the explosions in Buynaksk and Moscow were carried out by his organisation. According to him, the attacks were a retaliation to the deaths of Muslim women and children during Russian air raids in Dagestan. \"We will answer death with death,\" the caller said. Russian officials from both the Interior Ministry and FSB, at the time, expressed scepticism over the claims and said there is no such organization  On 15 September 1999, a Dagestani official also denied the existence of a \"Dagestan Liberation Army\".\n\nIn an interview published in Lidove Noviny on September 9, Shamil Basayev denied responsibility for the bombings and said that it had been the work of Dagestanis. According to Basayev, the bombings were a retribution for the military operation of the Russian Army against \"three small villages\" in Dagestan. In subsequent interviews, Basayev said he didn't know who perpetrated the bombings.\n\nIn the interview with Associated Press held between 9 September and 13 September, and published on 14 September, Ibn al-Khattab said that \"From now on they will get our bombs everywhere. Let Russia await our explosions blasting through their cities. I swear we will do it.\" However, in a subsequent interview on 14 September to the Interfax agency in Grozny, Khattab denied responsibility for the bombings.\n\nChechen Foreign Ministry issued an official statement on 14 September condemning Moscow blasts, and affirming that \"Ichkeria stands firmly against terrorism in any manifestation\".\n\n== Russia's Internal Investigations ==\n\n=== Criminal investigation and court ruling ===\nIn 2000, investigation of the Buynaksk attack was complete and seven people were convicted of the bombing.\n\nRussia's pre-trial investigation of the Moscow and Volgodonsk bombings was finished in 2002. According to the Russian State Prosecutor office, all apartment bombings were executed under command of ethnic Karachay Achemez Gochiyayev and planned by Ibn al-Khattab and Abu Omar al-Saif, Arab militants fighting in Chechnya on the side of Chechen insurgents. Al-Khattab and al-Saif were killed during the Second Chechen War. According to investigators, the explosives were prepared at a fertiliser factory in Urus-Martan Chechnya, by \"mixing aluminium powder, nitre and sugar in a concrete mixer\", or by also putting there RDX and TNT. From there they were sent to a food storage facility in Kislovodsk, which was managed by an uncle of one of the terrorists, Yusuf Krymshakhalov. Another conspirator, Ruslan Magayayev, leased a KamAZ truck in which the sacks were stored for two months. After everything was planned, the participants were organised into several groups which then transported the explosives to different cities.\n\nAccording to investigators, the explosion in Moscow mall on 31 August was committed by another man, Magomed-Zagir Garzhikaev on the orders from Shamil Basayev, according to the FSB.\n\nCourt hearings on the Moscow and Volgodonsk attacks were held behind closed doors, and were completed in 2004. The process has produced 90 volumes of proceedings, 5 of which were classified.\n\n==== Court rulings ====\nAccording to the court ruling, Al-Khattab paid Gochiyayev $500,000 to carry out the attacks at Guryanova Street, Kashirskoye Highway, and Borisovskiye Prudy, and then helped to hide Gochiyayev and his accomplices in Chechnya. In early September 1999, Magayayev, Krymshamkhalov, Batchayev and Dekkushev reloaded the cargo into a Mercedes-Benz 2236 trailer and delivered it to Moscow. En route, they were protected from possible complications by an accomplice, Khakim Abayev, who accompanied the trailer in another car. In Moscow they were met by Achemez Gochiyayev, who registered in Hotel Altai under the fake name \"Laipanov\", and Denis Saitakov. The explosives were left in a warehouse in Ulitsa Krasnodonskaya, which was leased by pseudo-Laipanov (Gochiyayev). The next day, the explosives were delivered in \"ZIL-5301\" vans to three addresses\u2014Ulitsa Guryanova, Kashirskoye Shosse and Ulitsa Borisovskiye Prudy, where pseudo-Laipanov leased cellars. Gochiyayev supervised the placement of the bombs in the rented cellars. Next followed the explosions at the former two addresses. The explosion at 16 Borisovskiye Prudy was prevented.\n\nAccording to the court, 4 September Buinaksk bombing was ordered by Al-Khattab. Reportedly, since the perpetrators have managed to explode only one truck bomb instead of the two, Khattab called it a \"botched job\" and paid $300,000 for it, which was a part of the sum he originally promised. One of the suspects confessed having loaded the trucks with sacks in Buynaksk, but claimed he did not know what they were intended for.\n\nThe explosion in the mall on Manezhnaya Square was the subject of a separate court process held in Moscow in 2009. The court accused Khalid Khuguyev and Magumadzir Gadzhikayev of organisation and execution of the 1999 explosions in the Manezhnaya Square mall and in hotel Intourist and sentenced them to 25 years and 15 years of imprisonment, correspondingly.\n\n==== Sentences ====\n and  have both been sentenced to life terms in a special regime colony. Both defendants have pleaded guilty only to some of the charges. For instance, Dekkushev acknowledged that he knew the explosives he transported were to be used for an act of terror. Dekkushev also confirmed Gochiyaev's role in the attacks. Dekkushev was extradited to Russia on 14 April 2002 to stand trial. Krymshakhalov was apprehended and extradicted to Moscow. Achemez Gochiyaev, the head of the group that carried out the attacks and allegedly the main organiser, remains a fugitive, and is under an international search warrant. In a statement released in January 2004, the FSB said, \"until we arrest Gochiyayev, the case [of the apartment block bombings of 1999] will not be closed.\"\n\n==== Suspects and accused ====\nIn September 1999, hundreds of Chechen nationals (out of the more than 100,000 permanently living in Moscow) were briefly detained and interrogated in Moscow, as a wave of anti-Chechen sentiments swept the city. All of them turned out to be innocent.\n\nAccording to the official investigation, the following people either delivered explosives, stored them, or harboured other suspects:\n\n===== Moscow bombings =====\n* Ibn al-Khattab (a Saudi-born Mujahid), who was poisoned by the FSB in 2002.\n* Achemez Gochiyayev (an ethnic Karachai, has not been arrested; he is still at large)\n* Denis Saitakov (an ethnic Tatar from Uzbekistan), killed in Georgia in 1999\u20132000\n* Khakim Abayev (an ethnic Karachai), killed by FSB special forces in May 2004 in Ingushetia\n* Ravil Akhmyarov (a Russian citizen), Surname indicates an ethnic Tatar, killed in Chechnya in 1999\u20132000\n* Yusuf Krymshamkhalov (an ethnic Karachai and resident of Kislovodsk), arrested in Georgia in December 2002, extradited to Russia and sentenced to life imprisonment in January 2004, after a two-month secret trial held without a jury\n* Stanislav Lyubichev (a traffic police inspector, resident of Kislovodsk, Stavropol Krai), who helped the truck with explosives pass the checkpoint after getting a sack of sugar as a bribe, sentenced to four years in May 2003\n\n===== Volgodonsk bombing =====\n* Timur Batchayev (an ethnic Karachai), killed in Georgia in the clash with police during which Krymshakhalov was arrested\n* Zaur Batchayev (an ethnic Karachai) killed in Chechnya in 1999\u20132000\n* Adam Dekkushev (an ethnic Karachai), arrested in Georgia, threw a grenade at police during the arrest, extradited to Russia and sentenced to life imprisonment in January 2004, after a two-month secret trial held without a jury\n\n===== Buinaksk bombing =====\n* Isa Zainutdinov (an ethnic Avar) and native of Dagestan, sentenced to life imprisonment in March 2001\n* Alisultan Salikhov (an ethnic Avar) and native of Dagestan, sentenced to life imprisonment in March 2001\n* Magomed Salikhov (an ethnic Avar) and native of Dagestan, arrested in Azerbaijan in November 2004, extradited to Russia, found not guilty on the charge of terrorism by the jury on 24 January 2006; found guilty of participating in an armed force and illegal crossing of the national border, he was retried again on the same charges on 13 November 2006 and again found not guilty, this time on all charges, including the ones he was found guilty of in the first trial. According to Kommersant Salikhov admitted that he made a delivery of paint to Dagestan for Ibn al-Khattab, although he was not sure what was really delivered.\n* Ziyavudin Ziyavudinov (a native of Dagestan), arrested in Kazakhstan, extradited to Russia, sentenced to 24 years in April 2002\n* Abdulkadyr Abdulkadyrov (an ethnic Avar) and native of Dagestan, sentenced to 9 years in March 2001\n* Magomed Magomedov (Sentenced to 9 years in March 2001)\n* Zainutdin Zainutdinov (an ethnic Avar) and native of Dagestan, sentenced to 3 years in March 2001 and immediately released under amnesty\n* Makhach Abdulsamedov (a native of Dagestan, sentenced to 3 years in March 2001 and immediately released under amnesty).\n\n=== Attempts at an independent investigation ===\nThe Russian Duma rejected two motions for a parliamentary investigation of the Ryazan incident.\n\nAn independent public commission to investigate the bombings was chaired by Duma deputy Sergei Kovalyov. The commission started its work in February 2002. On 5 March Sergei Yushenkov and Duma member Yuli Rybakov flew to London where they met Alexander Litvinenko and Mikhail Trepashkin. After this meeting, Trepashkin began working with the commission.\n\nHowever, the public commission was rendered ineffective because of government refusal to respond to its inquiries. Two key members of the Commission, Sergei Yushenkov and Yuri Shchekochikhin, both Duma members, have died in apparent assassinations in April 2003 and July 2003, respectively. Another member of the commission, Otto Lacis, was assaulted in November 2003 and two years later, on 3 November 2005, he died in a hospital after a car accident.\n\nThe commission asked lawyer Mikhail Trepashkin to investigate the case. Trepashkin claimed to have found that the basement of one of the bombed buildings was rented by FSB officer Vladimir Romanovich and that the latter was witnessed by several people. Trepashkin also investigated a letter attributed to Achemez Gochiyayev and found that the alleged assistant of Gochiyayev who arranged the delivery of sacks might have been Kapstroi-2000 vice president Alexander Karmishin, a resident of Vyazma.\n\nTrepashkin was unable to bring the alleged evidence to the court because he was arrested in October 2003 (on charges of illegal arms possession) and imprisoned in Nizhny Tagil, just a few days before he was to make his findings public. He was sentenced by a Moscow military closed court to four years imprisonment on a charge of revealing state secrets. Amnesty International issued a statement that \"there are serious grounds to believe that Mikhail Trepashkin was arrested and convicted under falsified criminal charges which may be politically motivated, in order to prevent him continuing his investigative and legal work related to the 1999 apartment bombings in Moscow and other cities\".\n\nIn a letter to Olga Konskaya, Trepashkin wrote that some time before the bombings, Moscow's Regional Directorate against Organized Crimes (RUOP GUVD) arrested several people for selling the explosive RDX. Following that, Nikolai Patrushev's Directorate of FSB officers came to the GUVD headquarters, captured evidence and ordered the investigators fired. Trepashkin wrote that he learned about the story at a meeting with several RUOP officers in the year 2000. They claimed that their colleagues could present eyewitness accounts in a court. They offered a videocassette with evidence against the RDX dealers. Mr Trepashkin did not publicise the meeting fearing for lives of the witnesses and their families.\n\nAccording to Trepashkin, his supervisors and the people from the FSB promised not to arrest him if he left the Kovalev commission and started working together with the FSB \"against Alexander Litvinenko\".\n\nOn 24 March 2000, two days before the presidential elections, NTV Russia featured the Ryazan events of Fall 1999 in the talk show Independent Investigation. The talk with the residents of the Ryazan apartment building along with FSB public relations director Alexander Zdanovich and Ryazan branch head Alexander Sergeyev was filmed few days earlier. On 26 March, Boris Nemtsov voiced his concern over the possible shut-down of NTV for airing the talk. Seven months later, NTV general manager  said at the JFK School of Government that Information Minister Mikhail Lesin warned him on several occasions.  Malashenko's recollection of Lesin's warning was that by airing the talk show NTV \"crossed the line\" and that the NTV managers were \"outlaws\" in the eyes of the Kremlin. According to Alexander Goldfarb, Mr. Malashenko told him that Valentin Yumashev brought a warning from the Kremlin, one day before airing the show, promising in no uncertain terms that the NTV managers \"should consider themselves finished\" if they went ahead with the broadcast.\n\nArtyom Borovik was among the people who investigated the bombings. He received numerous death threats and died in a suspicious plane crash in March 2000 that was regarded by Felshtinsky and Pribylovsky as a probable assassination.\n\nJournalist Anna Politkovskaya and former security service member Alexander Litvinenko, who investigated the bombings, were killed in 2006.\n\nSurviving victims of the Guryanova street bombing asked President Dmitry Medvedev to resume the official investigation in 2008, but it was not resumed.\n\nIn a 2017 discussion at the RFE\/RL Sergei Kovalyov said: \"I think that the Chechen trace was skilfully fabricated. No one from the people who organized the bombings was found, and no one actually was looking for them\". He then was asked by Vladimir Kara-Murza if he believes that several key members of his commission, and even Boris Berezovskiy and Boris Nemtsov who \"knew quite a few things about the bombings\" were killed to prevent the independent investigation. Kovalev responded: \"I cannot state with full confidence that the explosions were organized by the authorities. Although it's clear that the explosions were useful for them, useful for future President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, because he had just promised to \"waste in the outhouse\" (as he said) everyone who had any relation to terrorism. It was politically beneficial for him to scare people with terrorism. That is not proven. But what can be stated with full confidence is this: the investigation of both the Moscow explosions and the so-called \"exercises\" in Ryazan is trumped up. There can be various possibilities. It seems to me, that Ryazan should have been the next explosion, but I cannot prove that.\"\n\nAccording to Elena Pokalova, an expert in security issues, Kovalev's commission \"did not produce conclusive evidence to incriminate Russia's security services\".\n\n== Russian government involvement theory ==\nAccording to David Satter, Yuri Felshtinsky, Alexander Litvinenko, Vladimir Pribylovsky and Boris Kagarlitsky, the bombings were a successful coup d'\u00e9tat coordinated by the Russian state security services to win public support for a new full-scale war in Chechnya and to bring Putin to power. Some of them described the bombings as typical \"active measures\" practised by the KGB in the past. The war in Chechnya boosted Prime Minister and former FSB Director Vladimir Putin's popularity, and brought the pro-war Unity Party to the State Duma and Putin to the presidency within a few months.\n\nDavid Satter stated, during his testimony in the United States House of Representatives, that \"With Yeltsin and his family facing possible criminal prosecution, however, a plan was put into motion to put in place a successor who would guarantee that Yeltsin and his family would be safe from prosecution and the criminal division of property in the country would not be subject to reexamination. For \"Operation Successor\" to succeed, however, it was necessary to have a massive provocation. In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early. Putin was elected president and his first act was to guarantee Yeltsin immunity from prosecution.\"\n\nAccording to reconstruction of the events by Felshtinsky and Pribylovsky,\n* The bombings in Buynaksk were carried out by a team of twelve GRU officers who were sent to Dagestan and supervised by the head of GRU's 14th Directorate General Kostechenko. That version was partly based on a testimony by Aleksey Galkin. The bombing in Buynaksk was conducted by the GRU to avoid an \"interagency conflict between the FSB and the Ministry of Defense\".\n* In Moscow, Volgodonsk and Ryazan, the attacks were organized by the FSB through a chain of command that included director of the counter-terrorism department General German Ugryumov, FSB operatives Maxim Lazovsky, Vladimir Romanovich, Ramazan Dyshekov and others. Achemez Gochiyayev, Tatyana Korolyeva, and Alexander Karmishin rented warehouses that received shipments of hexogen disguised as sugar and possibly did not know that the explosives were delivered. \n* Adam Dekkushev, Krymshamkhalov, and Timur Batchayev were recruited by FSB agents who presented themselves as \"Chechen separatists\" to deliver explosives to Volgodonsk and Moscow.\n* Names and the fate of FSB agents who planted the bomb in the city of Ryazan remain unknown.\n\n=== Support ===\nHistorian Amy Knight wrote that it was \"abundantly clear\" that the FSB was responsible for carrying out the attacks and that Vladimir Putin's \"guilt seems clear,\" since it was inconceivable that the FSB would have done so without the sanction of Putin, the agency's former director and by then Prime Minister of Russia.\n\nDavid Satter considers the bombings as a political provocation by the Russian secret services that was similar to the burning of the Reichstag.\n\nIn 2003, U.S. senator John McCain said that \"It was during Mr. Putin's tenure as Prime Minister in 1999 that he launched the Second Chechen War following the Moscow apartment bombings. There remain credible allegations that Russia's FSB had a hand in carrying out these attacks. Mr. Putin ascended to the presidency in 2000 by pointing a finger at the Chechens for committing these crimes, launching a new military campaign in Chechnya, and riding a frenzy of public anger into office.\"\n\nFormer Russian State Security Council chief Alexandr Lebed in his 29 September 1999 interview with Le Figaro said he was almost convinced that the government organised the terrorist acts. Later Lebed's public relations staff claimed that he was quoted out of the context.\n\nAndrei Illarionov, a former key economic adviser to the Russian president, said that FSB involvement \"is not a theory, it is a fact. There is no other element that could have organized the bombings except for the FSB.\"\n\nA PBS Frontline documentary on Vladimir Putin also mentioned the theory and FSB involvement, citing the quick removal of rubble and bodies from the bombing scenes before any investigation could take place, the discovery of the Ryazan bomb, the deaths of several people who had attempted to investigate the bombings, as well as the defused Ryazan bomb being made of Russian military explosives and detonators.\n\nAccording to former KGB officer Konstantin Preobrazhensky, \"Litvinenko's accusations are not unfounded. Chechen rebels were incapable of organising a series of bombings without help from high-ranking Moscow officials.\"\n\nIn 2008, British journalist Edward Lucas concluded in his book The New Cold War: Putin's Russia and the Threat to the West that \"The weight of evidence so far supports the grimmest interpretation: that the attacks were a ruthlessly planned stunt to create a climate of panic and fear in which Putin would quickly become the country's indisputable leader, as indeed he did.\"\n\nIn the September 2009 issue of GQ, veteran war correspondent Scott Anderson wrote about on Putin's role in the Russian apartment bombings, based in part on his interviews with Mikhail Trepashkin The journal owner, Cond\u00e9 Nast, then took extreme measures to prevent an article by Anderson from appearing in the Russian media, both physically and in translation.\n\nIn her book Putin's Kleptocracy, historian Karen Dawisha summarized evidence related to the bombings and concluded that \"to blow up your own innocent and sleeping people in your capital city is an action almost unthinkable. Yet the evidence that the FSB was at least involved in planting a bomb in Ryazan is incontrovertible.\"\n\nAccording to Timothy Snyder, \"it seemed possible\" that the perpetrators of the apartment bombings were FSB officers.\n\n=== Criticism ===\nIn March 2000, Putin dismissed the allegations of FSB involvement in the bombings as \"delirious nonsense.\" \"There are no people in the Russian secret services who would be capable of such crime against their own people. The very allegation is immoral,\" he said. An FSB spokesman said that \"Litvinenko's evidence cannot be taken seriously by those who are investigating the bombings\".\n\nAccording to Strobe Talbott who was a United States Deputy Secretary of State during the events, \"there was no evidence to support\" the \"conspiracy theory, although Russian public opinion did indeed solidify behind Putin in his determination to carry out a swift, decisive counteroffensive.\" The U.S. believed that leaders of Chechen rebels had \"indisputably\u2014and, it seemed, deliberately\u2014brought down the wrath of the Russian armed forces on their people\". Therefore, the U.S. has limited its response to the Chechen conflict to urging Russia to follow its obligations under various international treaties to protect civilian life.\n\nAccording to historian Ren\u00e9 De La Pedraja, after the kidnapping of a high official of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Gennady Shpigun, in March 1999, the ministry developed a plan for a limited military campaign to occupy the northern third of Chechnya up to the Terek River valley. As the FSB chief, Putin strongly supported the Terek River Valley plan. As a prime minister, Putin showd every intention to respond to the Dagestan invasion with the original plan to occupy the northern third of Chechnya, while carrying out the original proposal on an accelerated schedule to provide a timely response to the attack. However, after terrorists perpetrated the apartment bombings, \"the usually cool and cautious Putin was swept away in the popular outrage\" and decided to approve a much more ambitious campaign to subdue all of Chechnya, while the Russian Army wasn't prepared to pursue that campaign.\n\nAccording to Russian investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov, \"From the start, it seemed that the Kremlin was determined to suppress all discussion ... When Alexander Podrabinek, a Russian human rights activist, tried to import copies of Litvinenko's and Felshtinsky's Blowing up Russia in 2003, they were confiscated by the FSB. Trepashkin himself, acting as a lawyer for two relatives of the victims of the blast, was unable to obtain information he requested and was entitled to see by law\". However, Soldatov believed that the obstruction might reflect \"\u201cparanoia\u201d rather than guilt on the part of the authorities\". Consequently, Soldatov argued, that paranoia has produced the very conspiracy theories that the Russian Government intended to eradicate.\n\nJournalists Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan in their 2010 book The New Nobility have expressed their conviction that the Ryazan incident had actually been a training exercise. According to the authors, such exercises are typical for Vympel, an unit of the FSB whose mission is to verify the efficacy of counterterrorism measures at sites such as nuclear plants. In authors' opinion, the book Blowing Up Russia by Felshtinsky and Litvinenko contained no new evidence against the FSB, and claims by Trepashkin were highly dubious. Soldatov and Borogan noted that the main point of allegations against the FSB was that Achemez Gochiyaev was an innocent businessman, who was made a scapegoat by the FSB and falsely accused of perpetrating the bombings. While in fact, Gochiyaev was well known in the Russian republic of Karachaevo-Cherkessia as a leader of a local islamist group since mid-1990s. Gochiyaev, Dekkushev and Krymshamkhalov were members of the \"Muslim Society No. 3\", founded in 1995, which counted more than 500 members by 2001, and was responsible for a series of terrorist attacks in early 2000s. Soldatov and Borogan have also noted a partial admission of guilt by Dekkushev and Krymshamkhalov during a trial in 2003.\n\nIn an interview published on May 18, 2020, Ukrainian journalist Dmitry Gordon asked former FSB officer Igor Strelkov, whether the latter took part in the FSB special operation to blow up the apartment buildings in Russia. Strelkov replied that he doubted that was a special operation at all. He clarified that during the initial stage of the Second Chechen war, he was a part of a group which attempted to capture Achemez Gochiyaev. The effort was for real, and no one in the group had doubts that it was Gochiyaev and his people who blew up the apartment buildings, at least in Volgodonsk. When pressed further with the original question, Strelkov said that, definitely, he did not blow up the blocks of apartments.\n\nAmerican journalist Paul Klebnikov believed that the most likely explanation for the bombings was that they were in fact perpetrated by Chechen militants or Islamic extremists. To support his view, Klebnikov cited past terrorist attacks by Basayev and other Chechen militants, Khattab's links to Osama bin Laden and the brutality demonstrated by Chechen field commanders in their handling of Russian prisoners of war and civilian hostages. On the contrary, Klebnikov found it hard to believe that the bombings were organized by Putin, citing his \"unusual dedication to a fixed code of conduct (albeit an authoritarian one)\".\n\nAccording to Robert Bruce Ware, the simplest explanation for the apartment block blasts is that they were perpetrated by Islamist extremists from North Caucasus who sought retribution for the attacks of the Federal forces against the Islamist enclave in the central Dagestan, known as the Islamic Djamaat. Ware points out that that would explain the timing of the attacks, and why there were no attacks after the date on which the insurgents were driven from Dagestan. It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that David Satter and Rajan Menon use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to false flag conspiracy theories such as 9\/11 conspiracy theories and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent Armed Islamic Group, emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria has achieved a de facto independence from Russia after the Khasavyurt Accord, with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.\n\nPolitical scientist Ronald R. Pope in his review of David Satter's book Darkness at Dawn cited Kirill Pankratov's criticism, published as a contribution to Johnson's Russia List. Regarding the apartment bombings, Pankratov argued that the Russian authorities did not need an additional justification to wage a war against Chechnya, in view of high-profile kidnappings and the invasion of Dagestan. One of his other arguments was that the theory of FSB responsibility for the bombings implied that it had been able to keep the lid on the operation much more effectively than the FSB had been able to execute it.\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.\n\nPolitical scientist Andrei Tsygankov criticizes the promotion of the 1999 conspiracy theory, which claims that the Kremlin was responsible for the apartment bombings, in the West. Tsygankov argues that that gives an air of legitimacy to main assertions of the theory, despite weak evidence.\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer noted that \"The FSB accused Khattab and Gochiyaev, but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov's regime, which is what the war was launched against.\"\n\n== Position of the US government ==\nIn the wake of the apartment bombings president Clinton, secretary of defense Cohen and secretary of state Albright have condemned the bombings as acts of terrorism.\n\nIn an interview with Novaya Gazeta published on 27 September 1999, director of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare Yossef Bodansky claimed that the goal of extremists, who blew up the apartment buildings, was to make the war in the Caucasus untenable for Russians and cause the latter to demand the cessation of hostilities.\n\nDuring a 4 November 1999 Senate hearing, the position of the U.S. administration in relation to the conflict in Chechnya has been voiced by ambassador-at-large Stephen Sestanovich. According to Sestanovich, Russia had \"an obligation to protect itself and its citizens from terrorists and other attacks\", however, the said obligation did not justify violations of human rights such as indiscriminate attacks against civilians and closing borders to prevent civilians from fleeing.\n\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state Madeleine Albright was questioned by senator Jesse Helms during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Albright was asked whether Russian Government was justified when it accused Chechen groups of perpetrating the bombings and whether she could forward to the Committee any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen entities. She responded that the U.S. Government had condemned the bombings in the harshest terms and offered Russia its help with the ongoing investigation, while \"we have not seen evidence that ties the bombings to Chechnya.\"\n\nOn 11 January 2017, senator Marco Rubio raised the issue of the 1999 bombings during the confirmation hearings for Rex Tillerson. According to senator Rubio, \"there's [an] incredible  body of reporting, open source and other, that this was all\u2014all those bombings were part of a black flag operation on the part of the FSB.\"\n\nOn 10 January 2018, senator Ben Cardin of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee released a report entitled \"Putin's Asymmetric Assault on Democracy in Russia and Europe: Implications for U.S. National Security\". According to the report, \"no credible evidence has been presented by the Russian authorities linking Chechen terrorists, or anyone else, to the Moscow bombings.\"\n\n===GTD entries===\n\nAccording to the Global Terrorism Database, Chechen rebels led by Khattab were suspected of perpetrating the bombings in Buynaksk, Moscow and Volgodonsk, while no responsibility had been claimed.\n\n===FOIA requests===\n\nOn 14 July 2016, David Satter filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with the State Department, the CIA and the FBI, inquiring about documents pertaining to the apartment bombings, the Ryazan incident and persons who tried to investigate the bombings and were killed. The agencies acknowledged receipt of the requests, but Satter received no other response within the statutory time limit. On 29 August 2016, Satter filed suit against the Department of Justice and other agencies involved.\n\nCIA refused even to acknowledge the existence of any relevant records because doing so would reveal \"very specific aspects of the Agency's intelligence interest, or lack thereof, in the Russian bombings.\"\n\nThe State Department responded with a redacted copy of a cable from the U.S. embassy in Moscow. According to the cable, on 24 March 2000, a former member of Russian intelligence services told a U.S. diplomat that the real story about the Ryazan incident could never be known because it \"would destroy the country.\" The informant said the FSB had \"a specially trained team of men\" whose mission was \"to carry out this type of urban warfare\". The informant has also said that Viktor Cherkesov, the FSB's first deputy director and an interrogator of Soviet dissidents was \"exactly the right person to order and carry out such actions.\"\n\nDavid Satter made a renewed FOIA request, and on 22 March 2017, State Department responded that documents concerning the U.S. assessment of the bombings would remain secret. A draft Vaughn index, a document used by agencies to justify withholdings in FOIA cases, said that the release of that information had \"the potential to inject friction into or cause serious damage\" to relationships with the Russian Government that were \"vital to U.S. national security\".\n\nOn 16 March 2018, the case Satter v. Department of Justice was closed.\n\n== Books and films ==\nThe theory of Russian government involvement appears in books and movies on the subject.\n\n=== Documentaries ===\nDavid Satter, a senior fellow of the Hudson Institute, authored two books Darkness at Dawn: The Rise of the Russian Criminal State and The Less You Know, The Better You Sleep: Russia's Road to Terror and Dictatorship under Yeltsin and Putin (published by Yale University Press in 2003 and 2016) where he scrutinized the events and came to the conclusion that the bombings were organized by Russian state security services.\n\nIn 2002, former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko and historian Yuri Felshtinsky published a book Blowing up Russia: Terror from within. According to authors the bombings and other terrorist acts have been committed by Russian security services to justify the Second Chechen War and to bring Vladimir Putin to power.\n\nIn another book, Lubyanka Criminal Group, Litvinenko and Alexander Goldfarb described the transformation of the FSB into a criminal and terrorist organization, including conducting the bombings.  Former GRU analyst and historian Viktor Suvorov said that the book describes \"a leading criminal group that provides \"protection\" for all other organized crime in the country and which continues the criminal war against their own people\", like their predecessors NKVD and KGB. He added: \"The book proves: Lubyanka [the KGB headquarters] was taken over by enemies of the people... If Putin's team can not disprove the facts provided by Litvinenko, Putin must shoot himself. Patrushev and all other leadership of Lubyanka Criminal Group must follow his example.\"\n\nAlexander Goldfarb and Marina Litvinenko published a book Death of a Dissident. They asserted that the murder of Mr. Litvinenko was \"the most compelling proof\" of the FSB involvement theory.  According to the book, the murder of Litvinenko \"gave credence to all his previous theories, delivering justice for the tenants of the bombed apartment blocks, the Moscow theater-goers, Sergei Yushenkov, Yuri Shchekochikhin, and Anna Politkovskaya, and the half-exterminated nation of Chechnya, exposing their killers for the whole world to see.\"\n\nA documentary film Assassination of Russia was made in 2000 by two French producers who had previously worked on NTV's Sugar of Ryazan program. Sergei Markov, director of the Political Research Institute in Moscow, criticised the film as \"a well-made professional example of the propagandist and psychological war\", dismissing its accusations as a conspiracy theory and comparing them to 9\/11 conspiracy theories.\n\nA documentary Nedoverie (\"Disbelief\") about the bombing controversy made by Russian director Andrei Nekrasov was premiered at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival. The film chronicles the story of Tatyana and Alyona Morozova, the two Russian-American sisters, who had lost their mother in the attack, and decided to find out who did it. His next film on the subject was Rebellion: the Litvinenko Case. The film doesn't intend to investigate the Litvinenko murder, rather than that, its goal is to put the case into a wider context of the events unfolding in post-Soviet Russia.\n\n=== Fiction ===\nWriter Alexander Prokhanov authored a prize-winning and best-selling political thriller Mr. Hexogen, published in 2002, which described the bombings as a \"chekist electoral technique\". Librarian of Congress James H. Billington referred to Prokhanov's novel as a continuation of a downward spiral in the Russian literature of the time. The plot of Mr. Hexogen has been likened to a nested doll of conspiracies within conspiracies. According to the plot, the apartment bombings have been staged by KGB agents, probably at the behest of the Jewish oligarchs, whose ultimate goal was to take power and move Russians to the Arctic while selling the organs of the healthy to Israel. Billington described the book as a \"merciless, anti-Semitic, surrealistic gloss on Moscow politics in the 1990s\".\n\nYuli Dubov, author of The Big Slice, wrote a novel The Lesser Evil, based on the bombings.

{"title":"1999 Tashkent bombings","article":"The 1999 Tashkent bombings occurred on 16 February when six car bombs exploded in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan. The bombs exploded over the course of an hour and a half, and targeted multiple government buildings. It is possible that five of the explosions were a distraction from the sixth, which appeared to be an attempt to assassinate President Islam Karimov. 16 were killed, and over 120 injured.\n\nAlthough the government blamed Islamic rebels - the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) - critics have cast doubt on this assessment.\n\nBecause of the tight media control in the country, the sequence of events of the attacks is not totally clear.\n\n==The attacks==\nAccording to the official version of the attacks, four to five men drove a car full of explosives up to the main entrance to the Cabinet of Ministers building a few minutes before Karimov was due to speak there. The attackers left the scene. A separate car explosion and gunfight occurred a few hundred meters away, distracting the guards. The attackers fled the scene.\n\n==Investigation==\n\nAccording to the Federal Security Service, the bombings utilized a mechanical mixture of aluminium powder and ammonia nitrate as the explosive. The terrorists have received instruction in training centers run by Khattab and Basayev in Chechnya.\n\n==Government response==\nTwo hours after the explosion, President Karimov and the heads of the Uzbek security forces declared that Islamic militants were responsible. Many individuals were arrested, with estimates ranging from the hundreds to up to 5,000. Human rights groups have criticized the detentions as illegitimate. They have also accused the government of planting evidence and getting confessions through torture.\n\nIn January 2000, on the eve of the Muslim holiday of Ramadan, the government announced the execution of several of the alleged participants in the attacks.\n\nThe Uzbek government also accused Tajikistan of being complicit in the attacks, and temporarily closed its border with the country in response.\n\n==Possible perpetrators==\nAlthough the government has blamed the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), an Islamist terrorist organization, for the attacks, critics have doubted this. Some have cast blame on Russia, although others have called this unlikely. Another possibility is that forces in the majority-Muslim Tajikistan government were retaliating for Uzbek support for Tajik opposition groups. Tajik terrorist groups have been suggested as well, especially the United Tajik Opposition (UTO).\n\nOthers have even suggested that the government itself was responsible, or that competing \"clans\", whose share of power in the government had recently been cut, were behind the attacks. In particular it has been suggested that the National Security Service, allegedly controlled by the Tashkent clan, was involved.\n\n==Aftermath==\nCritics have said that the Karimov regime used the attacks as an excuse to crack down on religious and, to a lesser extent, secular dissent. The attacks also showed how vulnerable the country was to terrorism and instability. Jaslyk Prison was opened in 1999 to hold thousands arrested following the bombings.\n\n==References==\n\n\n\n==Bibliography==\n*\n*","urls":["http:\/\/www.fsb.ru\/fsb\/press\/message\/single.htm%21id%3D10407754%40fsbMessage.html","http:\/\/www.rferl.org\/featuresarticle\/2005\/04\/51d08217-f03f-4906-9cc7-6224a3cff08b.html]","http:\/\/www.rferl.org\/a\/uzbekistans-house-of-torture\/24667200.html"]}
{"title":"Russian apartment bombings","article":"The Russian apartment bombings were a series of explosions that hit four apartment blocks in the Russian cities of Buynaksk, Moscow and Volgodonsk in September 1999, killing more than 300, injuring more than 1000, and spreading a wave of fear across the country. The kidnapping of Gennady Shpigun by Chechen rebels in March 1999, the Invasion of Dagestan in August 1999, together with the September bombings triggered the Second Chechen War. Vladimir Putin\u2019s handling of the crisis boosted his popularity greatly and helped him attain the presidency within a few months.\n\nThe blasts hit Buynaksk on 4 September and in Moscow on 9 and 13 September. On 13 September, Russian Duma speaker Gennadiy Seleznyov made an announcement in the Duma about receiving a report that another bombing had just happened in the city of Volgodonsk. A bombing did indeed happen in Volgodonsk, but only three days later, on 16 September. Chechen militants were blamed for the bombings, but denied responsibility, along with Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov.\n\nA suspicious device resembling those used in the bombings was found and defused in an apartment block in the Russian city of Ryazan on 22 September. The next day, Vladimir Putin praised the vigilance of the inhabitants of Ryazan and ordered the air bombing of Grozny, which marked the beginning of the Second Chechen War. Three FSB agents who had planted the devices at Ryazan were arrested by the local police. On 24 September 1999, head of FSB Nikolay Patrushev announced that the incident in Ryazan had been an anti-terror drill and the device found there contained only sugar.\n\nThe official Russian investigation of the Buinaksk bombing was completed in 2000, while the investigation of Moscow and Volgodonsk bombings was completed in 2002. In 2000, seven people were convicted of perpetrating the Buinaksk attack. According to the court ruling on the Moscow and Volgodonsk bombings, which was announced in 2004, the attacks were organised and led by Achemez Gochiyaev, who remains at large. All bombings were ordered by Islamist warlords Ibn Al-Khattab and Abu Omar al-Saif, who have been killed. Five other suspects have been killed and six have been convicted by Russian courts on terrorism-related charges.\n\nParliament member Yuri Shchekochikhin filed two motions for a parliamentary investigation of the events, but the motions were rejected by the Russian Duma in March 2000. An independent public commission to investigate the bombings was chaired by Duma deputy Sergei Kovalev. The commission was rendered ineffective because of government refusal to respond to its inquiries. Two key members of the Kovalev Commission, Sergei Yushenkov and Yuri Shchekochikhin, have since died in apparent assassinations. The Commission\u2019s lawyer and investigator Mikhail Trepashkin was arrested and served four years in prison for revealing state secrets. Former agent Alexander Litvinenko, who blamed FSB for the bombings in two books, was poisoned by FSB agents in London in 2006.\n\nAccording to some historians, the bombings were coordinated by the Russian state security services to bring Putin into the presidency. This view was justified by a number of suspicious events, most notably, the Ryazan incident.\n\nSome experts are critical of that theory, however. Journalists Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan believe that the Ryazan incident was actually a training exercise by the FSB. Former U.S. official Strobe Talbott has pointed out the absence of evidence for the conspiracy theory. Academic Robert Bruce Ware argued that the simplest explanation for the apartment block blasts is that they were indeed perpetrated by Islamist extremists.\n\n\n\n== Bombings ==\n\n=== Overview ===\nFive apartment bombings took place and at least three attempted bombings were prevented. All bombings had the same \"signature\", judging from the nature and the volume of the destruction. In each case a powerful explosive was used, and the timers were set to go off at night and inflict the maximum number of civilian casualties. The explosives were placed to destroy the weakest, most critical elements of the buildings and force the buildings to \"collapse like a house of cards\". The individuals behind the bombings were able to obtain or manufacture several tons of powerful explosives and deliver them to numerous destinations across Russia.\n\n=== Moscow mall ===\nOn 31 August 1999, at 20:00 local time, an explosion took place in \"Okhotny Ryad\" shopping centre on Manezhnaya Square, Moscow. One person was killed and 40 others injured. According to the FSB, the explosion had been caused by a very small bomb of only about 300 gram of explosives. On 2 September 1999, an unknown person called and claimed that the bombing was committed by the nonexistent militant organization \"Liberation Army of Dagestan\".\n\n=== Buynaksk, Dagestan ===\nOn 4 September 1999, at 22:00, a car bomb detonated outside a five-story apartment building in the city of Buynaksk in Dagestan, near the border of Chechnya. The building was housing Russian border guard soldiers and their families. Sixty-four people were killed and 133 were injured in the explosion. Another car bomb was found and defused in the same town. The defused bomb was in a car containing  of explosives. It was discovered by local residents in a parking lot surrounded by an army hospital and residential buildings.\n\n=== Moscow, Pechatniki ===\n\n\nOn 9 September 1999, shortly after midnight local time, at 20:00 GMT, a bomb detonated on the ground floor of an apartment building in southeast Moscow (19 Guryanova Street). The explosive power was equivalent to  of TNT. The nine-story building was destroyed, killing 106 people inside (with early reports giving 93 dead) and injuring 249 others, and damaging 19 nearby buildings. A total of 108 apartments were destroyed during the bombing. An FSB spokesman announced that traces of RDX and TNT were found on items removed from the site of the explosion. Residents said a few minutes before the blast four men were seen speeding away from the building in a car.\n\nRussian President Boris Yeltsin ordered the search of 30,000 residential buildings in Moscow for explosives. He took personal control of the investigation of the blast. Putin declared 13 September a day of mourning for the victims of the attacks.\n\n=== Moscow, Kashirskoye highway ===\n\nOn 13 September 1999, at 05:00, a large bomb exploded in a basement of an apartment block on Kashirskoye Highway in southern Moscow, about  from the place of the last attack. This was the deadliest blast in the chain of bombings (because the house was built with brick), with 119 people killed and 200 injured. The eight-story building was flattened, littering the street with debris and throwing some concrete pieces hundreds of meters away.\n\n=== Moscow, prevented bombings ===\nOn 13 September, the police has found and defused another bomb in an apartment block on Borisovskiye Prudy street in Moscow.\n\nApart from the police measures, citizen patrols helped foil additional bombings in Moscow. According to Irina Svyatenko, a Moscow City Parliament member,\n\n\n=== Volgodonsk ===\n\nA truck bomb exploded on 16 September 1999, outside a nine-story apartment complex in the southern Russian city of Volgodonsk, killing 17 people and injuring 69. The bombing took place at 5:57 am. Surrounding buildings were also damaged. The blast also happened  from a nuclear power plant. Prime Minister Putin signed a decree calling on law enforcement and other agencies to develop plans within three days to protect industry, transportation, communications, food processing centres and nuclear complexes.\n\n=== Ryazan incident ===\nAt 20:30 on 22 September 1999, Alexei Kartofelnikov, a resident of an apartment building in the city of Ryazan noticed two suspicious men who carried sacks into the basement from a car. While the license plate indicated that the car was registered in Moscow, a sheet of paper was taped over the last two digits, and the number written on it implied that the car was local.\n\nKartofelnikov alerted the police, but by the time they arrived the car and the men were gone. The policemen found three sacks of white powder in the basement, each weighing . A detonator and a timing device were attached to the sacks. The detonator was a 12-gauge shotgun shell filled with powder. The timer was set to 5:30 AM. Yuri Tkachenko, the head of the local bomb squad, disconnected the detonator and the timer.  Reportedly, Tkachenko tested the three sacks of white substance with a \"MO-2\" gas analyser, which detected RDX vapors.\n\nInhabitants of the apartment building were evacuated. According to David Satter, residents of neighboring buildings fled their homes in terror, to the effect that nearly 30,000 residents spent the night on the street. Police and rescue vehicles converged from different parts of the city. As many as 1,200 local police officers were put on alert, the railroad stations and the airport were surrounded, and roadblocks were set up on highways leaving the city.\n\nAt 01:30 on  23 September 1999, the explosive engineers took a bit of substance from the suspicious-looking sacks to a firing ground located about  away from Ryazan for testing. During the substance tests at that area they tried to explode it by means of a detonator, but their efforts failed, the substance was not detonated, and the explosion did not occur. At 05:00, Radio Rossiya reported about the attempted bombing, noting that the bomb was set up to go off at 05:30. In the morning, Ryazan resembled a city under siege. Composite sketches of three suspected terrorists, two men and a woman, were posted everywhere in the city and shown on TV. At 08:00 Russian television reported the attempt to blow out the building in Ryazan and identified the explosive used in the bomb as RDX. Vladimir Rushailo announced later that police prevented a terrorist act. A news report at 16:00 reported that the explosives failed to detonate during their testing outside the city.\n\nAt 19:00, Vladimir Putin praised the vigilance of the inhabitants of Ryazan, and called for the air bombing of the Chechen capital Grozny in response to the terrorism acts. He said:\n\n\nOn 23 September Natalia Yukhnova, a telephone service employee in Ryazan, tapped into a suspicious phone call to Moscow and overheard the following instruction: \"Leave one at a time, there are patrols everywhere\". The called number was traced to a telephone exchange unit serving FSB offices.\n\nWhen arrested, the detainees produced FSB identification cards. They were soon released on orders from Moscow.\n\nOn 24 September, FSB director Nikolai Patrushev announced that it was an exercise that was being carried out to test responses after the earlier blasts.\n\nThe Ryazan FSB \"reacted with fury\" and issued a statement saying: \n\n\nFSB also issued a public apology about the incident. In a show \"Independent Investigation\" on NTV, Evgeniy Savostyanov, former director of Moscow and Moscow Oblast regional FSB branch, has criticized the FSB for performing such exercise on residential buildings with inhabitants inside and without notifying local authorities.\n\n==== Explosives in Ryazan controversy ====\nThe position of Russian authorities on the Ryazan incident changed significantly over time. Initially, it was declared by the FSB and federal government to be a real threat. However, after the people who planted the bomb were identified, the official version changed to \"security training\".\n\nIn February 2000, Novaya Gazeta journalist Pavel Voloshin has published an essay What happened in Ryazan: Sugar or Hexogen?, that was partly based on his two-hour long interview with Yuri Tkachenko, the police explosives expert who defused the Ryazan bomb. The essay noted that it's well known that a gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that he was completely certain that the instrument was in correct working order. The gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, making frequent prophylactic checks, because the device contained a radioactive source. Meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. Speaking of the detonator, Voloshin noted that people who disarmed the device (Tkachenko and his bomb squad) claimed that the detonator attached to the sacks was not a dummy and had been prepared on a professional level. The police warrant officer who answered the original call and discovered the bomb insisted that there were no doubts it was a combat situation.\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the Security Agency Worker\u2019s Day in December 2001, Tkachenko said that a gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a shotgun shell that couldn't detonate any known explosives.\n\nIn February 2003, Kommersant journalist Olga Allenova has studied the criminal investigation file on the Ryazan incident, obtained by Russian State Duma member Sergei Kovalev. According to the proceedings, a bomb disposal expert who arrived to the scene has twice performed a test which didn't show the presence of explosive particles. The head of the bomb squad Tkachenko, who arrived soon after that, made a test himself and found the RDX. The investigator who questioned Yuri Tkachenko concluded that the detection of RDX was made possible by contamination of Yuri Tkachenko's hands, since the latter worked with explosives containing RDX on the day before the incident without wearing sterile gloves. Another detail concerned the type of a device used to detect the explosives. The report submitted by the Ryazan UFSB claimed that gas analyser \"M-02\" was used. However, during Tkachenko's questioning it was revealed that he had used the device \"Exprel\" for the analysis. The investigation has resolved the contradiction in the following way. The bomb squad in Ryazan is equipped with the gas analyser \"\u041c-02\", but the latter has certain limitations. The device has a high degree of imprecision, and the analysis takes a long time. So, the bomb squad used the device \"Exprel\", which is more robust, accurate and easy to use. But since they were not supposed to possess that device, the bomb squad has submitted the paperwork which showed that the gas analyser \"M-02\" had been used.\n\nIn March 2000, head of the Ryazan UFSB General Sergeyev appeared on TV show \"Independent Investigation\" commenting on the device used to detect the RDX. According to Sergeyev, it was packed in a briefcase and acted like a litmus test from school. The substance to be investigated was wiped by a collection paper, which was subsequently sprayed from an aerosol can. A change of the paper color indicated the presence of explosives. Sergeyev explained the false positive result by prior contamination of the lid of the briefcase, on which Tkachenko poured some sugar from the sacks to perform the test.\n\n==== The case of private Alexei Pinyaev ====\n\nIn March 2000, Novaya Gazeta journalist Pavel Voloshin reported the account of Private Alexei P. (later identified as Pinyaev) of the 137th Regiment. Pinyaev guarded a storehouse with weapons and ammunition near the city of Ryazan. Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \"sugar\" on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander. He consulted a sapper, who identified the substance as hexogen.\n\nAccording to Felshtinsky and Pribylovsky, after the newspaper report FSB officers descended on Pinyayev\u2019s unit, accused them of divulging a state secret and told them, \"You guys can't even imagine what serious business you\u2019ve got yourselves tangled up in.\" The regiment later sued publishers of Novaya Gazeta for insulting the honour of the Russian Army, since there was no Private Alexei Pinyayev in the regiment, according to their statement.\n\nA report aired by ORT in March 2000 and created by journalist Leonid Grozin and operator Dmitry Vishnevoy has accused Novaya Gazeta of lying. According to Grozin and Vishnevoy, there is no storehouse at the test range of the 137th Regiment. Alexei Pinyaev has admitted meeting with Pavel Voloshin, but claimed that he was merely asked to confirm a pre-conceived story.\n\nAt a FSB press conference in 2001, Private Pinyayev stated that there was no hexogen in the 137th Airborne Regiment and that he was hospitalised in December 1999 and no longer visited the test range.\n\n===Explosives in the apartment bombings===\n\nAfter the bombing at Guryanova Street on September 9, the Moscow FSB reported that items removed from the scene showed traces of TNT and RDX (or \"hexogen\").\n\nLater FSB declared that the explosive used in the bombings was a mixture of aluminium powder, ammonium nitrate, TNT and sugar prepared by the perpetrators in a concrete mixer at a fertiliser factory in Urus-Martan, Chechnya. Also, each bomb contained some plastic explosive used as an explosive booster.\n\nRDX is produced in only one factory in Russia, in the city of Perm. According to David Satter, the FSB changed the story about the type of explosive, since it was difficult to explain how huge amounts of RDX disappeared from the closely guarded Perm facility.\n\nAccording to Satter, all four bombings that occurred had a similar \"signature\" which indicated that the explosives had been carefully prepared, a mark of skilled specialists. There is also no explanation as to how the terrorists were able to obtain tons of hexogen explosive and transport it to various locations in Russia; hexogen is produced in one plant in Perm Oblast for which the central FSB is responsible for the security. The culprits would also have needed to organise nine explosions (the four that occurred and the five attempted bombings reported by the authorities) in different cities in a two-week period. Satter's estimate for the time required for target plan development, site visits, explosives preparation, renting space at the sites and transporting explosives to the sites was four to four and a half months.\n\nAccording to Lieutenant General of the FSB Ivan Mironov, the precise composition of the explosive mixture was hard to determine, because no visible traces remain after the aluminium powder is consumed in a blast. Mironov credited Abu Omar with developing the technology of explosions, which was taught to perpetrators in training camps near Serzhen-Yurt and Urus-Martan. The explosive mixture was relatively easy to produce, while some components could be obtained pretty much from a kitchen.\n\n===Controversy over the prevented bombings===\nAccording to Russian newspaper Kommersant and the public relations centre of the FSB, further bombings in Moscow were prevented with the help of a real estate agent who called the police after the second bombing in Moscow and told it about his client, who rented basements in the two buildings which were blown up in Moscow. The client was identified as Achemez Gochiyaev.\n\nAccording to Litvinenko, Felshtinsky and Goldfarb, on 13 September 1999, Achemez Gochiyaev called and reported about bombs planted in several locations. Gochiyaev claimed that he was framed by his old acquaintance, an FSB officer who asked him to rent basements \"as storage facilities\" at four locations where bombs were later found. After the second explosion on Kashirskoe highway Gochiyaev recognized he was set up, called the police and told them about the basements of two other buildings at Borisovskie Prudy and Kopotnya, where the explosives were actually found and explosions averted.\n\nIvan Mironov, a lieutenant general of the FSB, has accused Gochiyaev of lying.\n\n== Related events ==\n\n=== Law on Freedom of Movement ===\n\nIn 1993, the Supreme Soviet of Russia adopted the \"Law on Freedom of Movement and Freedom of Choice of Residence\", which abolished the propiska system. Under the new law, no official authorization to live in a certain place was needed.\n\nYuri Luzhkov, a mayor of Moscow at the time of the bombings, believed that while the bombings in Moscow were caused by unresolved problems of 1990s in Russia, authors of that liberal law have torpedoed Moscow. The law made it possible for Chechen terrorists to bring weapons to Moscow and store them there, as well as purchase auto vehicles and provide housing for tens of bandits who had arrived in Moscow. According to Luzhkov, \"for three months, after having arrived in Moscow, a terrorist could live wherever he wanted and stay with anyone, without notifying the police\", which allowed the criminals to prepare the bombings.\n\n=== War of Dagestan ===\n\nOn 7 August 1999, an Islamist group, led by Shamil Basayev and Ibn al-Khattab, invaded the Russian republic of Dagestan.\n\n=== Advanced warnings about the impending bombings ===\nIn July 1999, Russian journalist Aleksandr Zhilin, writing in the Moskovskaya pravda, warned that there would be terrorist attacks in Moscow organised by the government. Using a leaked Kremlin document as evidence, he added that the motive would be to undermine the opponents of the Russian President Boris Yeltsin. These included Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov and former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov. However, this warning was ignored.\n\nAccording to Amy Knight, \"even more significant is the fact that a respected and influential Duma deputy, Konstantin Borovoi, was told on September 9, the day of the first Moscow apartment bombing, that there was to be a terrorist attack in the city. His source was an officer of the Russian military intelligence (GRU). Borovoy transmitted this information to FSB officials serving on Yeltsin's Security Council, but he was ignored.\"\n\nOn 13 September 1999, Novaya Gazeta published a report by retired army major Vyacheslav Izmailov, which said that the editorial board of Novaya gazeta had received information about the planned terrorist attacks from its sources in Chechnya. According to the report, terrorist attacks were organized by Ibn Al-Khattab, Shamil Basayev and Shirvani Basayev, who sent groups of terrorists to Dagestan, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Rostov and, possibly, other cities. In a follow-up article published on 20 September 1999, Izmailov revealed that Novaya Gazeta had received the information on 8 September, twelve hours before the bombing on Guryanova street in Moscow, and immediately relayed it to the Chief Directorate Combating Organized Crime of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. According to Izmailov, as many as 10 terrorist attacks have been planned.\n\n=== Announcement of impending Volgodonsk bombings in the Russian Duma ===\nOn 13 September, just hours after the second explosion in Moscow, Russian Duma speaker Gennadiy Seleznyov of the Communist Party made an announcement, \"I have just received a report. According to information from Rostov-on-Don, an apartment building in the city of Volgodonsk was blown up last night.\" When the Volgodonsk bombing happened on 16 September, Vladimir Zhirinovsky demanded the following day an explanation in the Duma, but Seleznyov turned his microphone off. Vladimir Zhirinovsky said in the Russian Duma: \"Remember, Gennadiy Nikolaevich, how you told us that an apartment block has been blown up in Volgodonsk, three days prior to the blast? How should we interpret this? The State Duma knows that the apartment block was destroyed on Monday, and it has indeed been blown up on Thursday [same week]...\"\n\nAlexander Litvinenko believed that someone had mixed up the order of the blasts, \"the usual Kontora mess up\". According to Litvinenko, \"Moscow-2 was on the 13th and Volgodonsk on 16th, but they got it to the speaker the other way around\". Investigator Mikhail Trepashkin confirmed that the man who gave Seleznyov the note was indeed an FSB officer.\n\nIn an August 2017 interview with Yuri Dud, Vladimir Zhirinovsky suggested that the FSB had information that a terrorist attack in Volgodonsk was being prepared and relayed that to Seleznyov. However, due to a quite tense atmosphere in Russia at the time, the person responsible for relaying the message made a mistake, and Seleznyov was told that the attack in Volgodonsk had already occurred. Zhirinovsky denied the possibility that the bombing could be perpetrated by the FSB, citing the lack of utility, but claimed that the FSB could know about possible sites of terrorist attacks. That would be major cities, Rostov Oblast was at risk because of its proximity to the Caucasus, and Volgodonsk could be a site of an attack because of its nuclear power plant.\n\n=== Sealing of all materials by the Russian Duma ===\nThe Russian Duma rejected two motions for parliamentary investigation of the Ryazan incident. In the Duma a pro-Kremlin party Unity, voted to seal all materials related to the Ryazan incident for the next 75 years and forbade an investigation into what happened.\n\n=== Claims and denials of responsibility for the blasts ===\nOn 9 September, an anonymous person, speaking with a Caucasian accent, phoned the Interfax news agency, saying that the blasts in Moscow and Buynaksk were \"our response to the bombings of civilians in the villages in Chechnya and Dagestan.\"\n\nOn 15 September, an unidentified man, again speaking with a Caucasian accent, called the ITAR-TASS news agency, claiming to represent a group called the Liberation Army of Dagestan. He said that the explosions in Buynaksk and Moscow were carried out by his organisation. According to him, the attacks were a retaliation to the deaths of Muslim women and children during Russian air raids in Dagestan. \"We will answer death with death,\" the caller said. Russian officials from both the Interior Ministry and FSB, at the time, expressed scepticism over the claims and said there is no such organization  On 15 September 1999, a Dagestani official also denied the existence of a \"Dagestan Liberation Army\".\n\nIn an interview published in Lidove Noviny on September 9, Shamil Basayev denied responsibility for the bombings and said that it had been the work of Dagestanis. According to Basayev, the bombings were a retribution for the military operation of the Russian Army against \"three small villages\" in Dagestan. In subsequent interviews, Basayev said he didn't know who perpetrated the bombings.\n\nIn the interview with Associated Press held between 9 September and 13 September, and published on 14 September, Ibn al-Khattab said that \"From now on they will get our bombs everywhere. Let Russia await our explosions blasting through their cities. I swear we will do it.\" However, in a subsequent interview on 14 September to the Interfax agency in Grozny, Khattab denied responsibility for the bombings.\n\nChechen Foreign Ministry issued an official statement on 14 September condemning Moscow blasts, and affirming that \"Ichkeria stands firmly against terrorism in any manifestation\".\n\n== Russia's Internal Investigations ==\n\n=== Criminal investigation and court ruling ===\nIn 2000, investigation of the Buynaksk attack was complete and seven people were convicted of the bombing.\n\nRussia's pre-trial investigation of the Moscow and Volgodonsk bombings was finished in 2002. According to the Russian State Prosecutor office, all apartment bombings were executed under command of ethnic Karachay Achemez Gochiyayev and planned by Ibn al-Khattab and Abu Omar al-Saif, Arab militants fighting in Chechnya on the side of Chechen insurgents. Al-Khattab and al-Saif were killed during the Second Chechen War. According to investigators, the explosives were prepared at a fertiliser factory in Urus-Martan Chechnya, by \"mixing aluminium powder, nitre and sugar in a concrete mixer\", or by also putting there RDX and TNT. From there they were sent to a food storage facility in Kislovodsk, which was managed by an uncle of one of the terrorists, Yusuf Krymshakhalov. Another conspirator, Ruslan Magayayev, leased a KamAZ truck in which the sacks were stored for two months. After everything was planned, the participants were organised into several groups which then transported the explosives to different cities.\n\nAccording to investigators, the explosion in Moscow mall on 31 August was committed by another man, Magomed-Zagir Garzhikaev on the orders from Shamil Basayev, according to the FSB.\n\nCourt hearings on the Moscow and Volgodonsk attacks were held behind closed doors, and were completed in 2004. The process has produced 90 volumes of proceedings, 5 of which were classified.\n\n==== Court rulings ====\nAccording to the court ruling, Al-Khattab paid Gochiyayev $500,000 to carry out the attacks at Guryanova Street, Kashirskoye Highway, and Borisovskiye Prudy, and then helped to hide Gochiyayev and his accomplices in Chechnya. In early September 1999, Magayayev, Krymshamkhalov, Batchayev and Dekkushev reloaded the cargo into a Mercedes-Benz 2236 trailer and delivered it to Moscow. En route, they were protected from possible complications by an accomplice, Khakim Abayev, who accompanied the trailer in another car. In Moscow they were met by Achemez Gochiyayev, who registered in Hotel Altai under the fake name \"Laipanov\", and Denis Saitakov. The explosives were left in a warehouse in Ulitsa Krasnodonskaya, which was leased by pseudo-Laipanov (Gochiyayev). The next day, the explosives were delivered in \"ZIL-5301\" vans to three addresses\u2014Ulitsa Guryanova, Kashirskoye Shosse and Ulitsa Borisovskiye Prudy, where pseudo-Laipanov leased cellars. Gochiyayev supervised the placement of the bombs in the rented cellars. Next followed the explosions at the former two addresses. The explosion at 16 Borisovskiye Prudy was prevented.\n\nAccording to the court, 4 September Buinaksk bombing was ordered by Al-Khattab. Reportedly, since the perpetrators have managed to explode only one truck bomb instead of the two, Khattab called it a \"botched job\" and paid $300,000 for it, which was a part of the sum he originally promised. One of the suspects confessed having loaded the trucks with sacks in Buynaksk, but claimed he did not know what they were intended for.\n\nThe explosion in the mall on Manezhnaya Square was the subject of a separate court process held in Moscow in 2009. The court accused Khalid Khuguyev and Magumadzir Gadzhikayev of organisation and execution of the 1999 explosions in the Manezhnaya Square mall and in hotel Intourist and sentenced them to 25 years and 15 years of imprisonment, correspondingly.\n\n==== Sentences ====\n and  have both been sentenced to life terms in a special regime colony. Both defendants have pleaded guilty only to some of the charges. For instance, Dekkushev acknowledged that he knew the explosives he transported were to be used for an act of terror. Dekkushev also confirmed Gochiyaev's role in the attacks. Dekkushev was extradited to Russia on 14 April 2002 to stand trial. Krymshakhalov was apprehended and extradicted to Moscow. Achemez Gochiyaev, the head of the group that carried out the attacks and allegedly the main organiser, remains a fugitive, and is under an international search warrant. In a statement released in January 2004, the FSB said, \"until we arrest Gochiyayev, the case [of the apartment block bombings of 1999] will not be closed.\"\n\n==== Suspects and accused ====\nIn September 1999, hundreds of Chechen nationals (out of the more than 100,000 permanently living in Moscow) were briefly detained and interrogated in Moscow, as a wave of anti-Chechen sentiments swept the city. All of them turned out to be innocent.\n\nAccording to the official investigation, the following people either delivered explosives, stored them, or harboured other suspects:\n\n===== Moscow bombings =====\n* Ibn al-Khattab (a Saudi-born Mujahid), who was poisoned by the FSB in 2002.\n* Achemez Gochiyayev (an ethnic Karachai, has not been arrested; he is still at large)\n* Denis Saitakov (an ethnic Tatar from Uzbekistan), killed in Georgia in 1999\u20132000\n* Khakim Abayev (an ethnic Karachai), killed by FSB special forces in May 2004 in Ingushetia\n* Ravil Akhmyarov (a Russian citizen), Surname indicates an ethnic Tatar, killed in Chechnya in 1999\u20132000\n* Yusuf Krymshamkhalov (an ethnic Karachai and resident of Kislovodsk), arrested in Georgia in December 2002, extradited to Russia and sentenced to life imprisonment in January 2004, after a two-month secret trial held without a jury\n* Stanislav Lyubichev (a traffic police inspector, resident of Kislovodsk, Stavropol Krai), who helped the truck with explosives pass the checkpoint after getting a sack of sugar as a bribe, sentenced to four years in May 2003\n\n===== Volgodonsk bombing =====\n* Timur Batchayev (an ethnic Karachai), killed in Georgia in the clash with police during which Krymshakhalov was arrested\n* Zaur Batchayev (an ethnic Karachai) killed in Chechnya in 1999\u20132000\n* Adam Dekkushev (an ethnic Karachai), arrested in Georgia, threw a grenade at police during the arrest, extradited to Russia and sentenced to life imprisonment in January 2004, after a two-month secret trial held without a jury\n\n===== Buinaksk bombing =====\n* Isa Zainutdinov (an ethnic Avar) and native of Dagestan, sentenced to life imprisonment in March 2001\n* Alisultan Salikhov (an ethnic Avar) and native of Dagestan, sentenced to life imprisonment in March 2001\n* Magomed Salikhov (an ethnic Avar) and native of Dagestan, arrested in Azerbaijan in November 2004, extradited to Russia, found not guilty on the charge of terrorism by the jury on 24 January 2006; found guilty of participating in an armed force and illegal crossing of the national border, he was retried again on the same charges on 13 November 2006 and again found not guilty, this time on all charges, including the ones he was found guilty of in the first trial. According to Kommersant Salikhov admitted that he made a delivery of paint to Dagestan for Ibn al-Khattab, although he was not sure what was really delivered.\n* Ziyavudin Ziyavudinov (a native of Dagestan), arrested in Kazakhstan, extradited to Russia, sentenced to 24 years in April 2002\n* Abdulkadyr Abdulkadyrov (an ethnic Avar) and native of Dagestan, sentenced to 9 years in March 2001\n* Magomed Magomedov (Sentenced to 9 years in March 2001)\n* Zainutdin Zainutdinov (an ethnic Avar) and native of Dagestan, sentenced to 3 years in March 2001 and immediately released under amnesty\n* Makhach Abdulsamedov (a native of Dagestan, sentenced to 3 years in March 2001 and immediately released under amnesty).\n\n=== Attempts at an independent investigation ===\nThe Russian Duma rejected two motions for a parliamentary investigation of the Ryazan incident.\n\nAn independent public commission to investigate the bombings was chaired by Duma deputy Sergei Kovalyov. The commission started its work in February 2002. On 5 March Sergei Yushenkov and Duma member Yuli Rybakov flew to London where they met Alexander Litvinenko and Mikhail Trepashkin. After this meeting, Trepashkin began working with the commission.\n\nHowever, the public commission was rendered ineffective because of government refusal to respond to its inquiries. Two key members of the Commission, Sergei Yushenkov and Yuri Shchekochikhin, both Duma members, have died in apparent assassinations in April 2003 and July 2003, respectively. Another member of the commission, Otto Lacis, was assaulted in November 2003 and two years later, on 3 November 2005, he died in a hospital after a car accident.\n\nThe commission asked lawyer Mikhail Trepashkin to investigate the case. Trepashkin claimed to have found that the basement of one of the bombed buildings was rented by FSB officer Vladimir Romanovich and that the latter was witnessed by several people. Trepashkin also investigated a letter attributed to Achemez Gochiyayev and found that the alleged assistant of Gochiyayev who arranged the delivery of sacks might have been Kapstroi-2000 vice president Alexander Karmishin, a resident of Vyazma.\n\nTrepashkin was unable to bring the alleged evidence to the court because he was arrested in October 2003 (on charges of illegal arms possession) and imprisoned in Nizhny Tagil, just a few days before he was to make his findings public. He was sentenced by a Moscow military closed court to four years imprisonment on a charge of revealing state secrets. Amnesty International issued a statement that \"there are serious grounds to believe that Mikhail Trepashkin was arrested and convicted under falsified criminal charges which may be politically motivated, in order to prevent him continuing his investigative and legal work related to the 1999 apartment bombings in Moscow and other cities\".\n\nIn a letter to Olga Konskaya, Trepashkin wrote that some time before the bombings, Moscow's Regional Directorate against Organized Crimes (RUOP GUVD) arrested several people for selling the explosive RDX. Following that, Nikolai Patrushev's Directorate of FSB officers came to the GUVD headquarters, captured evidence and ordered the investigators fired. Trepashkin wrote that he learned about the story at a meeting with several RUOP officers in the year 2000. They claimed that their colleagues could present eyewitness accounts in a court. They offered a videocassette with evidence against the RDX dealers. Mr Trepashkin did not publicise the meeting fearing for lives of the witnesses and their families.\n\nAccording to Trepashkin, his supervisors and the people from the FSB promised not to arrest him if he left the Kovalev commission and started working together with the FSB \"against Alexander Litvinenko\".\n\nOn 24 March 2000, two days before the presidential elections, NTV Russia featured the Ryazan events of Fall 1999 in the talk show Independent Investigation. The talk with the residents of the Ryazan apartment building along with FSB public relations director Alexander Zdanovich and Ryazan branch head Alexander Sergeyev was filmed few days earlier. On 26 March, Boris Nemtsov voiced his concern over the possible shut-down of NTV for airing the talk. Seven months later, NTV general manager  said at the JFK School of Government that Information Minister Mikhail Lesin warned him on several occasions.  Malashenko's recollection of Lesin's warning was that by airing the talk show NTV \"crossed the line\" and that the NTV managers were \"outlaws\" in the eyes of the Kremlin. According to Alexander Goldfarb, Mr. Malashenko told him that Valentin Yumashev brought a warning from the Kremlin, one day before airing the show, promising in no uncertain terms that the NTV managers \"should consider themselves finished\" if they went ahead with the broadcast.\n\nArtyom Borovik was among the people who investigated the bombings. He received numerous death threats and died in a suspicious plane crash in March 2000 that was regarded by Felshtinsky and Pribylovsky as a probable assassination.\n\nJournalist Anna Politkovskaya and former security service member Alexander Litvinenko, who investigated the bombings, were killed in 2006.\n\nSurviving victims of the Guryanova street bombing asked President Dmitry Medvedev to resume the official investigation in 2008, but it was not resumed.\n\nIn a 2017 discussion at the RFE\/RL Sergei Kovalyov said: \"I think that the Chechen trace was skilfully fabricated. No one from the people who organized the bombings was found, and no one actually was looking for them\". He then was asked by Vladimir Kara-Murza if he believes that several key members of his commission, and even Boris Berezovskiy and Boris Nemtsov who \"knew quite a few things about the bombings\" were killed to prevent the independent investigation. Kovalev responded: \"I cannot state with full confidence that the explosions were organized by the authorities. Although it's clear that the explosions were useful for them, useful for future President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, because he had just promised to \"waste in the outhouse\" (as he said) everyone who had any relation to terrorism. It was politically beneficial for him to scare people with terrorism. That is not proven. But what can be stated with full confidence is this: the investigation of both the Moscow explosions and the so-called \"exercises\" in Ryazan is trumped up. There can be various possibilities. It seems to me, that Ryazan should have been the next explosion, but I cannot prove that.\"\n\nAccording to Elena Pokalova, an expert in security issues, Kovalev's commission \"did not produce conclusive evidence to incriminate Russia's security services\".\n\n== Russian government involvement theory ==\nAccording to David Satter, Yuri Felshtinsky, Alexander Litvinenko, Vladimir Pribylovsky and Boris Kagarlitsky, the bombings were a successful coup d'\u00e9tat coordinated by the Russian state security services to win public support for a new full-scale war in Chechnya and to bring Putin to power. Some of them described the bombings as typical \"active measures\" practised by the KGB in the past. The war in Chechnya boosted Prime Minister and former FSB Director Vladimir Putin's popularity, and brought the pro-war Unity Party to the State Duma and Putin to the presidency within a few months.\n\nDavid Satter stated, during his testimony in the United States House of Representatives, that \"With Yeltsin and his family facing possible criminal prosecution, however, a plan was put into motion to put in place a successor who would guarantee that Yeltsin and his family would be safe from prosecution and the criminal division of property in the country would not be subject to reexamination. For \"Operation Successor\" to succeed, however, it was necessary to have a massive provocation. In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early. Putin was elected president and his first act was to guarantee Yeltsin immunity from prosecution.\"\n\nAccording to reconstruction of the events by Felshtinsky and Pribylovsky,\n* The bombings in Buynaksk were carried out by a team of twelve GRU officers who were sent to Dagestan and supervised by the head of GRU's 14th Directorate General Kostechenko. That version was partly based on a testimony by Aleksey Galkin. The bombing in Buynaksk was conducted by the GRU to avoid an \"interagency conflict between the FSB and the Ministry of Defense\".\n* In Moscow, Volgodonsk and Ryazan, the attacks were organized by the FSB through a chain of command that included director of the counter-terrorism department General German Ugryumov, FSB operatives Maxim Lazovsky, Vladimir Romanovich, Ramazan Dyshekov and others. Achemez Gochiyayev, Tatyana Korolyeva, and Alexander Karmishin rented warehouses that received shipments of hexogen disguised as sugar and possibly did not know that the explosives were delivered. \n* Adam Dekkushev, Krymshamkhalov, and Timur Batchayev were recruited by FSB agents who presented themselves as \"Chechen separatists\" to deliver explosives to Volgodonsk and Moscow.\n* Names and the fate of FSB agents who planted the bomb in the city of Ryazan remain unknown.\n\n=== Support ===\nHistorian Amy Knight wrote that it was \"abundantly clear\" that the FSB was responsible for carrying out the attacks and that Vladimir Putin's \"guilt seems clear,\" since it was inconceivable that the FSB would have done so without the sanction of Putin, the agency's former director and by then Prime Minister of Russia.\n\nDavid Satter considers the bombings as a political provocation by the Russian secret services that was similar to the burning of the Reichstag.\n\nIn 2003, U.S. senator John McCain said that \"It was during Mr. Putin's tenure as Prime Minister in 1999 that he launched the Second Chechen War following the Moscow apartment bombings. There remain credible allegations that Russia's FSB had a hand in carrying out these attacks. Mr. Putin ascended to the presidency in 2000 by pointing a finger at the Chechens for committing these crimes, launching a new military campaign in Chechnya, and riding a frenzy of public anger into office.\"\n\nFormer Russian State Security Council chief Alexandr Lebed in his 29 September 1999 interview with Le Figaro said he was almost convinced that the government organised the terrorist acts. Later Lebed's public relations staff claimed that he was quoted out of the context.\n\nAndrei Illarionov, a former key economic adviser to the Russian president, said that FSB involvement \"is not a theory, it is a fact. There is no other element that could have organized the bombings except for the FSB.\"\n\nA PBS Frontline documentary on Vladimir Putin also mentioned the theory and FSB involvement, citing the quick removal of rubble and bodies from the bombing scenes before any investigation could take place, the discovery of the Ryazan bomb, the deaths of several people who had attempted to investigate the bombings, as well as the defused Ryazan bomb being made of Russian military explosives and detonators.\n\nAccording to former KGB officer Konstantin Preobrazhensky, \"Litvinenko's accusations are not unfounded. Chechen rebels were incapable of organising a series of bombings without help from high-ranking Moscow officials.\"\n\nIn 2008, British journalist Edward Lucas concluded in his book The New Cold War: Putin's Russia and the Threat to the West that \"The weight of evidence so far supports the grimmest interpretation: that the attacks were a ruthlessly planned stunt to create a climate of panic and fear in which Putin would quickly become the country's indisputable leader, as indeed he did.\"\n\nIn the September 2009 issue of GQ, veteran war correspondent Scott Anderson wrote about on Putin's role in the Russian apartment bombings, based in part on his interviews with Mikhail Trepashkin The journal owner, Cond\u00e9 Nast, then took extreme measures to prevent an article by Anderson from appearing in the Russian media, both physically and in translation.\n\nIn her book Putin's Kleptocracy, historian Karen Dawisha summarized evidence related to the bombings and concluded that \"to blow up your own innocent and sleeping people in your capital city is an action almost unthinkable. Yet the evidence that the FSB was at least involved in planting a bomb in Ryazan is incontrovertible.\"\n\nAccording to Timothy Snyder, \"it seemed possible\" that the perpetrators of the apartment bombings were FSB officers.\n\n=== Criticism ===\nIn March 2000, Putin dismissed the allegations of FSB involvement in the bombings as \"delirious nonsense.\" \"There are no people in the Russian secret services who would be capable of such crime against their own people. The very allegation is immoral,\" he said. An FSB spokesman said that \"Litvinenko's evidence cannot be taken seriously by those who are investigating the bombings\".\n\nAccording to Strobe Talbott who was a United States Deputy Secretary of State during the events, \"there was no evidence to support\" the \"conspiracy theory, although Russian public opinion did indeed solidify behind Putin in his determination to carry out a swift, decisive counteroffensive.\" The U.S. believed that leaders of Chechen rebels had \"indisputably\u2014and, it seemed, deliberately\u2014brought down the wrath of the Russian armed forces on their people\". Therefore, the U.S. has limited its response to the Chechen conflict to urging Russia to follow its obligations under various international treaties to protect civilian life.\n\nAccording to historian Ren\u00e9 De La Pedraja, after the kidnapping of a high official of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Gennady Shpigun, in March 1999, the ministry developed a plan for a limited military campaign to occupy the northern third of Chechnya up to the Terek River valley. As the FSB chief, Putin strongly supported the Terek River Valley plan. As a prime minister, Putin showd every intention to respond to the Dagestan invasion with the original plan to occupy the northern third of Chechnya, while carrying out the original proposal on an accelerated schedule to provide a timely response to the attack. However, after terrorists perpetrated the apartment bombings, \"the usually cool and cautious Putin was swept away in the popular outrage\" and decided to approve a much more ambitious campaign to subdue all of Chechnya, while the Russian Army wasn't prepared to pursue that campaign.\n\nAccording to Russian investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov, \"From the start, it seemed that the Kremlin was determined to suppress all discussion ... When Alexander Podrabinek, a Russian human rights activist, tried to import copies of Litvinenko's and Felshtinsky's Blowing up Russia in 2003, they were confiscated by the FSB. Trepashkin himself, acting as a lawyer for two relatives of the victims of the blast, was unable to obtain information he requested and was entitled to see by law\". However, Soldatov believed that the obstruction might reflect \"\u201cparanoia\u201d rather than guilt on the part of the authorities\". Consequently, Soldatov argued, that paranoia has produced the very conspiracy theories that the Russian Government intended to eradicate.\n\nJournalists Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan in their 2010 book The New Nobility have expressed their conviction that the Ryazan incident had actually been a training exercise. According to the authors, such exercises are typical for Vympel, an unit of the FSB whose mission is to verify the efficacy of counterterrorism measures at sites such as nuclear plants. In authors' opinion, the book Blowing Up Russia by Felshtinsky and Litvinenko contained no new evidence against the FSB, and claims by Trepashkin were highly dubious. Soldatov and Borogan noted that the main point of allegations against the FSB was that Achemez Gochiyaev was an innocent businessman, who was made a scapegoat by the FSB and falsely accused of perpetrating the bombings. While in fact, Gochiyaev was well known in the Russian republic of Karachaevo-Cherkessia as a leader of a local islamist group since mid-1990s. Gochiyaev, Dekkushev and Krymshamkhalov were members of the \"Muslim Society No. 3\", founded in 1995, which counted more than 500 members by 2001, and was responsible for a series of terrorist attacks in early 2000s. Soldatov and Borogan have also noted a partial admission of guilt by Dekkushev and Krymshamkhalov during a trial in 2003.\n\nIn an interview published on May 18, 2020, Ukrainian journalist Dmitry Gordon asked former FSB officer Igor Strelkov, whether the latter took part in the FSB special operation to blow up the apartment buildings in Russia. Strelkov replied that he doubted that was a special operation at all. He clarified that during the initial stage of the Second Chechen war, he was a part of a group which attempted to capture Achemez Gochiyaev. The effort was for real, and no one in the group had doubts that it was Gochiyaev and his people who blew up the apartment buildings, at least in Volgodonsk. When pressed further with the original question, Strelkov said that, definitely, he did not blow up the blocks of apartments.\n\nAmerican journalist Paul Klebnikov believed that the most likely explanation for the bombings was that they were in fact perpetrated by Chechen militants or Islamic extremists. To support his view, Klebnikov cited past terrorist attacks by Basayev and other Chechen militants, Khattab's links to Osama bin Laden and the brutality demonstrated by Chechen field commanders in their handling of Russian prisoners of war and civilian hostages. On the contrary, Klebnikov found it hard to believe that the bombings were organized by Putin, citing his \"unusual dedication to a fixed code of conduct (albeit an authoritarian one)\".\n\nAccording to Robert Bruce Ware, the simplest explanation for the apartment block blasts is that they were perpetrated by Islamist extremists from North Caucasus who sought retribution for the attacks of the Federal forces against the Islamist enclave in the central Dagestan, known as the Islamic Djamaat. Ware points out that that would explain the timing of the attacks, and why there were no attacks after the date on which the insurgents were driven from Dagestan. It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that David Satter and Rajan Menon use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to false flag conspiracy theories such as 9\/11 conspiracy theories and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent Armed Islamic Group, emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria has achieved a de facto independence from Russia after the Khasavyurt Accord, with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.\n\nPolitical scientist Ronald R. Pope in his review of David Satter's book Darkness at Dawn cited Kirill Pankratov's criticism, published as a contribution to Johnson's Russia List. Regarding the apartment bombings, Pankratov argued that the Russian authorities did not need an additional justification to wage a war against Chechnya, in view of high-profile kidnappings and the invasion of Dagestan. One of his other arguments was that the theory of FSB responsibility for the bombings implied that it had been able to keep the lid on the operation much more effectively than the FSB had been able to execute it.\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.\n\nPolitical scientist Andrei Tsygankov criticizes the promotion of the 1999 conspiracy theory, which claims that the Kremlin was responsible for the apartment bombings, in the West. Tsygankov argues that that gives an air of legitimacy to main assertions of the theory, despite weak evidence.\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer noted that \"The FSB accused Khattab and Gochiyaev, but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov's regime, which is what the war was launched against.\"\n\n== Position of the US government ==\nIn the wake of the apartment bombings president Clinton, secretary of defense Cohen and secretary of state Albright have condemned the bombings as acts of terrorism.\n\nIn an interview with Novaya Gazeta published on 27 September 1999, director of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare Yossef Bodansky claimed that the goal of extremists, who blew up the apartment buildings, was to make the war in the Caucasus untenable for Russians and cause the latter to demand the cessation of hostilities.\n\nDuring a 4 November 1999 Senate hearing, the position of the U.S. administration in relation to the conflict in Chechnya has been voiced by ambassador-at-large Stephen Sestanovich. According to Sestanovich, Russia had \"an obligation to protect itself and its citizens from terrorists and other attacks\", however, the said obligation did not justify violations of human rights such as indiscriminate attacks against civilians and closing borders to prevent civilians from fleeing.\n\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state Madeleine Albright was questioned by senator Jesse Helms during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Albright was asked whether Russian Government was justified when it accused Chechen groups of perpetrating the bombings and whether she could forward to the Committee any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen entities. She responded that the U.S. Government had condemned the bombings in the harshest terms and offered Russia its help with the ongoing investigation, while \"we have not seen evidence that ties the bombings to Chechnya.\"\n\nOn 11 January 2017, senator Marco Rubio raised the issue of the 1999 bombings during the confirmation hearings for Rex Tillerson. According to senator Rubio, \"there's [an] incredible  body of reporting, open source and other, that this was all\u2014all those bombings were part of a black flag operation on the part of the FSB.\"\n\nOn 10 January 2018, senator Ben Cardin of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee released a report entitled \"Putin's Asymmetric Assault on Democracy in Russia and Europe: Implications for U.S. National Security\". According to the report, \"no credible evidence has been presented by the Russian authorities linking Chechen terrorists, or anyone else, to the Moscow bombings.\"\n\n===GTD entries===\n\nAccording to the Global Terrorism Database, Chechen rebels led by Khattab were suspected of perpetrating the bombings in Buynaksk, Moscow and Volgodonsk, while no responsibility had been claimed.\n\n===FOIA requests===\n\nOn 14 July 2016, David Satter filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with the State Department, the CIA and the FBI, inquiring about documents pertaining to the apartment bombings, the Ryazan incident and persons who tried to investigate the bombings and were killed. The agencies acknowledged receipt of the requests, but Satter received no other response within the statutory time limit. On 29 August 2016, Satter filed suit against the Department of Justice and other agencies involved.\n\nCIA refused even to acknowledge the existence of any relevant records because doing so would reveal \"very specific aspects of the Agency's intelligence interest, or lack thereof, in the Russian bombings.\"\n\nThe State Department responded with a redacted copy of a cable from the U.S. embassy in Moscow. According to the cable, on 24 March 2000, a former member of Russian intelligence services told a U.S. diplomat that the real story about the Ryazan incident could never be known because it \"would destroy the country.\" The informant said the FSB had \"a specially trained team of men\" whose mission was \"to carry out this type of urban warfare\". The informant has also said that Viktor Cherkesov, the FSB's first deputy director and an interrogator of Soviet dissidents was \"exactly the right person to order and carry out such actions.\"\n\nDavid Satter made a renewed FOIA request, and on 22 March 2017, State Department responded that documents concerning the U.S. assessment of the bombings would remain secret. A draft Vaughn index, a document used by agencies to justify withholdings in FOIA cases, said that the release of that information had \"the potential to inject friction into or cause serious damage\" to relationships with the Russian Government that were \"vital to U.S. national security\".\n\nOn 16 March 2018, the case Satter v. Department of Justice was closed.\n\n== Books and films ==\nThe theory of Russian government involvement appears in books and movies on the subject.\n\n=== Documentaries ===\nDavid Satter, a senior fellow of the Hudson Institute, authored two books Darkness at Dawn: The Rise of the Russian Criminal State and The Less You Know, The Better You Sleep: Russia's Road to Terror and Dictatorship under Yeltsin and Putin (published by Yale University Press in 2003 and 2016) where he scrutinized the events and came to the conclusion that the bombings were organized by Russian state security services.\n\nIn 2002, former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko and historian Yuri Felshtinsky published a book Blowing up Russia: Terror from within. According to authors the bombings and other terrorist acts have been committed by Russian security services to justify the Second Chechen War and to bring Vladimir Putin to power.\n\nIn another book, Lubyanka Criminal Group, Litvinenko and Alexander Goldfarb described the transformation of the FSB into a criminal and terrorist organization, including conducting the bombings.  Former GRU analyst and historian Viktor Suvorov said that the book describes \"a leading criminal group that provides \"protection\" for all other organized crime in the country and which continues the criminal war against their own people\", like their predecessors NKVD and KGB. He added: \"The book proves: Lubyanka [the KGB headquarters] was taken over by enemies of the people... If Putin's team can not disprove the facts provided by Litvinenko, Putin must shoot himself. Patrushev and all other leadership of Lubyanka Criminal Group must follow his example.\"\n\nAlexander Goldfarb and Marina Litvinenko published a book Death of a Dissident. They asserted that the murder of Mr. Litvinenko was \"the most compelling proof\" of the FSB involvement theory.  According to the book, the murder of Litvinenko \"gave credence to all his previous theories, delivering justice for the tenants of the bombed apartment blocks, the Moscow theater-goers, Sergei Yushenkov, Yuri Shchekochikhin, and Anna Politkovskaya, and the half-exterminated nation of Chechnya, exposing their killers for the whole world to see.\"\n\nA documentary film Assassination of Russia was made in 2000 by two French producers who had previously worked on NTV's Sugar of Ryazan program. Sergei Markov, director of the Political Research Institute in Moscow, criticised the film as \"a well-made professional example of the propagandist and psychological war\", dismissing its accusations as a conspiracy theory and comparing them to 9\/11 conspiracy theories.\n\nA documentary Nedoverie (\"Disbelief\") about the bombing controversy made by Russian director Andrei Nekrasov was premiered at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival. The film chronicles the story of Tatyana and Alyona Morozova, the two Russian-American sisters, who had lost their mother in the attack, and decided to find out who did it. His next film on the subject was Rebellion: the Litvinenko Case. The film doesn't intend to investigate the Litvinenko murder, rather than that, its goal is to put the case into a wider context of the events unfolding in post-Soviet Russia.\n\n=== Fiction ===\nWriter Alexander Prokhanov authored a prize-winning and best-selling political thriller Mr. Hexogen, published in 2002, which described the bombings as a \"chekist electoral technique\". Librarian of Congress James H. Billington referred to Prokhanov's novel as a continuation of a downward spiral in the Russian literature of the time. The plot of Mr. Hexogen has been likened to a nested doll of conspiracies within conspiracies. According to the plot, the apartment bombings have been staged by KGB agents, probably at the behest of the Jewish oligarchs, whose ultimate goal was to take power and move Russians to the Arctic while selling the organs of the healthy to Israel. Billington described the book as a \"merciless, anti-Semitic, surrealistic gloss on Moscow politics in the 1990s\".\n\nYuli Dubov, author of The Big Slice, wrote a novel The Lesser Evil, based on the bombings. The main characters of the story are Platon (Boris Berezovsky) and Larry (Badri Patarkatsishvili). They struggle against an evil KGB officer, Old man (apparently inspired by the legendary Philipp Bobkov), who brings another KGB officer, Fedor Fedorovich (Vladimir Putin) to power by staging a series of apartment bombings.\n\n==Impact on survivors==\n\nMultiple survivors of the bombings have developed disabilities, many of them were diagnosed with a posttraumatic stress disorder. In 2006 Irina Khalai, a survivor of the Volgodonsk bombing, has founded an NGO \"Volga-Don\", which promotes legislation for the legal recognition of victims of terrorist attacks.\n\n== Chronology of events ==\n\n* 5 August 1999: Shamil Basayev entered western Dagestan from Chechnya starting Dagestan war\n* 9 August 1999: Stepashin was dismissed and Putin became prime minister\n* 22 August 1999: The forces of Shamil Basayev withdrew back into Chechnya\n* 25 August 1999: Russian jets made bombing runs against 16 sites in Chechnya\n* 4 September 1999: Bombing in Buynaksk, 64 people killed, 133 are injured.\n* 9 September 1999: Bombing in Moscow, Pechatniki, 94 people are killed, 249 are injured.\n* 13 September 1999: Bombing in Moscow, Kashirskoye highway, 118 are killed.\n* 13 September 1999: A bomb was defused and a warehouse containing several tons of explosives and six timing devices have been found in Moscow.\n* 13 September 1999: Russian Duma speaker Gennadiy Seleznyov made an announcement about bombing of an apartment building in the city of Volgodonsk that took place only three days later, on 16 September.\n* 16 September 1999: Bombing in Volgodonsk, 18 are killed, 288 injured.\n* 23 September 1999: An apartment bomb was found in the city of Ryazan.

{"title":"Omagh bombing","article":"The Omagh bombing was a car bombing  on 15 August 1998 in the town of Omagh, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. It was carried out by a group calling themselves the Real Irish Republican Army, a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) splinter group who opposed the IRA's ceasefire and the Good Friday Agreement. The bombing killed 29 people (including a woman pregnant with twins) and injured some 220 others, making it the deadliest single incident of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Telephoned warnings had been sent almost 40 minutes beforehand but were inaccurate, and police had inadvertently moved people toward the bomb.\n\nThe bombing caused outrage both locally and internationally, spurred on the Northern Ireland peace process and dealt a severe blow to the dissident Irish republican campaign. The Real IRA denied that the bomb was intended to kill civilians and apologised; shortly after, the group declared a ceasefire. The victims included people of many backgrounds and ages: Protestants, Catholics, six teenagers, six children, a woman pregnant with twins, two Spanish tourists and others on a day trip from the Republic of Ireland. Both unionists and Irish nationalists were killed and injured. As a result of the bombing, new anti-terrorism laws were swiftly enacted by both the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. \n\nIt has been alleged that the British, Irish and US intelligence agencies had information which could have prevented the bombing, most of which came from double agents inside the Real IRA, but this information was not given to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). In 2008, the BBC reported that British intelligence agency GCHQ was monitoring conversations between the bombers as the bomb was being driven into Omagh.\n\nA 2001 report by the Police Ombudsman said that the RUC Special Branch failed to act on prior warnings and criticised the RUC's investigation of the bombing. Police reportedly obtained circumstantial and coincidental evidence against some suspects, but they were unable to convict anyone of the bombing. Colm Murphy was tried, and convicted. He was released on appeal after it was revealed that the Garda\u00ed forged interview notes used in the case. Murphy's nephew Sean Hoey was also tried but was acquitted. In June 2009, the victims' families won a \u00a31.6 million civil action settlement against four defendants, who were found liable for the bombing. In 2014, Seamus Daly was charged with the murder of 29 people; however, the case against him was withdrawn in 2016.\n\n== Background ==\n\nNegotiations to end the Troubles had failed in 1996 and there was a resumption of political violence, which peaked during the Drumcree crises. The peace process resumed in 1997. Sinn F\u00e9in accepted the Mitchell Principles in September 1997, which involved commitment to non-violence, as part of the peace process negotiations. Dissident members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (Provisional IRA), who considered this as a betrayal of the republican struggle for a united Ireland, left in October 1997 to form the Real Irish Republican Army (Real IRA).\n\nThe Real IRA's tactics were the same as those of the IRA before it. It targeted the British security forces and also carried out bombings of symbolic or economic targets. The goal was to damage the economy and cause severe disruption, to put pressure on the British government to withdraw. Warnings were sent before such bombings, along with a code word so that the authorities would know it was genuine. The Real IRA began its paramilitary campaign with an attempted car bombing in Banbridge, County Down on 7 January 1998. The  explosive was defused by security forces. Over the following months, it mounted several car bomb and mortar attacks. There were attacks or attempted attacks in Moira, Portadown, Armagh, Newry, Lisburn, Belfast, and Belleek, as well as another car bombing in Banbridge on 1 August, which caused thirty-five injuries but no deaths.\n\nThe Omagh bombing took place 13 weeks after the Good Friday Agreement of April 1998 was signed. Intended to be a comprehensive solution to the Troubles, it had broad support both in Ireland and internationally.\n\n== Attack ==\n\n=== Preparation and warnings ===\n\nOn 13 August, a maroon Vauxhall Cavalier was stolen from outside a block of flats in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, Republic of Ireland. At that time it bore the County Donegal registration number of 91 DL 2554. The bombers replaced its Republic of Ireland number plates with fake  Northern Ireland plates (MDZ 5211), and loaded the car with about  of fertiliser-based explosives.\n\nOn Saturday 15 August, the bomb car was driven from County Monaghan across the Irish border to Omagh, travelling north and west. A 'scout car' drove ahead of the bomb car to warn it of any checkpoints, and the two cars were in constant contact by mobile phone. At 14:19, the bomb car was parked outside S.D. Kells' clothes shop on Omagh's Market Street, at the eastern edge of the town centre, near the crossroads with Dublin Road. The driver could not find a parking space near the intended target, Omagh Courthouse. The two male bombers armed the bomb and set the timer to detonate it in 40 minutes. They left the car and walked east down Market Street towards Campsie Road, before leaving Omagh in the scout car. A family of Spanish tourists happened to take photos by the car. The photographer died in the bombing, but the man and child in the photograph survived.\n\nAt around 14:30, three phone calls were made warning of a bomb in Omagh, using the same codeword that had been used in the Real IRA's bombing in Banbridge two weeks earlier: \"Martha Pope\". The calls were made from telephone boxes many miles away in southern County Armagh. The first warning was telephoned to Ulster Television saying, \"There's a bomb, courthouse, Omagh, main street, 500lb, explosion 30 minutes\". One minute later, the office received a second warning saying, \"Bomb, Omagh town, 15 minutes\". The caller claimed the warning on behalf of \"\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann\". The next minute, the Coleraine office of the Samaritans received a call stating that a bomb would go off on the \"main street\" of Omagh \"about 200 yards\" (180 m) from the courthouse. The recipients passed on the information to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).\n\nThe BBC News stated that police \"were clearing an area near the local courthouse, 40 minutes after receiving a telephone warning, when the bomb detonated. But the warning was unclear and the wrong area was evacuated\". The warnings mentioned \"main street\" when there was no street by that name in Omagh, although Market Street\u2013High Street was the town's main shopping street. It runs for hundreds of yards east\u2013west from the site of the bomb to the courthouse. Given the warnings, police believed the bomb was near the courthouse, so they evacuated the surrounding buildings and streets. As it happened, they moved people away from the courthouse and towards the site of the bomb, placing a cordon at Scarffe's Entry. The courthouse is roughly  from the spot where the car bomb was parked. During the later Special Criminal Court trial of Real IRA director Michael McKevitt, witnesses for the prosecution said that the inaccurate warnings were accidental.\n\n=== Explosion and aftermath ===\n\nThe car bomb exploded at about 15:10 BST in the crowded shopping area. It tore the car into deadly shrapnel and created a fireball and shockwave. People were caught in \"a storm\" of glass, masonry and metal, as the blast destroyed shop fronts and blew the roofs off buildings. A thick cloud of dust and smoke filled the street. The blast was so strong that it tore up concrete and pipes burst. The water running down the street, turned red from the blood of wounded people. Within 25 minutes journalists were on the street taking pictures. Twenty-one people who had been standing near the bomb were killed outright. Eight more died on the way to or in hospital.\n\nInjured survivor Marion Radford described hearing an \"unearthly bang\", followed by \"an eeriness, a darkness that had just come over the place\", then screams as she saw \"bits of bodies, limbs\" on the ground while she searched for her 16-year-old son, Alan. She later discovered he had been killed yards away from her, after the two became separated minutes before the blast.\n\n\n\nThe BBC News said that survivors described scenes of \"utter carnage,\" with the dead and dying \"strewn across the street and other victims screaming for help\". The injured were initially taken to two local hospitals, the Tyrone County Hospital and the Erne Hospital. A local leisure centre was set up as a casualty field centre, and the British Army's Lisanelly Barracks served as a makeshift morgue. According to the Conflict Archive on the Internet, rescue workers likened the scene to \"battlefield conditions\". Tyrone County Hospital became overwhelmed, and appealed for local doctors to come in to help.\n\nBecause of the stretched emergency services, buses, cars and helicopters were used to take the victims to other hospitals in Northern Ireland, including the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry. A Tyrone County Hospital spokesman stated that they treated 108 casualties, 44 of whom had to be transferred to other hospitals. Paul McCormick of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said, \"The injuries are horrific, from amputees, to severe head injuries to serious burns, and among them are women and children.\" The morning after the bombing, a man was killed when his car collided with an ambulance ferrying bomb victims to hospitals in Belfast.\n\nOmagh Leisure Centre was used as a base for relatives and friends of the victims. There they could receive news updates.\n\n====Victims====\nA total of 18 Catholics, (including two Spaniards), and 11 Protestants were among the victims.\n\n* Catholics\n** James Barker (12), Se\u00e1n McLaughlin (12) and Oran Doherty (8), from County Donegal\n** Fernando Blasco Baselga (12) and Roc\u00edo Abad Ramos (23) from Spain\n** Geraldine Breslin (43)\n** Gareth Conway (18)\n** Breda Devine (1)\n** Aidan Gallagher (21)\n** Mary Grimes (65)\n** Brenda Logue (17)\n** Brian McCrory (54)\n** Se\u00e1n McGrath (61)\n** Jolene Marlow (17)\n** Avril Monaghan (30; Monaghan was pregnant with twins)\n** Maura Monaghan (1)\n** Elizabeth Rush (57)\n** Philomena Skelton (39)\n\n* Protestants\n** Deborah-Anne Cartwright (20)\n** Esther Gibson (36)\n** Olive Hawkes (60)\n** Julia Hughes (21)\n** Ann McCombe (48)\n** Samantha McFarland (17)\n** Alan Radford (16)\n** Veda Short (56)\n** Fred White (60)\n** Bryan White (26)\n** Lorraine Wilson (15)\n\nSe\u00e1n McGrath was the last victim to die. He was in a critical condition in hospital for three weeks before dying from his injuries on 5 September 1998.\n\n=== Reactions ===\nThere was a strong international and regional outcry against 'dissident' republicans and in favour of the Northern Ireland peace process. Prime Minister Tony Blair called the bombing an \"appalling act of savagery and evil.\" Queen Elizabeth II expressed her sympathies to the victims' families, while the Prince of Wales paid a visit to the town and spoke with the families of some of the victims. Pope John Paul II and President Bill Clinton also expressed their sympathies. The Spanish Ambassador to Ireland visited some of the injured. \n\nChurches across Northern Ireland called for a national day of mourning. Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh Robin Eames said on BBC Radio that, \"From the Church's point of view, all I am concerned about are not political arguments, not political niceties. I am concerned about the torment of ordinary people who don't deserve this.\" \n\nSocial Democratic and Labour Party leader John Hume called the perpetrators of the bombing \"undiluted fascists\".\n\nSinn F\u00e9in's Martin McGuinness said, \"This appalling act was carried out by those opposed to the peace process,\" while Gerry Adams said, \"I am totally horrified by this action. I condemn it without any equivocation whatsoever.\" McGuinness mentioned that both Catholics and Protestants alike were injured and killed, saying, \"All of them were suffering together. I think all them were asking the question 'Why?', because so many of them had great expectations, great hopes for the future.\" Sinn F\u00e9in as an organisation initially refused to co-operate with the investigation into the attack, because the Royal Ulster Constabulary was involved. On 17 May 2007, McGuinness stated that Irish republicans would co-operate with an independent, international investigation if one were created.\n\nThe security forces believed the Real IRA were responsible. RUC Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan accused the bombers of deliberately trying to direct civilians towards the bomb. \n\nAs the trial of a suspect started in 2006, British government prosecutor Gordon Kerr QC called the warnings \"not only wrong but... meaningless\" and said that the nature of the warnings made it inevitable that people would be moved towards the bomb. \n\nThree days after the bombing, the Real IRA claimed responsibility for planting the bomb but strongly denied intending to kill civilians and apologised to the victims. It also announced that \"all military operations have been suspended\". The group came under intense pressure to end its campaign. Provisional IRA members visited the homes of 60 people connected with the Real IRA, and ordered them to disband and stop interfering with its arms dumps. On 7 September, the Real IRA called a ceasefire, although it would later resume its campaign.  The Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) also called a ceasefire on 22 August. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism has accused the INLA of providing supplies for the bombing. The INLA continued to observe the ceasefire and later began to disarm. The BBC News reported that, \"Like the other bombings in the early part of 1998 in places like Lisburn and Banbridge, Omagh was a conscious attempt by republicans who disagreed with the political strategy of Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, to destabilise Northern Ireland in that vulnerable moment of hope. It failed\u00a0\u2013 but there is a terrible irony to the way in which the campaign was halted only by the wave of revulsion triggered by the carnage at Omagh.\"\n\nIn response to the bombing, both the British and Irish governments vowed to enact tougher anti-terrorism laws. On 3 September, the British parliament passed the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998, and the Irish parliament passed the Offences Against The State (Amendment) Bill. Members of both governments described the measures as \"draconian\" and the bills were rushed through, despite protests from members of parliament and civil liberties groups. The new measures included allowing suspected members of terrorist groups to be convicted on the word of a senior police officer, curtailment of the right to silence, and longer detention periods.\n\n== Responsibility ==\n\n=== Allegations ===\nThe Real IRA claimed responsibility for the bombing at the time. However, on 7 February 2008, a RIRA spokesman stated that the group \"had minimal involvement in Omagh. Our code word was used; nothing more. To have stated this at the time would have been lost in an understandable wave of emotion\" and \"Omagh was an absolute tragedy. Any loss of civilian life is regrettable.\"\n\nOn 9 October 2000, the BBC's Panorama programme aired the special Who Bombed Omagh?, hosted by journalist John Ware. The programme quoted RUC Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan as saying, \"sadly up to this point we haven't been able to charge anyone with this terrible atrocity\". The programme alleged that the police on both sides of the Irish border knew the identity of the bombers. It said, \"As the bomb car and the scout car headed for the border, the police believe they communicated by mobile phone. This is based on an analysis of calls made in the hours before, during and after the bombing. This analysis may prove to be the key to the Omagh bomb investigation.\" Using the phone records, the programme reported the names of the four prime suspects as Oliver Traynor, Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy, and Seamus Daly. The police had leaked the information to the BBC since it was too circumstantial and coincidental to be used in court.\n\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson praised the Panorama programme, calling it \"a very powerful and very professional piece of work\". Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern criticised it, saying that \"bandying around names on television\" could hinder attempts to secure convictions. First Minister David Trimble stated that he had \"very grave doubts\" about it.\n\nLawrence Rush, whose wife Elizabeth died in the bombing, tried legally to block the programme from being broadcast, saying, \"This is media justice, we can't allow this to happen\". Democratic Unionist Party assembly member Oliver Gibson, whose niece Esther died in the bombing, said that the government did not have the will to pursue those responsible and welcomed the programme.\n\nThe police believe that the bombing of BBC Television Centre in London on 4 March 2001 was a revenge attack for the broadcast. On 9 April 2003, the five RIRA members behind the BBC office's bombing were convicted and sentenced to between 16 and 22 years.\n\n=== Prosecutions and court cases ===\nOn 22 September 1998, the RUC and Garda\u00ed arrested twelve men in connection with the bombing. They subsequently released all of them without charge. On 25 February 1999, they questioned and arrested at least seven suspects. Builder and publican Colm Murphy, from Ravensdale, County Louth, was charged three days later for conspiracy and was convicted on 23 January 2002 by the Republic's Special Criminal Court. He was sentenced to fourteen years. In January 2005, Murphy's conviction was quashed and a retrial ordered by the Court of Criminal Appeal, on the grounds that two Garda\u00ed had falsified interview notes, and that Murphy's previous convictions were improperly taken into account by the trial judges.\n\nOn 28 October 2000, the families of four children killed in the bombing \u2013 James Barker, 12, Samantha McFarland, 17, Lorraine Wilson, 15, and 20-month-old Breda Devine \u2013 launched a civil action against the suspects named by the Panorama programme. On 15 March 2001, the families of all twenty-nine people killed in the bombing launched a \u00a32-million civil action against RIRA suspects Seamus McKenna (died 14 July 2013), Michael McKevitt, Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy, and Seamus Daly. Former Northern Ireland secretaries Peter Mandelson, Tom King, Peter Brooke, Lord Hurd, Lord Prior, and Lord Merlyn-Rees signed up in support of the plaintiffs' legal fund. The civil action began in Northern Ireland on 7 April 2008.\n\nOn 6 September 2006, Murphy's nephew, Sean Hoey, an electrician from Jonesborough, County Armagh, went on trial accused of 29 counts of murder, and terrorism and explosives charges. Upon its completion, Hoey's trial found on 20 December 2007 that he was not guilty of all 56 charges against him.\n\nOn 24 January 2008, former Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan apologised to the victims' families for the lack of convictions in relation to the Omagh bombing. This apology was rejected by some of the victims' families. After the Hoey verdict, BBC News reporter Kevin Connolly stated that, \"The Omagh families were dignified in defeat, as they have been dignified at every stage of their fight for justice. Their campaigning will go on, but the prospect is surely receding now that anyone will ever be convicted of murdering their husbands and brothers and sisters and wives and children.\" Police Service of Northern Ireland Chief Constable Sir Hugh Orde stated that he believed there would be no further prosecutions.\n\nOn 8 June 2009, the civil case taken by victims' relatives concluded, with Michael McKevitt, Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly being found to have been responsible for the bombing. Seamus McKenna (died 14 July 2013) was cleared of involvement. The others were held liable for  of damages. It was described as a \"landmark\" damages award internationally. Murphy and Daly appealed and were granted a retrial, but this second trial also found them responsible for the bombing, with the judge describing the evidence as overwhelming.\n\nOn 10 April 2014 Daly was charged with murdering the 29 victims of the Omagh bombing and with other offences. Daly lived in Cullaville, County Monaghan, Republic of Ireland. He was arrested in Newry by police after he crossed the border into Northern Ireland. The case against Daly was withdrawn in February 2016, with the Public Prosecution Service deciding there was \"no reasonable prospect of conviction\".\n\n=== Police Ombudsman report ===\nPolice Ombudsman Nuala O'Loan published a report on 12 December 2001 that strongly criticised the RUC over its handling of the bombing investigation. Her report stated that RUC officers had ignored the previous warnings about a bomb and had failed to act on crucial intelligence. She went on to say that officers had been uncooperative and defensive during her inquiry. The report concluded that, \"The victims, their families, the people of Omagh and officers of the RUC were let down by defective leadership, poor judgement and a lack of urgency.\" It recommended the setting up of a new investigation team independent of the new Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), which had since replaced the RUC, led by a senior officer from an outside police force.\n\nInitially, the Police Association, which represents both senior officers and rank and file members of the Northern Ireland police, went to court to try to block the release of the O'Loan report. The Association stated that, \"The ombudsman's report and associated decisions constitute a misuse of her statutory powers, responsibilities and functions.\" The group later dropped its efforts. RUC Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan called the report \"grossly unfair\" and \"an erroneous conclusion reached in advance and then a desperate attempt to find anything that might happen to fit in with that.\" Other senior police officers also disputed the report's findings. Flanagan issued a 190-page counter-report in response, and has also stated that he has considered taking legal action. He argued that the multiple warnings were given by the RIRA to cause confusion and lead to a greater loss of life. Assistant Chief Constables Alan McQuillan and Sam Kincaid sent affidavits giving information that supported the report.\n\nThe families of the victims expressed varying reactions to the report. Kevin Skelton, whose wife Philomena died in the attack, said that, \"After the bomb at Omagh, we were told by Tony Blair and the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, that no stone would be left unturned\u00a0... It seems to me that a lot of stones have been left unturned,\" but then expressed doubt that the bombing could have been prevented. Lawrence Rush, whose wife Elizabeth died in the attack, said that, \"There's no reason why Omagh should have happened \u2013 the police have been in dereliction of their duty.\" Other Omagh residents said that the police did all that they could. The Belfast Telegraph called the report a \"watershed in police accountability\" and stated that it \"broke the taboo around official criticism of police in Northern Ireland\". Upon leaving office on 5 November 2007, Nuala O'Loan stated that the report was not a personal battle between herself and Sir Ronnie, and did not lead to one. She stated that the \"recommendations which we made were complied with\".\n\n=== Independent bombing investigation ===\nOn 7 February 2008, the Northern Ireland Policing Board decided to appoint a panel of independent experts to review the police's investigation of the bombing. Some of the relatives of the bombing victims criticised the decision, saying that an international public inquiry covering both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland should be established instead. The review is to determine whether enough evidence exists for further prosecutions. It is also to investigate the possible perjury of two police witnesses made during Sean Hoey's trial. Sinn F\u00e9in Policing Board member Alex Maskey stated that, \"Sinn F\u00e9in fully supports the families' right to call for a full cross-border independent inquiry while the Policing Board has its clear and legal obligation to scrutinise the police handling of the investigations ... We recognise that the board has a major responsibility in carrying out our duty in holding the PSNI to account in the interests of justice for the Omagh families\".\n\n=== Advance warning allegations ===\nIn 2001, a double agent known as Kevin Fulton claimed he told his MI5 handlers three days before the bombing that the RIRA was about to bring a \"huge bomb\" across the border. Fulton claims he also told them who he believed was making it and where it was being made. He said that MI5 did not pass his information over to the police.\n\nRUC Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan called the allegations \"preposterous\" and said the information Fulton gave his handlers was full of \"distortions and inaccuracies\". However, Flanagan admitted that some of Fulton's information was not passed to RUC Special Branch, due to \"an administrative error\". In September 2001, British security forces informer Willie Carlin said the Ombudsman had obtained evidence confirming Fulton's allegations. A spokesman for the Ombudsman neither confirmed nor denied this assertion.\n\nDavid Rupert, an American citizen, was jointly run as an agent by MI5 and the FBI. He worked as a fundraiser for the RIRA. On 11 August 1998, four days before the bombing, Rupert informed his MI5 handlers that the RIRA was planning a car bomb attack in Omagh or Derry. It is not known whether this information was passed to the RUC Special Branch.\n\nThe Garda\u00ed also had an agent close to the RIRA at the time. The agent, Paddy Dixon, stole cars for the RIRA, who used them to transport bombs. Days before the bombing, the RIRA had Dixon steal the maroon Vauxhall Cavalier it would use in the attack. Dixon immediately told his handler; Detective Sergeant John White. On 12 August, White passed this on to his superior; Detective Chief Superintendent Dermot Jennings. According to White, Jennings told him that they would let the bomb go through, mainly so that the RIRA would not become suspicious of Dixon.\n\nDixon fled the Republic of Ireland in January 2002. The following year, a transcript of a conversation between Dixon and White was released. In it, Dixon confirms that Garda\u00ed let the bomb go through and says that \"Omagh is going to blow up in their faces\". In February 2004, PSNI Chief Constable Hugh Orde called for the Republic of Ireland to hand over Dixon. In March 2006, Chief Constable Orde stated that \"security services did not withhold intelligence that was relevant or would have progressed the Omagh inquiry\". He stated that the dissident republicans investigated by MI5 were members of a different cell than the perpetrators of the Omagh bombing.\n\nA 2013 independent report concluded that the British, Irish and American intelligence agencies \"starved\" police in Omagh of intelligence that could have prevented the bombing. The report was commissioned by the victims' families and produced by Rights Watch (UK).\n\n=== GCHQ monitoring ===\nA BBC Panorama documentary, named \"Omagh: What the police were never told\", was aired in September 2008. It revealed that the British intelligence agency GCHQ was monitoring mobile phone calls between the bombers as the bomb was being driven into Omagh. Ray White, former Assistant Chief of RUC Special Branch, said GCHQ had been monitoring mobile phones at their request. He said he believed GCHQ were listening to the phone calls 'live', rather than merely recording them for later. Panorama journalist John Ware claimed that a listening device had been hidden in the car and that GCHQ had recordings of what was said. None of this information was given to the RUC in Omagh at the time. Transcripts of the phone calls were later handed over to RUC Special Branch.\n\n== Victims' support group ==\nThe families of the victims of the bomb created the Omagh Support and Self Help Group after the bombing. The organisation is led by Michael Gallagher, whose 21-year-old son, Aidan, was killed in the Omagh attack. Its web site provides over 5000 newspaper articles, video recordings, audio recordings, and other information sources relating to the events leading up to and following the bombing as well as information about other terrorist attacks.\n\nThe group's five core objectives are \"relief of poverty, sickness, disability of victims\", \"advancement of education and protection\", \"raising awareness of needs and experiences of victims, and the effects of terrorism\", \"welfare rights advice and information\", and \"improving conditions of life for victims\". The group also provides support to victims of other bombings in Ireland, as well other terrorist bombings, such as the 2004 Madrid train bombings. The group has protested outside meetings of the 32 County Sovereignty Movement, an Irish republican political activist group opposed to the Good Friday Agreement that the families believe is part of the RIRA.\n\nIn April 2000, the group argued that the attack breached Article 57 of the Geneva Convention and stated that they will pursue the alleged bombers using international law. Michael Gallagher told BBC Radio Ulster that, \"The republican movement refused to co-operate and those people hold the key to solving this mystery. Because they have difficulty in working with the RUC and Garda\u00ed, we can't get justice.\" In January 2002, Gallagher told BBC News that, \"There is such a deeply-held sense of frustration and depression\" and called the anti-terrorist legislation passed in the wake of the Omagh bombing \"ineffective\". He expressed support for the controversial Panorama programme, stating that it reminded \"people that what happened in Omagh is still capable of happening in other towns\".\n\nIn February 2002, Prime Minister Tony Blair declined a written request by the group to meet with him at Downing Street. Group members accused the Prime Minister of ignoring concerns about the police's handling of the bombing investigation. A Downing Street spokesman stated that, \"The Prime Minister of course understands the relatives' concerns, but [he] believes that a meeting with the Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office is the right place to air their concerns at this stage.\"\n\nThe death of Adrian Gallagher, along with the experiences of his father Michael and those of other families in the Omagh Support and Self Help Group formed the story of the television film Omagh, a Channel 4-RT\u00c9 co-production. Film-maker Paul Greengrass stated \"the families of the Omagh Support and Self Help Group have been in the public eye throughout the last five years, pursuing a legal campaign, shortly to come before the courts, with far reaching implications for all of us and it feels the right moment for them to be heard, to bring their story to a wider audience so we can all understand the journey they have made.\"\n\nIn promotion for the film, Channel 4 stated that the group had pursued \"a patient, determined, indomitable campaign to bring those responsible for the bomb to justice, and to hold to account politicians and police on both sides of the border who promised so much in the immediate aftermath of the atrocity but who in the families' eyes have delivered all too little.\"\n\n== Memorials ==\n\n=== Media memorials ===\nThe bombing inspired the song \"Paper Sun\" by British hard rock band Def Leppard.\n\nAnother song inspired by the bombings was \"Peace on Earth\" by rock group U2. It includes the line, \"They're reading names out over the radio. All the folks the rest of us won't get to know. Sean and Julia, Gareth, Ann, and Breda.\" The five names mentioned are five of the victims from this attack. Another line, \"She never got to say goodbye, To see the colour in his eyes, now he's in the dirt\" was about how James Barker, a victim, was remembered by his mother Donna Barker in an article in the Irish Times after the bombing in Omagh. The Edge has described the song as \"the most bitter song U2 has ever written\". The names of all 29 people killed during the bombing were recited at the conclusion of the group's anti-violence anthem \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" during the Elevation Tour; one performance is captured on the concert video U2 Go Home: Live from Slane Castle, Ireland.\n\nIrish state broadcaster RT\u00c9 and UK network Channel 4 co-produced the 2004 film Omagh dramatising the events surrounding the bombing and its aftermath. It was directed by Pete Travis and was first shown on television in both countries in May 2004.\n\n=== Omagh memorial ===\n\nIn late 1999, Omagh District Council established the Omagh Memorial Working Group to devise a permanent memorial to the bombing victims. Its members come from both public and private sectors alongside representatives from the Omagh Churches Forum and members of the victims' families. The chief executive of the Omagh Council, John McKinney, stated in March 2000 that, \"we are working towards a memorial. It is a very sensitive issue.\" In April 2007, the Council announced the launch of a public art design competition by the Omagh Memorial Working Group. The group's goal was to create a permanent memorial in time for the tenth anniversary of the bombing on 15 August 2008. It has a total budget of \u00a3240,000.\n\nSince space for a monument on Market Street itself is limited, the final memorial was to be split between the actual bombing site and the temporary Memorial Garden about 300 metres away. Artist Sean Hillen and architect Desmond Fitzgerald won the contest with a design that, in the words of the Irish Times, \"centres on that most primal yet mobile of elements: light.\" A heliostatic mirror was to be placed in the memorial park tracking the sun in order to project a constant beam of sunlight onto 31 small mirrors, each etched with the name of a victim. All the mirrors were then to bounce the light on to a heart-shaped crystal within an obelisk pillar that stands at the bomb site.\n\nIn September 2007, the Omagh Council's proposed wording on a memorial plaque \u2013 \"dissident republican car bomb\" \u2013 brought it into conflict with several of the victims' families. Michael Gallagher has stated that \"there can be no ambiguity over what happened on 15 August 1998, and no dancing around words can distract from the truth.\" The Council appointed an independent mediator in an attempt to reach an agreement with those families. Construction started on the memorial on 27 July 2008.\n\nOn 15 August 2008, a memorial service was held in Omagh. Senior government representatives from the UK, the Republic of Ireland and the Stormont Assembly were present, along with relatives of many of the victims. A number of bereaved families, however, boycotted the service and held their own service the following Sunday. They argued that the Sinn F\u00e9in-dominated Omagh council would not acknowledge that republicans were responsible for the bombing.\n\nA memorial service was held on 15 August 2018 to mark twenty years since the bombing.

{"title":"1998 United States embassy bombings","article":"The 1998 United States embassy bombings were attacks that occurred on August 7, 1998. More than 200 people were killed in nearly simultaneous truck bomb explosions in two East African cities, one at the United States Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the other at the United States Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nThe attacks, which were linked to local members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, brought Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and their terrorist organization, al-Qaeda, to the attention of the U.S. public for the first time, and resulted in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) placing bin Laden on its ten most-wanted fugitives list. The FBI also connected the attack to Azerbaijan, as 60 calls were placed via satellite phone by bin Laden to associates in the country's capital Baku. Fazul Abdullah Mohammed and Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah were credited with being the masterminds behind the bombings.\n\n==Motivation and preparation==\nThe bombings are widely believed to have been revenge for U.S. involvement in the extradition, and alleged torture, of four members of Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) who had been arrested in Albania for an alleged series of murders in Egypt in the two months prior to the attacks. Between June and July, Ahmad Isma'il 'Uthman Saleh, Ahmad Ibrahim al-Sayyid al-Naggar, Shawqi Salama Mustafa Atiya and Mohamed Hassan Tita were all renditioned from Albania to Egypt, with the co-operation of the United States; the four men were accused of participating in the assassination of Rifaat el-Mahgoub, as well as a later plot against the Khan el-Khalili market in Cairo. The following month, a communique was issued warning the United States that a \"response\" was being prepared to \"repay\" them for their interference. However, the 9\/11 Commission Report claims that preparations began shortly after bin Laden issued his February 1998 fatwa.\n\n\nAccording to journalist Lawrence Wright, the Nairobi operation was named after the Holy Kaaba in Mecca; the Dar es Salaam bombing was called Operation al-Aqsa in Jerusalem, but \"neither had an obvious connection to the American embassies in Africa. Bin Laden initially said that the sites had been targeted because of the 'invasion' of Somalia; then he described an American plan to partition Sudan, which he said was hatched in the embassy in Nairobi. He also told his followers that the genocide in Rwanda had been planned inside the two American embassies.\" Wright concludes that bin Laden's actual goal was \"to lure the United States into Afghanistan, which had long been called 'The Graveyard of Empires.'\"\n\nIn May 1998, a villa in Nairobi was purchased by one of the bombers to enable a bomb to be built in the garage. Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan purchased a beige Toyota Dyna truck in Nairobi and a 1987 Nissan Atlas refrigeration truck in Dar es Salaam. Six metal bars were used to form a \"cage\" on the back of the Atlas to accommodate the bomb.\n\nIn June 1998, KK Mohamed rented House 213 in the Illala district of Dar es Salaam, about four miles (6\u00a0km) from the U.S. embassy. A white Suzuki Samurai was used to haul bomb components hidden in rice sacks, to House 213.\n\nIn both Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Mohammed Odeh supervised construction of two very large,  destructive devices. The Nairobi bomb was made of 400 to 500 cylinders of TNT (about the size of drink cans), ammonium nitrate, aluminium powder and detonating cord. The explosives were packed into twenty specially designed wooden crates that were sealed and then placed in the bed of the trucks. Mushin Musa Matwalli Atwah ran a wire from the bomb to a set of batteries in the back of the truck cab and then to a detonator switch beneath the dashboard. The Dar es Salaam bomb was of slightly different construction: the TNT was attached to fifteen oxygen tanks and gas canisters, and was surrounded with four bags of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and some sand bags to tamp and direct the blast.\n\nThe bombings were scheduled for August 7, the eighth anniversary of the arrival of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia during the early stages of the Persian Gulf War, likely a choice by Osama bin Laden.\n\n==Attacks and casualties==\n\nOn August 7 between 10:30\u00a0a.m. and 10:40\u00a0a.m. local time (3:30\u20133:40\u00a0a.m. EDT), suicide bombers in trucks laden with explosives parked outside the embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi, and almost simultaneously detonated. 213 people were killed in the Nairobi blast, while 11 were killed in Dar es Salaam. An estimated 4,000 in Nairobi were wounded, and another 85 in Dar es Salaam. Seismological readings analyzed after the bombs indicated energy of between  of high explosive material. Although the attacks were directed at U.S. facilities, the vast majority of casualties were local citizens of the two African countries. 12 Americans were killed, including two Central Intelligence Agency employees in the Nairobi embassy, Tom Shah (aka Uttamilal Thomas Shah) and Molly Huckaby Hardy, and one U.S. Marine, Sergeant Jesse Aliganga (aka Nathan Aliganga), a Marine Security Guard at the Nairobi embassy. U.S. Army Sergeant Kenneth Ray Hobson II was one of the 12 Americans killed in the attack.\n\nWhile Azzam drove the Toyota Dyna quickly toward the Nairobi embassy along with Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-Owhali, local security guard Benson Okuku Bwaku was warned to open the gate immediately \u2013 and fired upon when he refused to comply. Al-Owhali threw a stun grenade at embassy guards before exiting the vehicle and running off. Osama bin Laden later offered the explanation that it had been Al-Owhali's intention to leap out and shoot the guards to clear a path for the truck, but that he had left his pistol in the truck and subsequently ran off. As Bwaku radioed to Marine Post One for backup, the truck detonated.\n\nThe explosion damaged the embassy building and collapsed the neighboring Ufundi Building where most victims were killed, mainly students and staff of a secretarial college housed here. The heat from the blast was channelled between the buildings towards Haile Selassie Avenue where a packed commuter bus was burned. Windows were shattered in a radius of nearly . A large number of eye injuries occurred because people in buildings nearby who had heard the first explosion of the hand grenade and the shooting went to their office windows to have a look when the main blast occurred and shattered the windows.\n\nMeanwhile, the Atlas truck that attacked the US Embassy at 36 Laibon Road, Dar es Salaam was being driven by Hamden Khalif Allah Awad, known as \"Ahmed the German\" due to his blond hair, a former camp trainer who had arrived in the country only a few days earlier. The death toll was less than in Nairobi as the U.S. embassy was located outside the city center in the upscale Oysterbay neighborhood, and a water truck prevented the suicide bombers from getting closer to the structure.\n\nFollowing the attacks, a group calling itself the \"Liberation Army for Holy Sites\" took credit for the bombings. U.S. investigators believe the term was a cover used by Egyptian Islamic Jihad, who had actually perpetrated the bombing.\n\n==Aftermath and international response==\n\n\nIn response to the bombings, President Bill Clinton ordered Operation Infinite Reach, a series of cruise missile strikes on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan on August 20, 1998, announcing the planned strike in a prime time address on U.S. television.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1189 condemning the attacks on the embassies.\n\nBoth embassies were heavily damaged and the Nairobi embassy had to be rebuilt. It is now located across the road from the United Nations Office at Nairobi for security purposes.\n\nA memorial park was constructed on the former embassy site, dedicated on the third anniversary of the attack. Public protest marred the opening ceremony after it was announced that the park, including its wall inscribed with the names of the dead, would not be free to the public. , the park continues to charge an entrance fee.\n\nWithin months following the bombings, the United States Department of State Bureau of Diplomatic Security added Kenya to its Antiterrorism Assistance Program (ATA), which was originally created in 1983. While the addition was largely a formality to reaffirm U.S. commitment to fighting terrorism in Kenya, it nonetheless sparked the beginning of an active bilateral antiterrorism campaign between the United States and Kenya. The U.S. government also rapidly and permanently increased the monetary aid to Kenya. Immediate changes included a $42 million grant targeted specifically towards Kenyan victims.\n\n\nIn 2001, lead plaintiff James Owens and others filed a civil lawsuit against Sudan, for its role in the attack, under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act with the recently-added 1996 amendments for state-sponsored terrorism.  They argued that Sudan was at fault for providing sanctuary to the bombers, prior to the attack. The lawsuit was prolonged over a decade, hampered in part by the lack of Sudan sending counsel at times, but further struggled when the legal system ruled that foreign nations had sovereign immunity from cause of action in civil lawsuits based on the current language of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act in a 2004 case. Congress amended the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act in 2008 to correct this and to allow its provisions to retroactively apply to existing lawsuits, including Owens' case. With that, hundreds more plaintiffs joined the suit, eventually with more than 700 parties listed. By 2014, the district court awarded the plaintiffs over $10 billion.  Sudan, which had not appeared during the initial lawsuit, appealed the judgment, arguing it did not understand the US civil suit system, and did not understand the consequences of not appearing, but also challenged the retroactive nature of the 2008 change to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.  The appeals court discounted Sudan's  argument regarding its lack of understand, and still upheld them liable for the bombings, but ruled that the $4.3 billion of punitive damages were not allowed to be applied retroactively. The plainiffs petitioned to the Supreme Court to appeal, and in May 2020, the Court ruled in Opati v. Republic of Sudan that the punative damages could be retroactively applied, restoring the $4.3 billion that had been awarded at the District Court.\n\n==Indictment==\n\n\n\nFollowing the investigation, an indictment was issued. It charges the following 21 people for various alleged roles in the bombings. 18 of the cases have been settled.\n\n\n\n==See also==\n\n* Terrorism in Kenya\n* 1998 World Cup terror

{"title":"1998 Coimbatore bombings","article":"-->\n}}\n\nThe 1998 Coimbatore bombings occurred on Saturday, 14 February 1998, in the city of Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India. A total of 58 people were killed and over 200 injured in the 12 bomb attacks in 11 places, all within a  radius. The explosives used were found to be gelatin sticks activated by timer devices and were concealed in cars, motorcycles, bicycles, sideboxes of two-wheelers, denim and rexin bags, and fruit carts. Several bombs that failed to detonate were defused by bomb disposal squads of the Army, National Security Guards and Tamil Nadu Commando School.\n\nThe bombings were apparently in retaliation to the earlier riots in the city in November - December the previous year, when Hindu fundamentalists groups killed 18 Muslims and looted several thousands of properties of Muslims following the murder of a traffic policeman named Selvaraj, by a member of the radical Islamist group Al Ummah. The main conspirator was found to be S A Basha, the founder of Al Ummah, an Islamic fundamentalist body. Investigators found out that the blasts were a part of larger conspiracy to target L.K.Advani, the leader of Bharatiya Janata Party on that day at 4 p.m in his election meeting.\n\nA judicial committee formed on 7 April 2000 under Justice P.R. Gokulakrishnan to probe the case confirmed that Al Ummah was responsible for the attacks. The committee tabled its final report in the Tamil Nadu Assembly on 18 May 2000, whose recommendations were accepted in principle by the state government. The trial of the case began on 7 March 2002 and as many as 1,300 witnesses were examined. S. A. Basha, the mastermind of the blasts was found guilty of hatching a criminal conspiracy to trigger a series of explosions there on 14 February 1998 and was convicted to life sentence along with 12 others. During September 2002, Imam Ali and four others, suspected to be involved in the blasts were killed in a police encounter in Bangalore.\n\nThe loss reported by the platform vendors was several crores, but the state government awarded a compensation of  to all the victims. An individual ceiling of  was fixed as the maximum for each victim and a total of  was awarded.\n\n==Background==\nThe Hindu-Muslim fundamentalist group riots in the city culminate back to the early 1980s when there was a propaganda by Hindu Munnani, a Hindu religious extremist outfit, against the attacks on them. There were minor Muslim groups that emerged during the period and they sustained based on petty crimes. The Hindu owners and landlords pumped lot of funds for their establishments against the Muslim ones. The situation was communalized even at the level of pavement side merchants. Some Islamic fundamentalistic movements like Jihad Committee, Al Ummah and Islamic United Front became active in Tamil Nadu following the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992. In November 1997, three members of the Al Ummah murdered a police constable named Selvaraj, which lead to a protest by police. Police fired on Muslim mobs armed with bombs, knives, stones and sticks. There was widespread looting by the Hindu mob on Muslim establishments simultaneously. Many people were killed during the event, which is considered the culmination point for the serial bomb blasts. Two men, allegedly part of Al Ummah were killed along with 17 other people in the riots. The agency became popular among Muslim circles when they perpetrated a bomb blast in the building of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in Chennai in August 1993. The change to violent methods split the organisation, with some of the leaders distancing themselves or getting arrested.\n\n==Blast incidents==\nOn 14 February 1998, the first of the serial bombs exploded at 3.50\u00a0pm IST in a cycle stand at the Coimbatore Junction railway station, killing six people. There were allegations that suicide bombers were ready to target L.K. Advani, the leader of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), during his election meeting at 4\u00a0pm. At 3:55\u00a0pm, the second bomb went off in Sundarapuram, SB Towers, killing three people and the third at Shanmuganandham Road, the location of the meeting, killing four. The fourth blast occurred in the basement parking of Rajarajeswari Tower, a commercial complex. At 4:05\u00a0pm, a car bomb exploded at the entrance of the Coimbatore general hospital, killing two nurses, a patient and a doctor. The blast took place exactly in the place where a Muslim youth was charred to death in an earlier riots. At 4:10\u00a0pm, the sixth bomb went off at the Timber Mart and three bombs at the city's Variety Hall. The next blast at Poompugar killed two people. The penulatimate blast took place at 8:30\u00a0pm, at Karunanidhi Nagar, and the final one at 10\u00a0pm in Bazaar Street. Overall, in a span of six hours, the city witnessed 12 explosions that killed 58 people and injured more than 200 people.\n\nInvestigators found out that the blasts were a part of larger conspiracy to target L.K. Advani at his 4\u00a0pm election meeting. One of the bombs went off  away from the podium where he was to conduct his election rally. Since the blasts were masterminded by Islamic fundamentalists and planted in areas with a Hindu majority population, most of the victims were Hindus. There were also some Muslim victims, who were killed in the blasts. The blast near the RS Puram police station was the most powerful amongst the bombings and caused 12 casualties. The blasts were targeted at disrupting the commercial activities of the town and planted at commercial points. Most the victims belonged to other part of the city. Most of the victims were youth, who were participants in Advani's rally were killed in the blasts. Hindu fundamentalists attacked people at random and properties belonging to Muslims were ransacked, in the aftermath of the serial blasts.\n\nThe explosives used were found to be gelatin sticks activated by timer devices. They were concealed in cars, motorcycles, bicycles, sideboxes of two-wheelers, denim and rexin bags, and in a cart loaded with pineapples. Several bombs that failed to detonate were defused by bomb disposal squads of the Army, National Security Guards and Tamil Nadu Commando School. An abandoned car laden with 70\u00a0kg of explosives, was found on East Lokamanya Street in R.S. Puram, close to the BJP meeting venue, gave cause for much anxiety for days until the complicated device was dismantled.\n\n==Aftermath==\nTamil Nadu and South India are considered relatively free of communal riots and violence. The riots and the blasts following it were considered the first of its kind. The incident put Tamil Nadu in the terrorist map. The ruling party at that time, the D.M.K came under severe criticism for this incident. Most political leaders and parties expressed shock and revulsion over the blasts. AIADMK general secretary Jayalalitha demanded that then CM Karunanidhi own \"moral responsibility\" for the blasts and resign. Following a report from the Union Home Ministry on the security situation in Coimbatore, polling in the Coimbatore Lok Sabha constituency was postponed from 22 to 28 February. The bomb blast also had strong political implications. The Bharatiya Janata Party candidate C.P. Radhakrishnan won by a record margin of over 1,00,000 votes in the 1998 Lok Sabha elections.\n\nFor days after the explosions, the city of Coimbatore looked like a town deserted; business establishments, shops and roadside stalls remained closed and few people ventured out. Hotels refused admission to guests. Wild rumours of fresh bomb attacks spread. In middle-class localities, residents formed vigilante groups. Anyone new to a neighbourhood was watched closely. At R.S Puram, where several bombs had gone off, roads in some neighbourhoods were barricaded and \"outsiders\" were denied parking space for their cars. All this had more than a little to do with the car bomb discovered on East Lokamanya Road in R.S. Puram. For four days, attention was riveted on it. Residents in the locality moved out even as bomb disposal experts prepared to defuse the explosive. This incident came as a severe blow to the upcoming economy of Coimbatore. Real estate prices dropped temporarily, new investments to the city were temporarily halted. However, normalcy was restored within a few months. Dr. K. Radhakrishnan IPS, then appointed as city police commissioner Coimbatore, restored normalcy to the city. The loss reported by the platform vendors was several crores, but the state government awarded a compensation of  to all the victims. An individual ceiling of  was fixed as the maximum for each victim and a total of  was awarded.\n\n==Probe and arrests==\nWithin hours of the blasts, the Tamil Nadu Government banned the Muslim fundamentalist group Al Ummah and the Jihad Committee. Al Ummah founder-president S.A. Basha and 12 other members of the organisation were arrested in Chennai; explosive materials and weapons were seized from his house in Triplicane, Chennai. Leaders of the Jihad Committee and the Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam (TMMK) were arrested in a State-wide crackdown. Among those arrested were Jihad Committee president R.M. Haniffa, general secretary Mohammed Haniffa, student wing secretary Akram Khan, TMMK president and college lecturer M.H. Jawahirulla and treasurer G.M. Pakkar. Over the next few days, over 100 activists of the three organisations were arrested at Keezhakkarai, Devakottai, Dindigul, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Nagercoil, Melapalayam and Udumalpet. About 1,000 others were detained as a precautionary measure. In Coimbatore district, nine persons were arrested; 528 others \u2013 326 Hindus and 202 Muslims \u2013 were detained as a precautionary measure.\n\nIn Coimbatore, joint combing operations undertaken for days after the blasts by the police, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), the Rapid Action Force (RAF) and the Swift Action Force (SAF) in Kottaimedu, Tirumal Street, N.H. Road, Vincent Road, Ukkadam, Al-Ameen Colony, Majeed Colony, Salamath Nagar and Saramedu yielded a huge haul of explosives and deadly weapons: 210 gelatin sticks, 540 pipe bombs, 575 petrol bombs, 1,100 electrical detonators and a large number of knives, swords, pickaxes and sickles. Abdul Nasir Madani, chief of Islamist political outfit called PDP, well known for his provoking speeches, was arrested by the police on 31 March 1998, for his alleged link with suspects of this blast.\n\n==Justice P.R. Gokulakrishnan Commission of Inquiry==\nThe Tamil Nadu government set up a one-man commission under Justice P.R. Gokulakrishnan to probe the blasts. The commission filed a report that was tabled in the Tamil Nadu Assembly on 27 November 1998. The report indicated that the seven instances of police firing in Coimbatore on 30 November and 1 December 1997, leading to the killing of eighteen Muslims, were justified. The report found out that the blasts were culminated by the killing of police constable Selvaraj on 29 November 1997 by three members of Al-Umma that led to a revolt by police personnel and subsequent police firings on Muslim mobs.\n\nThe final report of the commission was tabled in the Assembly on 18 May 2000. The report indicted the police by stating \"the lapse on the part of the police personnel, deputed for surveillance and checks, in discharging their duties more vigorously, vigilantly and intelligently\". It also quoted that \"for surveillance and checks, had been more vigilant before the bomb blasts, the tragic incidents... could have been averted\". The report stated that several state and central vigilance warnings were discarded by the city police. The report concluded that the Muslim fundamentalist organisation Al Ummah, based in Tamil Nadu, hatched a conspiracy to \"avenge\" the killings of 18 Muslims during earlier riots. The report quoted that three human bombs named Amanuallah, Melapalayam Amjath Ali and Rafique alias Shanmugam, were targeting L.K. Advani, but could not penetrate the security cardon. The investigations found that the group used the videotapes of the deceased during the riots to mobilise sympathy and garner financial support from Muslim countries, mainly those comprising the Gulf. The report made several recommendations like deploying checkposts in sensitive areas, proscribing organisations acting against law, setting up separate intelligence wing and methods to evaluate feedback of lower level police officers. The government accepted the commission's findings in principle and stated that specific recommendations would be examined in detail by the respective departments before passing orders.\n\n==Trial==\nThe trial of the case began on 7 March 2002 and as many as 1,300 witnesses were examined. S. A. Basha, the mastermind of the blasts was found guilty of hatching a criminal conspiracy to trigger a series of explosions there on 14 February 1998 and to create enmity between the two communities. During 2002, as many as 168 people were facing trial and it came to 14 during the period of conviction of trial court in 2007.  The arguments ended on 10 April 2007 and judgement was pronounced on 24 October 2007. Out of the 14 accused, 13 were found guilty of blasts and were convicted. Madani was the only one out of the 14 to be acquitted. Madani earlier sought bail stating health grounds. Basha, the chief conspirator was awarded life sentence and his aide, Mohammad Ansari was awarded twin life sentence that run concurrently.\n\nA revision petition was filed by a victim's father in Madras High Court against the acquittal of Madani. Another revision petition was filed in the court by the 39 convicts against their conviction and one another wanted the punishment of S A Basha to be enhanced to death sentence. The court passed orders on all the petitions on 18 December 2009. It upheld the trial court judgement of 18 Al Ummah activists and also the release of Madani. It however, acquitted 21 people convicted to life sentence by the lower court.\n\nDuring September 2002, Imam Ali and four others, suspected to be involved in the blasts were killed in a police encounter in Bangalore. Police recovered lot of arms and ammunition from the site where encounter happened.\nOn 17 November 2009, nine members of Al Ummah, convicted in the blasts were released from jail for their good conduct, 16 months short of their full sentence on the occasion of 100th birth anniversary of Arignar Anna, the founder of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and ex-chief minister.\n\nFakrudeen, one of the nine released early, was 16 at the time of the blast. He stated that the group avenged the earlier communal riots with the blasts. He said after the release that \"I deeply regret the blasts.

{"title":"Khobar Towers bombing","article":"The Khobar Towers bombing was a terrorist attack on part of a housing complex in the city of Khobar, Saudi Arabia, near the national oil company (Saudi Aramco) headquarters of Dhahran and nearby King Abdulaziz Air Base on June 25, 1996. At that time, Khobar Towers was being used as living quarters for coalition forces who were assigned to Operation Southern Watch, a no-fly zone operation in southern Iraq, as part of the Iraqi no-fly zones.\n\nA truck bomb was detonated adjacent to Building #131, an eight-story structure housing members of the United States Air Force's 4404th Wing (Provisional), primarily from a deployed rescue squadron and deployed fighter squadron. In all, 19 U.S. Air Force personnel and a Saudi local were killed and 498 of many nationalities were wounded.  The official June 25, 1996, statement by the United States named members of Hezbollah Al-Hejaz as responsible. In 2006, a U.S. court found Iran and Hezbollah guilty of orchestrating the attack.\n\n==The attack==\n\nA November 13, 1995, car bombing in Riyadh led the U.S. forces stationed at Khobar Towers to raise the threat condition to THREATCON DELTA. Days after the attack, military commanders briefed soldiers and airmen at Khobar that the U.S. had received anonymous communications from an organization claiming to have carried out the Riyadh attack. The attackers claimed their goal was to get the United States Armed Forces to leave the country, and that Khobar Towers would be attacked next if troop withdrawal did not begin immediately. It was at this time that surveillance and other suspicious activity near the perimeter fences of Khobar Towers was noted by United States Air Force Security Forces; however, the forces were forbidden by the Saudi government to act in any capacity outside the perimeter of the compound, and the surveillance continued with near impunity.\n\nThe attackers were reported to have smuggled explosives into Saudi Arabia from Lebanon. Al-Mughassil, Al-Houri, Al-Sayegh, Al-Qassab, and the unidentified Lebanese man bought a large latrine service tanker truck in early June 1996 in Saudi Arabia. Over a two-week period they converted it into a truck bomb. The group now had about  of plastic explosives, enough to produce a shaped charge that detonated with the force of at least  of TNT, according to a later assessment of the Defense Special Weapons Agency. The power of the blast was magnified several ways. The truck itself shaped the charge by directing the blast toward the building. Moreover, the relatively high clearance between the truck and the ground gave it the more lethal characteristics of an air burst.\n\nIt was originally estimated by U.S. authorities to have contained  of explosives. Later the General Downing report on the incident suggested that the explosion contained the equivalent of  of TNT. The attackers prepared for the attack by hiding large amounts of explosive materials and timing devices in paint cans and  bags underground in Qatif, a city near Khobar. The bomb was a mixture of petrol and explosive powder placed in the tank of a sewage tanker truck.\n\nInitially, the attackers attempted to enter the compound at the main checkpoint. When they were denied access by U.S. military personnel, at around 9:43\u00a0p.m. local time, they drove a Datsun scout vehicle, another car and the bomb truck, to a parking lot adjacent to building #131. A chain link security fence and a line of small trees separated the car park, used for a local mosque and park, from the housing compound. The perimeter of Building #131 was approximately  from the fence line, with a perimeter road between the fence and building which was often used by military personnel for jogging. The first car entered the car park and signaled the others by flashing headlights. The bomb truck and a getaway vehicle followed shortly after. The men parked the truck next to the fence and left in the third vehicle. The bomb exploded three to four minutes later at approximately 10:20\u00a0p.m. local time.  The blast was so powerful that it was felt  away in the Persian Gulf state of Bahrain.\n\nA U.S. Air Force security policeman, Staff Sergeant Alfredo R. Guerrero, was stationed atop Building #131 when he witnessed the men, recognized the vehicles as a threat, reported it to security, and began a floor-by-floor evacuation of the building. His actions are credited with saving dozens of lives. Many of the evacuees were in the stairwell when the bomb went off. The stairwell was constructed of heavy marble and was located on the side of the building away from the truck bomb, perhaps the safest location in the building. For his actions, Guerrero was awarded the Airman's Medal which is awarded to those service members or those of a friendly nation who, while serving in any capacity with the United States Air Force, distinguish themselves by heroic actions, usually at the voluntary risk of life, but not involving actual combat.  \n\nAnother security measure is thought to have minimized damage; along the security fence were Jersey barriers, concrete barriers commonly used along roadways. These deflected the blast energy upward, and away from the lower floors of the building, perhaps even preventing a total collapse of the structure.\n\n\nThe force of the explosion was enormous. The size of the explosion created an intense dust storm as the forces of the high pressure blast wave and the subsequent vacuum forces caused considerable damage in their own right. Several military vehicles parked to the left side of building #131 suffered no direct impact from debris, but were heavily damaged by the sheer intensity of the shock wave.\n\nThe explosion heavily damaged or destroyed six high rise apartment buildings in the complex. Windows were shattered in virtually every other building in the compound and in surrounding buildings up to a mile (1.6\u00a0km) away. A very large crater,  wide and  deep, was left where the truck had been.  Within a few hours of the blast, the crater began to fill with salt-water from the Persian Gulf.  In the minutes following the blast, the residents of the complex evacuated severely injured U.S. military personnel from the area. With power out in many of the buildings near #131, the scene was chaotic and tense as little was known about the safety of the area from further attacks. Many residents later gathered in the local dining facility, set up as a triage center, and saw breaking news of the event on large projection televisions intended to bring news of events back home to the troops.\n\n== Victims ==\nIn all, 19 U.S. Air Force personnel were killed:\n\n# Captain Christopher Adams\n# Captain Leland Haun\n# Master Sergeant Michael G. Heiser\n# Master Sergeant Kendall K. Kitson\n# Technical Sergeant Daniel B. Cafourek\n# Technical Sergeant Patrick P. Fennig\n# Technical Sergeant Thanh V. Nguyen\n# Staff Sergeant Ronald King\n# Staff Sergeant Kevin Johnson\n# Sergeant Millard D. Campbell\n# Senior Airman Earl R. Cartrette, Jr.\n# Senior Airman Jeremy A. Taylor\n# Airman 1st Class Christopher Lester\n# Airman 1st Class Brent E. Marthaler\n# Airman 1st Class Brian W. McVeigh\n# Airman 1st Class Peter W. Morgera\n# Airman 1st Class Joseph E. Rimkus\n# Airman 1st Class Justin Wood\n# Airman 1st Class Joshua E. Woody\n# One unidentified Saudi local\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Investigation===\nAfter the blast, an assessment crew consisting of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), and United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) was sent to assess the risk to other security compounds in Saudi Arabia, and to offer suggestions for the Khobar Towers complex. It was suggested that Mylar tape be used to coat the windows for a barrier, but the cost, about US$4.5 million, was considered prohibitive. It was also suggested that the perimeter be expanded to at least 500 feet to protect servicemen from flying glass.\n\n====Intelligence and security failures====\nAfter the bombing of Khobar Towers, the U.S. military and intelligence community came under heavy criticism for their lack of preparation and foresight for what was considered an intelligence failure. According to the New York Times, \"significant shortcomings in planning, intelligence, and basic security left American forces in Saudi Arabia vulnerable.\"\n\nNumerous warnings had been made available to the intelligence community and military command, and up to \"ten incidences [were] reported suggesting that the Khobar Towers are under surveillance\" from April to June, 1996. These warnings came both before and after the beheadings of four Saudi nationals after their publicly confessed role in the November 1995 attacks in Riyadh. Clinton Administration officials admit that they \"received a wave of threats against Americans and American installations in Saudi Arabia\" in the weeks leading up to the attack, \"but failed to prepare adequately for a bomb of the power that killed 19 American military personnel.\" Threats were also downplayed by the Saudis when Defense Minister Prince Sultan bin Abd al-Aziz al-Saud characterized acts carried out by Saudi Islamic jihadists in 1995 as \"boyish\", and stated that the Saudi \"Kingdom is not influenced by threats\". Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA) commented during a Senate intelligence committee meeting by saying \"there was no intelligence failure ... there had been more than 100 intelligence reports on alerts of a general nature, and very specific reports\" of an extant and present threat to the Khobar Towers complex.\n\nThe CIA was blamed for misjudging the bomb-making capabilities of Saudi militants, arbitrarily deciding that no bomb could exceed the size of that used in the November 1995 bombings in Riyadh (200 lbs). According to official U.S. government estimates, the Khobar bomb weighed in at approximately 5,000 pounds. American commanders were also blamed, as they had not taken every precaution advised by the Pentagon; specifically, because \"the project was deemed too costly\", they had failed to implement a recommendation to coat Khobar's windows with plastic to prevent flying glass.  \n\nThe main security concern at the Khobar Towers compound before the bombing had been the prevention of an attack similar to the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings, when a vehicle-bomb entered the compound itself. Yet the Pentagon's report from that incident suggested, as did the Khobar report, that a Beirut-sized bomb would still have caused significant damage from as far as 300 feet away. Officials concluded with the observation that bomb size was less important to the production of catastrophic results than that same bomb's effective proximity (blast radius).\n\n===Operational relocation===\nAs a result of the terrorist attack, U.S. and coalition military operations at Khobar and Dhahran were subsequently relocated to Prince Sultan Air Base, a remote and highly secure Royal Saudi Air Force installation near Al-Kharj in central Saudi Arabia, approximately 70 miles from Riyadh. American, British, and French military operations would continue at Prince Sultan until late-2003, when French forces withdrew and American and British operations shifted to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.\n\n==Culpability==\n\n===Initial blame===\nThe bombing of Khobar Towers, according to the Saudi government, was carried out by \"Saudi Islamic militants, including many veterans of the Afghan War.\" One U.S. official claimed that \"it now seems it was not an isolated case. There is an organization of violent opponents whose members are loosely connected, organized in semi-independent cells like other violent fundamentalist movements in the Arab World.\"\n\n===Indictment===\nThe three-year investigation had led the FBI to conclude that Iran was involved in the attack. At that time, the Clinton administration hoped to open a dialogue with reformist president Khatami, which would be impossible after accusing Iranians of supporting terrorist action. A secret letter, delivered directly to Khatami by Sultan Qaboos of Oman, stated that the United States had evidence of direct Iranian involvement in the act, and demanded that those involved be held responsible for their actions. Khatami refused to begin an investigation and Iranian officials stated that al-Qaeda was responsible for the attack.\n\nIn April 1997, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John Shalikashvili, said that the Pentagon did not have sufficient evidence about the bombers to consider retaliation against foreign countries that may have played a role.\n\nIn June 2001, an indictment was issued in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in Alexandria, Virginia charging the following people with murder, conspiracy, and other charges related to the bombing:\n* Imad Mughniyeh\n* Talal Hamiyah\n* Ahmed Ibrahim Al-Mughassil\n* Abdelkarim Hussein Mohamed Al-Nasser\n* Ali Saed Bin Ali El-Hoorie\n* Ibrahim Salih Mohammed Al-Yacoub\n* Hani al-Sayegh who had been previously in U.S. custody but deported to Saudi Arabia, when charges against him were dropped due to a lack of evidence.\n* Eight other Saudis\n* One Lebanese man listed as \"John Doe\".\n\nIn July 2001, Saudi Arabia said that eleven of the people indicted in the US were in custody in Saudi prisons, and were to be tried in Saudi court, as the country refused to extradite any of them to the United States to stand trial.  The government has not since made public the outcome of the trial or the whereabouts of the prisoners.\n\nIn August 2015, Arab newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat reported that Ahmed Ibrahim Al-Mughassil, a leader of the gulf shia group Hezbollah Al-Hejaz found to be responsible for the bombing, had been arrested in Beirut and transferred to Saudi Arabian custody; an anonymous American intelligence officer told The New York Times that the Saudi government had not confirmed the arrest, but U.S. intelligence believed the report was accurate.\n\n===Attribution to al-Qaeda===\nAbdel Bari Atwan wrote:\n\n\nIn 2004, the 9\/11 Commission noted that Osama Bin Laden was seen being congratulated on the day of the Khobar attack, and stated there were reports in the months preceding the attack that Bin Laden was seeking to facilitate a shipment of explosives to Saudi Arabia. According to the United States, classified evidence suggests that the government of Iran was the key sponsor of the incident, and several high-ranking members of their military may have been involved. A U.S. federal court speculated that the Khobar Towers bombing was authorized by Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran.\n\nWilliam Perry, who was the United States Secretary of Defense at the time that this bombing happened, said in an interview in June 2007 that \"he now believes al-Qaida rather than Iran was behind a 1996 truck bombing at an American military base.\"\n\nOn December 22, 2006, high court judge Royce C. Lamberth ruled that Iran and Hezbollah were directly and personally responsible for the attack, stating that the leading experts on Hezbollah presented \"overwhelming\" evidence of the group's involvement and that six captured Hezbollah agents detailed the role of Iranian intelligence and military officials in providing money, explosives, arms and weapons, plans, and maps. This decision was reached as a default judgment, however, in which the Iranian government was not represented in court, because they chose not to challenge the allegations in a U.S. courtroom.\n\n==See also==\n* 1983 Beirut barracks bombing\n* 2004 Khobar massacre\n* Insurgency in Saudi Arabia\n* Riyadh compound bombings (May 12, 2003).

{"title":"Attack on the Egyptian Embassy in Pakistan","article":"Carried out by the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the 19 November 1995 attack on the Egyptian embassy in Islamabad, Punjab, Pakistan was retaliation against the diplomatic staffers who were accused of gathering intelligence on Jihad factions inside Pakistan. It was the deadliest attack against the Egyptian government, since it had been declared apostate three years earlier by Islamic militants.\n\n==Attack==\nAyman al-Zawahiri planned the attack in 1994, shortly after aligning himself together with Osama bin Laden, initially hoping to target the Khan el-Khalili marketplace on the same day. Members such as Abu Hafs claimed it was in response to Pakistan's extradition of several al-Jihad members to face imprisonment, torture and sexual abuse in Egypt. Al-Zawahiri later said that the group had wanted to target the American embassy, but it was too heavily fortified.\n\nTwo men approached the embassy at approximately 9:30\u00a0am and killed its security detail with their guns and grenades. A vehicle described alternately as either a pick-up truck or a small car resembling a taxi loaded with a 250-pound bomb then rushed into the compound. The driver set off the bomb, blowing apart the gates. Three minutes later, a Jeep carrying a second, larger bomb also detonated and the side of the building crumbled. The Japanese and Indonesian embassies were also damaged, as was a nearby bank.\n\nThe two bombers, the Second Secretary for the embassy, three Egyptian security guards and 12 others including Pakistani security guards, civilians and as many as four other diplomats were killed in total, and approximately sixty were wounded. A 17th person died in the hospital the following day.\n\nIt was the group's first success under Zawahiri's leadership, but Bin Laden had disapproved of the operation. The bombing alienated the host of the embassy, Pakistan, and Pakistan was \"the best route into Afghanistan.\" Zawahiri later referred to the bombings in his autobiographical text.\nWe had to react to the Egyptian government's expansion of its campaign against Egyptian fundamentalists outside the country. So we decided to target a painful goal for all the parties of this evil alliance. After studying the situation we decided to assign a group to react to this and we assigned their targets, first bombing the American embassy in Islamabad and if that wasn't easy, then one of the American targets in Islamabad. If that didn't work, then the target should be bombing a Western embassy famous for its historic hatred for Muslims, and if not that, then the Egyptian embassy. Our extensive and detailed surveillance found that targeting the American Embassy was beyond the abilities of the assigned group, so we decided to study one of the American targets in Islamabad, and we discovered it has few American employees and most of the victims would be Pakistani. We also discovered that targeting the other Western embassies was beyond the abilities of the assigned group, so we settled on targeting the Egyptian embassy in Islamabad, which was not only running a campaign for chasing Arabs in Pakistan but also spying on the Arab Mujahedeen\u2026later, Pakistani security found in the ruins of the embassy evidence revealing the co-operation between India and Egypt in espionage.\n\nA short time before the bombing of the embassy the assigned group asked our permission. They told us they could strike both the Egyptian and American Embassies if we gave them extra money. We had already provided them with all that we had and we couldn't collect more money. So the group focused on bombing the Egyptian embassy. The rubble of the embassy left a clear message to the Egyptian government.\n::Al-Sharq Al-Awsat, 3 December 2001\n\nThree groups had all simultaneously taken responsibility for the attack, including al-Jihad, the International Justice Group and the Islamic Holy War group.\n\nFormer CIA agent Robert Baer claims that Imad Mughniyah \"facilitated the travel\" of somebody involved, and that one of his deputies had \"provided a stolen Lebanese passport to one of the planners of the bombing\".\n\n==Investigation==\nThe engine block of the truck used in the bombing was found, with its VIN intact, leading investigators to call on the last registered owner of the vehicle. He told authorities that he had sold the truck to two men, and drew a rough sketch of each of the individuals, who Pakistani authorities claimed to be able to identify; although they would not release their names. It was also noted that of five Afghans scheduled to be working in the Embassy at the time of the attack, only one was present and authorities were \"looking for\" the other four.\n\nWithin days of the bombing, Pakistan announced the arrests of six Egyptians, two Afghans and two Jordanians.\n\nThe Canadian Ahmed Khadr was arrested in January, after it was discovered that Khalid Abdullah, believed to have purchased one of the vehicles used in the bombing, had been staying with the Khadr family and was engaged to their eldest daughter Zaynab. Khadr was released in March 1996 based on a lack of evidence indicating he had any involvement.\n\nBy December, 16 people had been arrested in connection with the bombing.\n\nIn January 1996, Pakistan announced they had arrested Sudanese men Syed Ahmad and Bashir Bahar Qadim in Faisalabad in connection with the attacks.\n\nIn October 1998, Tareq Ali Mursi, Jamal Shueib and Eid Abdul Samee Abdulsamee were all captured in South Africa and were the subject of extraordinary renditions back to Egypt where they were accused of participating in the bombing.\n\nIn May 1999, Hasan Ahmed Rabi was arrested in Kuwait, and extradited to Egypt where he was accused of involvement with the Embassy bombing.\n\nIn July 1999, 71 alleged militants, including Isam Shu'ayb and Id Abd al-Mun'im connected to the embassy bombing saw their cases transferred to a military court.\n\nIn 2001, Egyptian forces surrounded Khadr's house in Peshawar, and requested that Pakistani ISI forces offer assistance in capturing the man they still believed had knowledge of the Embassy bombing in Islamabad. Instead, the ISI contacted the Taliban, who sent a diplomatic car to pick up Khadr and bring him into Afghanistan.\n\nIn 2002, Abul-Dahab confessed to Egyptian interrogators that he had funded the attack on orders from bin Laden, and had transferred money from a Californian bank account to Pakistan to finance the attack.\n\n==Consequences==\nOmar Nasiri would later recall when the Afghan training camps heard the news of the attack, and Derunta was filled with every kind of ammunition being fired in the air in celebration.\n\nPakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto stated that the attack was not meant to destabilise the country, but send a clear message of retribution for the extradition of Ramzi Yousef. Pakistan immediately expelled Maktab al-Khidamat from their borders, and clamped down on Islamist groups.\n\nWhile Western diplomats originally warned Pakistan the event was because \"they were not doing enough\" to combat terrorism, Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar rebuffed the claims pointing out that the attack had occurred because Egypt had extradited ten suspected terrorists.\n\nIn her 2004 trial in the United States, Lynne Stewart saw the prosecution introduce newspaper clippings seized from her possession which spoke of the bombing.\n\n==External links==\n* Photograph of the aftermath of the bombing published by Reuters\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org\/jsource\/biography\/Zawahiri.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1995\/11\/20\/world\/islamic-militants-war-on-egypt-going-international.html","http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/CNN\/Programs\/people\/shows\/zawahiri\/profile.html","http:\/\/weekly.ahram.org.eg\/1998\/390\/fr1.htm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20090213185342\/http:\/\/weekly.ahram.org.eg\/1998\/390\/fr1.htm","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1995\/11\/20\/world\/no-headline-051039.html","http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/magazine\/article\/0,9171,501020506-233999,00.html","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1995\/11\/24\/world\/world-news-briefs-pakistan-arrests-10-in-embassy-bombing.html?sq=embassy+bombing+islamabad&scp=1&st=nyt","http:\/\/www.wrmea.com\/backissues\/0496\/9604030.htm","http:\/\/www.arabicnews.com\/ansub\/Daily\/Day\/981120\/1998112005.html","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20080905044926\/http:\/\/www.arabicnews.com\/ansub\/Daily\/Day\/981120\/1998112005.html","http:\/\/cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca\/rss\/Jaballah.pdf","http:\/\/nl.newsbank.com\/nl-search\/we\/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=BBAB&d_place=BBAB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F99F883B1254C24&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM","https:\/\/caselaw.findlaw.com\/us-2nd-circuit\/1498462.html<\/ref>"]}
{"title":"Oklahoma City bombing","article":"The Oklahoma City bombing was a domestic terrorist truck bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States, on April 19, 1995. Perpetrated by American terrorists Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, the bombing happened at 9:02\u00a0am and killed at least 168 people, including many children, injured more than 680 others, and destroyed more than one third of the building, which had to be demolished. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings within a 16-block radius, shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings, and destroyed or burned 86 cars, causing an estimated $652\u00a0million worth of damage. Local, state, federal, and worldwide agencies engaged in extensive rescue efforts in the wake of the bombing. They and the city received substantial donations from across the country. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated 11 of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations. Until the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Oklahoma City bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack in the history of the United States. It remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history.\n\nWithin 90 minutes of the explosion, McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession. Forensic evidence quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days, both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, a veteran of the Gulf War and a sympathizer with the U.S. militia movement, had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives he parked in front of the building. Nichols had assisted with the bomb's preparation. Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and unhappy about its handling of the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the fire that ended the siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas.\n\nThe official FBI investigation, known as \"OKBOMB\", involved 28,000 interviews and collecting 3.5 short tons (3,200\u00a0kg) of evidence and nearly one billion pieces of information. The bombers were tried and convicted in 1997. Sentenced to death, McVeigh was executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001, at the U.S. federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison in 2004. Michael and Lori Fortier testified against McVeigh and Nichols; Michael Fortier was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to warn the United States government, and Lori received immunity from prosecution in exchange for her testimony.\n\nIn response to the bombing, the U.S. Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which tightened the standards for habeas corpus in the United States. It also passed legislation to increase the protection around federal buildings to deter future terrorist attacks. \n\nOn April 19, 2000, the Oklahoma City National Memorial was dedicated on the site of the Murrah Federal Building, commemorating the victims of the bombing. Remembrance services are held every year on April 19, at the time of the explosion.\n\n==Planning==\n===Motive===\n\nThe chief conspirators, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, met in 1988 at Fort Benning during basic training for the U.S. Army. McVeigh met Michael Fortier as his Army roommate. The three shared interests in survivalism. They expressed anger at the federal government's handling of the 1992 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) standoff with Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge, as well as the Waco siege, a 1993 51-day standoff between the FBI and Branch Davidian members that began with a botched Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) attempt to execute a search warrant. There was a firefight and ultimately a siege of the compound, resulting in the burning and shooting deaths of David Koresh and 75 others. In March 1993, McVeigh visited the Waco site during the standoff, and again after the siege ended. He later decided to bomb a federal building as a response to the raids.\n\n===Target selection===\n\nMcVeigh later said that he had contemplated assassinating Attorney General Janet Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others rather than attacking a building, and sometimes wished he had done so. He initially intended to destroy only a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be more powerful if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.\n\nA resident of Kingman, Arizona, McVeigh considered targets in Missouri, Arizona, Texas, and Arkansas. He said in his authorized biography that he wanted to minimize non-governmental casualties, so he ruled out a 40-story building in Little Rock, Arkansas, because a florist's shop occupied space on the ground floor. In December 1994, McVeigh and Fortier visited Oklahoma City to inspect McVeigh's target: the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. \n\nThe Murrah building had been targeted in October 1983 by white supremacist group The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord, including founder James Ellison and Richard Snell. The group had plotted to park \"a van or trailer in front of the Federal Building and blow it up with rockets detonated by a timer.\" After Snell's appeal for murdering two people in unrelated cases was denied, it happened that he was executed the same day as the Murrah bombing.\n\nThe nine-story building, built in 1977, was named for a federal judge and housed 14 federal agencies, including the DEA, ATF, Social Security Administration, and recruiting offices for the Army and Marine Corps. \n\nMcVeigh chose the Murrah building because he expected its glass front to shatter under the impact of the blast. He also believed that its adjacent large, open parking lot across the street might absorb and dissipate some of the force, and protect the occupants of nearby non-federal buildings. In addition, McVeigh believed that the open space around the building would provide better photo opportunities for propaganda purposes. He planned the attack for April 19, 1995, to coincide with the 2nd anniversary of the Waco siege and the 220th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord during the American Revolution.\n\n===Gathering materials===\nMcVeigh and Nichols purchased or stole the materials they needed to manufacture the bomb, and stored them in rented sheds. In August 1994, McVeigh obtained nine Kinestiks from gun collector Roger E. Moore, and ignited the devices with Nichols outside Nichols's home in Herington, Kansas. On September 30, 1994, Nichols bought forty  bags of ammonium nitrate fertilizer from Mid-Kansas Coop in McPherson, Kansas, enough to fertilize  of farmland at a rate of  of nitrogen per acre (.4 ha), an amount commonly used for corn. Nichols bought an additional  bag on October 18, 1994. McVeigh approached Fortier and asked him to assist with the bombing project, but he refused.\n\nMcVeigh and Nichols robbed Moore in his home of $60,000 worth of guns, gold, silver, and jewels, transporting the property in the victim's van. McVeigh wrote Moore a letter in which he claimed that the robbery had been committed by government agents. Items stolen from Moore were later found in Nichols's home and in a storage shed he had rented.\n\nIn October 1994, McVeigh showed Michael and Lori Fortier a diagram he had drawn of the bomb he wanted to build. McVeigh planned to construct a bomb containing more than  of ammonium nitrate fertilizer mixed with about  of liquid nitromethane and  of Tovex. Including the weight of the sixteen 55-U.S.-gallon drums in which the explosive mixture was to be packed, the bomb would have a combined weight of about . McVeigh originally intended to use hydrazine rocket fuel, but it proved too expensive. During the Chief Auto Parts Nationals, a round of the NHRA Winston Drag Racing Series at the Texas Motorplex, McVeigh posed as a motorcycle racer and attempted to purchase  drums of nitromethane on the pretext that he and some fellow bikers needed the fuel for racing. But there were no nitromethane-powered motorcycles at the meeting, and he did not have an NHRA competitors' license.  Representative Steve LeSueur refused to sell to him because he was suspicious of McVeigh's actions and attitudes, but sales representative Tim Chambers sold him three barrels. Chambers questioned the purchase of three barrels, when typically only 1\u20135 gallons of nitromethane, he noted, would be purchased by a Top Fuel Harley rider, and the class was not even raced that weekend.  LeSueur reported the incident to the FBI immediately after rejecting McVeigh's request.\n\nMcVeigh rented a storage space in which he stockpiled seven crates of  Tovex sausages, 80 spools of shock tube, and 500 electric blasting caps, which he and Nichols had stolen from a Martin Marietta Aggregates quarry in Marion, Kansas. He decided not to steal any of the  of ANFO (ammonium nitrate\/fuel oil) he found at the scene, as he did not believe it powerful enough (he did obtain 17 bags of ANFO from another source for use in the bomb). McVeigh made a prototype bomb that was detonated in the desert to avoid detection.\n\n\n\nLater, speaking about the military mindset with which he went about the preparations, he said, \"You learn how to handle killing in the military. I face the consequences, but you learn to accept it.\" He compared his actions to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, rather than the attack on Pearl Harbor, reasoning it was necessary to prevent more lives from being lost.\n\nOn April 14, 1995, McVeigh paid for a motel room at the Dreamland Motel in Junction City, Kansas. The next day he rented a 1993 Ford F-700 truck from Ryder under the name Robert D. Kling, an alias he adopted because he knew an Army soldier named Kling with whom he shared physical characteristics, and because it reminded him of the Klingon warriors of Star Trek. On April 16, 1995, he and Nichols drove to Oklahoma City, where he parked a getaway car, a yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis, several blocks from the Murrah Federal Building. The nearby Regency Towers Apartments' lobby security camera recorded images of Nichols's blue 1984 GMC pickup truck on April 16. After removing the car's license plate, he left a note covering the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) plate that read, \"Not abandoned. Please do not tow. Will move by April 23. (Needs battery & cable).\" Both men then returned to Kansas.\n\n===Building the bomb===\nOn April 17\u201318, 1995, McVeigh and Nichols removed the bomb supplies from their storage unit in Herington, Kansas, where Nichols lived, and loaded them into the Ryder rental truck. They then drove to Geary Lake State Park, where they nailed boards onto the floor of the truck to hold the 13\u00a0barrels in place and mixed the chemicals using plastic buckets and a bathroom scale. Each filled barrel weighed nearly . McVeigh added more explosives to the driver's side of the cargo bay, which he could ignite (killing himself in the process) at close range with his Glock 21 pistol in case the primary fuses failed. During McVeigh's trial, Lori Fortier (the wife of Michael Fortier) stated that McVeigh claimed to have arranged the barrels in order to form a shaped charge. This was achieved by tamping the aluminum side panel of the truck with bags of ammonium nitrate fertilizer to direct the blast laterally towards the building. Specifically, McVeigh arranged the barrels in the shape of a backwards J; he later said that for pure destructive power, he would have put the barrels on the side of the cargo bay closest to the Murrah Building; however, such an unevenly distributed  load might have broken an axle, flipped the truck over, or at least caused it to lean to one side, which could have drawn attention. All or most of the barrels of ANNM contained metal cylinders of acetylene intended to increase the fireball and the brisance of the explosion.\n\nMcVeigh then added a dual-fuse ignition system accessible from the truck's front cab. He drilled two\u00a0holes in the cab of the truck under the seat, while two\u00a0holes were also drilled in the body of the truck. One\u00a0green cannon fuse was run through each hole into the cab. These time-delayed fuses led from the cab through plastic fish-tank tubing conduit to two sets of non-electric blasting caps which would ignite around  of the high-grade explosives that McVeigh stole from a rock quarry. The tubing was painted yellow to blend in with the truck's livery, and duct-taped in place to the wall to make it harder to disable by yanking from the outside. The fuses were set up to initiate, through shock tubes, the  of Tovex Blastrite Gel \"sausages\", which would in turn set off the configuration of barrels. Of the 13\u00a0filled barrels, nine contained ammonium nitrate and nitromethane, and four contained a mixture of the fertilizer and about  of diesel fuel. Additional materials and tools used for manufacturing the bomb were left in the truck to be destroyed in the blast. After finishing the truck bomb, the two\u00a0men separated; Nichols returned home to Herington and McVeigh traveled with the truck to Junction City. The bomb cost about $5000 to make.\n\n==Bombing==\n\nMcVeigh's original plan had been to detonate the bomb at 11:00\u00a0am, but at dawn on April 19, 1995, he decided instead to destroy the building at 9:00\u00a0am. As he drove toward the Murrah Federal Building in the Ryder truck, McVeigh carried with him an envelope containing pages from The Turner Diaries\u00a0\u2013 a fictional account of white supremacists who ignite a revolution by blowing up the FBI headquarters at 9:15 one morning using a truck bomb. McVeigh wore a printed T-shirt with the motto of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Sic semper tyrannis (\"Thus always to tyrants\", according to legend what Brutus said as he assassinated Julius Caesar, also claimed to have been done by John Wilkes Booth immediately after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln) and \"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants\" (from Thomas Jefferson). He also carried an envelope full of revolutionary materials that included a bumper sticker with the slogan, falsely attributed to Thomas Jefferson, \"When the government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.\" Underneath, McVeigh had written, \"Maybe now, there will be liberty!\" with a hand-copied quote by John Locke asserting that a man has a right to kill someone who takes away his liberty.\n\nMcVeigh entered Oklahoma City at 8:50\u00a0am. At 8:57\u00a0am, the Regency Towers Apartments' lobby security camera that had recorded Nichols's pickup truck three days earlier recorded the Ryder truck heading towards the Murrah Federal Building. At the same moment, McVeigh lit the five-minute fuse. Three minutes later, still a block away, he lit the two-minute fuse. He parked the Ryder truck in a drop-off zone situated under the building's day-care center, exited and locked the truck. As he headed to his getaway vehicle, he dropped the keys to the truck a few blocks away.\n\n\n\nAt 9:02\u00a0a.m. (14:02 UTC), the Ryder truck, containing over  of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, nitromethane, and diesel fuel mixture, detonated in front of the north side of the nine-story Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. 168 people were killed and hundreds more injured. One third of the building was destroyed by the explosion, which created a ,  crater on NW 5th Street next to the building. The blast destroyed or damaged 324\u00a0buildings within a 4-block radius, and shattered glass in 258\u00a0nearby buildings. The broken glass alone accounted for 5\u00a0percent of the death total and 69\u00a0percent of the injuries outside the Murrah Federal Building. The blast destroyed or burned 86\u00a0cars around the site. The destruction of the buildings left several hundred people homeless and shut down a number of offices in downtown Oklahoma City. The explosion was estimated to have caused at least $652\u00a0million worth of damage.\n\nThe effects of the blast were equivalent to over  of TNT, and could be heard and felt up to  away. Seismometers at the Omniplex Science Museum in Oklahoma City,  away, and in Norman, Oklahoma,  away, recorded the blast as measuring approximately 3.0 on the Richter magnitude scale.\n\nThe collapse took roughly 7 seconds. As the truck exploded, it first destroyed the column next to it, designated as G20, and shattered the entire glass facade of the building. The shockwave of the explosion forced the lower floors upwards, before the fourth and fifth floors collapsed onto the third floor, which housed a transfer beam that ran the length of the building and was being supported by four pillars below and was supporting the pillars that hold the upper floors. The added weight meant that the third floor gave way along with the transfer beam, which in turn caused the total collapse of the building.\n\n==Arrests==\nInitially, the FBI had three hypotheses about responsibility for the bombing: international terrorists, possibly the same group that had carried out the World Trade Center bombing; a drug cartel, carrying out an act of vengeance against DEA agents in the building's DEA office; and anti-government radicals attempting to start a rebellion against the federal government.\n\n\nMcVeigh was arrested within 90\u00a0minutes of the explosion, as he was traveling north on Interstate 35 near Perry in Noble County, Oklahoma. Oklahoma State Trooper Charlie Hanger stopped McVeigh for driving his yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis without a license plate, and arrested him for having a concealed weapon. For his home address, McVeigh falsely claimed he resided at Terry Nichols's brother James's house in Michigan. After booking McVeigh into jail, Trooper Hanger searched his patrol car and found a business card which had been concealed by McVeigh after being handcuffed. Written on the back of the card, which was from a Wisconsin military surplus store, were the words \"TNT at $5 a stick. Need more.\" The card was later used as evidence during McVeigh's trial.\n\nWhile investigating the VIN from an axle of the truck used in the explosion and the remnants of the license plate, federal agents were able to link the truck to a specific Ryder rental agency in Junction City, Kansas. Using a sketch created with the assistance of Eldon Elliot, owner of the agency, the agents were able to implicate McVeigh in the bombing. McVeigh was also identified by Lea McGown of the Dreamland Motel, who remembered him parking a large yellow Ryder truck in the lot; McVeigh had signed in under his real name at the motel, using an address that matched the one on his forged license and the charge sheet at the Perry Police Station. Before signing his real name at the motel, McVeigh had used false names for his transactions. However, McGown noted, \"People are so used to signing their own name that when they go to sign a phony name, they almost always go to write, and then look up for a moment as if to remember the new name they want to use. That's what [McVeigh] did, and when he looked up I started talking to him, and it threw him.\"\n\n\nAfter an April 21, 1995, court hearing on the gun charges, but before McVeigh's release, federal agents took him into custody as they continued their investigation into the bombing. Rather than talk to investigators about the bombing, McVeigh demanded an attorney. Having been tipped off by the arrival of police and helicopters that a bombing suspect was inside, a restless crowd began to gather outside the jail. While McVeigh's requests for a bulletproof vest or transport by helicopter were denied, authorities did use a helicopter to transport him from Perry to Oklahoma City.\n\nFederal agents obtained a warrant to search the house of McVeigh's father, Bill, after which they broke down the door and wired the house and telephone with listening devices. FBI investigators used the resulting information gained, along with the fake address McVeigh had been using, to begin their search for the Nichols brothers, Terry and James. On April 21, 1995, Terry Nichols learned that he was being hunted, and turned himself in. Investigators discovered incriminating evidence at his home: ammonium nitrate and blasting caps, the electric drill used to drill out the locks at the quarry, books on bomb-making, a copy of Hunter (a 1989 novel by William Luther Pierce, the founder and chairman of the National Alliance, a white nationalist group) and a hand-drawn map of downtown Oklahoma City, on which the Murrah Building and the spot where McVeigh's getaway car was hidden were marked. After a nine-hour interrogation, Terry Nichols was formally held in federal custody until his trial. On April 25, 1995, James Nichols was also arrested, but he was released after 32\u00a0days due to lack of evidence. McVeigh's sister Jennifer was accused of illegally mailing bullets to McVeigh, but she was granted immunity in exchange for testifying against him.\n\nA Jordanian-American man traveling from his home in Oklahoma City to visit family in Jordan on April 19, 1995, was also arrested, amid concern that Middle Eastern terrorists could have been behind the attack. Further investigation cleared the man of any involvement in the bombing.\n\n==Casualties==\n\nAn estimated 646\u00a0people were inside the building when the bomb exploded. By the end of the day, 14 adults and 6 children were confirmed dead, and over 100 injured. The toll eventually reached 168\u00a0confirmed dead, not including an unmatched left leg that could have belonged to an unidentified 169th victim or could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg. Most of the deaths resulted from the collapse of the building, rather than the bomb blast itself. Those killed included 163 who were in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, one person in the Athenian Building, one woman in a parking lot across the street, a man and woman in the Oklahoma Water Resources building, and a rescue worker struck on the head by debris.\n\nThe victims, including three pregnant women, ranged in age from three months to 73 years. Of the dead, 108 worked for the Federal government: Drug Enforcement Administration (5); Secret Service (6); Department of Housing and Urban Development (35); Department of Agriculture (7); Customs Office (2); Department of Transportation\/Federal Highway (11); General Services Administration (2); and the Social Security Administration (40). Eight of the federal government victims were federal law enforcement agents. Of those law enforcement agents, four were members of the U.S. Secret Service, two were members of the U.S. Customs Service, one was a member of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and one was a member of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Six of the victims were U.S. military personnel; two members of the U.S. Army, two members of the U.S. Air Force, and two members of the U.S. Marine Corps. The rest of the victims were civilians, including 19 children, of whom 15 were in the America's Kids Day Care Center. The bodies of the 168\u00a0victims were identified at a temporary morgue set up at the scene. A team of 24 identified the victims using full-body X-rays, dental examinations, fingerprinting, blood tests, and DNA testing. More than 680 people were injured. The majority of the injuries were abrasions, severe burns, and bone fractures.\n\nMcVeigh's later response to the range of casualties was: \"I didn't define the rules of engagement in this conflict. The rules, if not written down, are defined by the aggressor. It was brutal, no holds barred. Women and kids were killed at Waco and Ruby Ridge. You put back in [the government's] faces exactly what they're giving out.\" He later stated \"I wanted the government to hurt like the people of Waco and Ruby Ridge had.\"\n\n==Response and relief==\n\n===Rescue efforts===\n\nAt 9:03\u00a0am, the first of over 1,800\u00a09-1-1 calls related to the bombing was received by Emergency Medical Services Authority (EMSA). By that time, EMSA ambulances, police, and firefighters had heard the blast and were already headed to the scene. Nearby civilians, who had also witnessed or heard the blast, arrived to assist the victims and emergency workers. Within 23\u00a0minutes of the bombing, the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) was set up, consisting of representatives from the state departments of public safety, human services, military, health, and education. Assisting the SEOC were agencies including the National Weather Service, the Air Force, the Civil Air Patrol, and the American Red Cross. Immediate assistance also came from 465\u00a0members of the Oklahoma National Guard, who arrived within the hour to provide security, and from members of the Department of Civil Emergency Management. Terrance Yeakey and  Jim Ramsey, from the Oklahoma City Police Department, were among the first officers to arrive at the site. Several cast and crew members filming for the 1996 movie Twister paused filming to come help with recovery efforts.\n\nThe EMS command post was set up almost immediately following the attack and oversaw triage, treatment, transportation, and decontamination. A simple plan\/objective was established: treatment and transportation of the injured was to be done as quickly as possible, supplies and personnel to handle a large number of patients was needed immediately, the dead needed to be moved to a temporary morgue until they could be transferred to the coroner's office, and measures for a long-term medical operation needed to be established. The triage center was set up near the Murrah Building and all the wounded were directed there. Two hundred and ten patients were transported from the primary triage center to nearby hospitals within the first couple hours following the bombing.\n\nWithin the first hour, 50\u00a0people were rescued from the Murrah Federal Building. Victims were sent to every hospital in the area. The day of the bombing, 153 people were treated at St. Anthony Hospital, eight blocks from the blast, over 70 people were treated at Presbyterian Hospital, 41 people were treated at University Hospital, and 18 people were treated at Children's Hospital. Temporary silences were observed at the blast site so that sensitive listening devices capable of detecting human heartbeats could be used to locate survivors. In some cases, limbs had to be amputated without anesthetics (avoided because of the potential to induce coma) in order to free those trapped under rubble. The scene had to be periodically evacuated as the police received tips claiming that other bombs had been planted in the building.\n\nAt 10:28\u00a0am, rescuers found what they believed to be a second bomb. Some rescue workers refused to leave until police ordered the mandatory evacuation of a four-block area around the site. The device was determined to be a three-foot (.9-m) long TOW missile used in the training of federal agents and bomb-sniffing dogs; although actually inert, it had been marked \"live\" in order to mislead arms traffickers in a planned law enforcement sting. On examination the missile was determined to be inert, and relief efforts resumed 45\u00a0minutes later. The last survivor, a 15-year-old girl found under the base of the collapsed building, was rescued at around 7\u00a0pm.\n\nIn the days following the blast, over 12,000\u00a0people participated in relief and rescue operations. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated 11 of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, bringing in 665\u00a0rescue workers. One nurse was killed in the rescue attempt after she was hit on the head by debris, and 26\u00a0other rescuers were hospitalized because of various injuries. Twenty-four K-9 units and out-of-state dogs were brought in to search for survivors and bodies in the building debris. In an effort to recover additional bodies,  of rubble were removed from the site each day from April 24 to 29.\n\n\nRescue and recovery efforts were concluded at 12:05\u00a0a.m. on May 5, by which time the bodies of all but three of the victims had been recovered. For safety reasons, the building was initially slated to be demolished shortly afterward. McVeigh's attorney, Stephen Jones, filed a motion to delay the demolition until the defense team could examine the site in preparation for the trial. At 7:02\u00a0a.m. on May 23, more than a month after the bombing, the Murrah Federal building was demolished. The EMS Command Center remained active and was staffed 24 hours a day until the demolition of the Federal Murrah Building. The final three bodies to be recovered were those of two credit union employees and a customer. For several days after the building's demolition, trucks hauled away  of debris a day from the site. Some of the debris was used as evidence in the conspirators' trials, incorporated into memorials, donated to local schools, or sold to raise funds for relief efforts.\n\n===Humanitarian aid===\nThe national humanitarian response was immediate, and in some cases even overwhelming. Large numbers of items such as wheelbarrows, bottled water, helmet lights, knee pads, rain gear, and even football helmets were donated. The sheer quantity of such donations caused logistical and inventory control problems until drop-off centers were set up to accept and sort the goods. The Oklahoma Restaurant Association, which was holding a trade show in the city, assisted rescue workers by providing 15,000 to 20,000\u00a0meals over a ten-day period.\n\nThe Salvation Army served over 100,000\u00a0meals and provided over 100,000\u00a0ponchos, gloves, hard hats, and knee pads to rescue workers. Local residents and those from further afield responded to the requests for blood donations. Of the over 9,000\u00a0units of blood donated 131\u00a0units were used; the rest were stored in blood banks.\n\n===Federal and state government aid===\n\nAt 9:45\u00a0am, Governor Frank Keating declared a state of emergency and ordered all non-essential workers in the Oklahoma City area to be released from their duties for their safety. President Bill Clinton learned about the bombing at around 9:30\u00a0a.m. while he was meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu \u00c7iller at the White House. Before addressing the nation, President Clinton considered grounding all planes in the Oklahoma City area to prevent the bombers from escaping by air, but decided against it. At 4:00\u00a0pm, President Clinton declared a federal emergency in Oklahoma City and spoke to the nation:\n\n\n\nHe ordered that flags for all federal buildings be flown at half-staff for 30\u00a0days in remembrance of the victims. Four days later, on April 23, 1995, Clinton spoke from Oklahoma City.\n\nNo major federal financial assistance was made available to the survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing, but the Murrah Fund set up in the wake of the bombing attracted over $300,000 in federal grants. Over $40\u00a0million was donated to the city to aid disaster relief and to compensate the victims. Funds were initially distributed to families who needed it to get back on their feet, and the rest was held in trust for longer-term medical and psychological needs. By 2005, $18\u00a0million of the donations remained, some of which was earmarked to provide a college education for each of the 219\u00a0children who lost one or both parents in the bombing. A committee chaired by Daniel Kurtenbach of Goodwill Industries provided financial assistance to the survivors.\n\n===International reaction===\nInternational reactions to the bombing varied. President Clinton received many messages of sympathy, including those from Queen Elizabeth\u00a0II of the United Kingdom, Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and Narasimha Rao of India. Iran condemned the bombing as an attack on innocent people, but also blamed the U.S. government's policies for inciting it. Other condolences came from Russia, Canada, Australia, the United Nations, and the European Union, among other nations and organizations.\n\nSeveral countries offered to assist in both the rescue efforts and the investigation. France offered to send a special rescue unit, and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin offered to send agents with anti-terrorist expertise to help in the investigation. President Clinton declined Israel's offer, believing that accepting it would increase anti-Muslim sentiments and endanger Muslim-Americans.\n\n===Children affected===\n\nIn the wake of the bombing, the national media focused on the fact that 19 of the victims had been babies and children, many in the day-care center. At the time of the bombing, there were 100\u00a0day-care centers in the United States in 7,900\u00a0federal buildings. McVeigh later stated that he was unaware of the day-care center when choosing the building as a target, and if he had known \"...\u00a0it might have given me pause to switch targets. That's a large amount of collateral damage.\" The FBI stated that McVeigh scouted the interior of the building in December 1994 and likely knew of the day-care center before the bombing. In April 2010, Joseph Hartzler, the prosecutor at McVeigh's trial, questioned how he could have decided to pass over a prior target building because of an included florist shop but at the Murrah building not \"...\u00a0notice that there's a child day-care center there, that there was a credit union there and a Social Security office?\"\n\nSchools across the country were dismissed early and ordered closed. A photograph of firefighter Chris Fields emerging from the rubble with infant Baylee Almon, who later died in a nearby hospital, was reprinted worldwide and became a symbol of the attack. The photo, taken by bank employee Charles H. Porter\u00a0IV, won the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography and appeared on newspapers and magazines for months following the attack.\nAren Almon Kok, mother of Baylee Almon, said of the photo: \"It was very hard to go to stores because they are in the check out aisle. It was always there. It was devastating. Everybody had seen my daughter dead. And that's all she became to them. She was a symbol. She was the girl in the fireman's arms. But she was a real person that got left behind.\"\n\nThe images and media reports of children dying terrorized many children who, as demonstrated by later research, showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Children became a primary focus of concern in the mental health response to bombing and many bomb related services were delivered to the community, young and old alike. These services were delivered to public schools of Oklahoma and reached approximately 40,000 students. One of the first organized mental health activities in Oklahoma City was a clinical study of middle and high school students conducted 7 weeks after the bombing. The study focused on middle and high school students who had no connection or relation to the victims of the bombing. This study showed that these students, although deeply moved by the event and showing a sense of vulnerability on the matter, had no difficulty with the demands of school or home life, contrasting those who were connected to the bombing and its victims, who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nChildren were also affected through the loss of parents in the bombing. Many children lost one or more parents in the blast, with a reported seven children who lost their only remaining parent. Children of the disaster have been raised by single parents, foster parents, and other family members. Adjusting to the loss has made these children suffer psychologically and emotionally. One interview revealed the sleepless nights and obsession with death of one of the at least ten orphaned children.\n\nPresident Clinton stated that after seeing images of babies being pulled from the wreckage, he was \"beyond angry\" and wanted to \"put [his] fist through the television\". Clinton and his wife Hillary requested that aides talk to child care specialists about how to communicate with the children regarding the bombing. President Clinton spoke to the nation three days after the bombing, saying: \"I don't want our children to believe something terrible about life and the future and grownups in general because of this awful thing\u00a0... most adults are good people who want to protect our children in their childhood and we are going to get through this\". On April 22, 1995, the Clintons spoke in the White House with over 40\u00a0federal agency employees and their children, and in a live nationwide television and radio broadcast, addressed their concerns.\n\n===Media coverage===\nHundreds of news trucks and members of the press arrived at the site to cover the story. The press immediately noticed that the bombing took place on the second anniversary of the Waco incident. \n\nMany initial news stories hypothesized the attack had been undertaken by Islamic terrorists, such as those who had masterminded the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Some media reported that investigators wanted to question men of Middle Eastern appearance. Hamzi Moghrabi, chairman of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, blamed the media for harassment of Muslims and Arabs that took place after the bombing.\n\nAs the rescue effort wound down, the media interest shifted to the investigation, arrests, and trials of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, and on the search for an additional suspect named \"John Doe Number Two.\" Several witnesses claimed to have seen a second suspect, who did not resemble Nichols, with McVeigh.\n\nThose who expressed sympathy for McVeigh typically described his deed as an act of war, as in the case of Gore Vidal's essay The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh.\n\n==Trials and sentencing of the conspirators==\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) led the official investigation, known as OKBOMB, with Weldon L. Kennedy acting as special agent in charge. Kennedy oversaw 900\u00a0federal, state, and local law enforcement personnel including 300\u00a0FBI agents, 200\u00a0officers from the Oklahoma City Police Department, 125\u00a0members of the Oklahoma National Guard, and 55\u00a0officers from the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety. The crime task force was deemed the largest since the investigation into the assassination of John F. Kennedy. OKBOMB was the largest criminal case in America's history, with FBI agents conducting 28,000\u00a0interviews, amassing  of evidence, and collecting nearly one billion\u00a0pieces of information. Federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ordered that the venue for the trial be moved from Oklahoma City to Denver, Colorado, citing that the defendants would be unable to receive a fair trial in Oklahoma. The investigation led to the separate trials and convictions of McVeigh, Nichols, and Fortier.\n\n===Timothy McVeigh===\n\nOpening statements in McVeigh's trial began on April 24, 1997. The United States was represented by a team of prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler. In his opening statement Hartzler outlined McVeigh's motivations, and the evidence against him. McVeigh, he said, had developed a hatred of the government during his time in the army, after reading The Turner Diaries. His beliefs were supported by what he saw as the militia's ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of the Brady Bill, and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents. The prosecution called 137\u00a0witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh's sister, Jennifer McVeigh, all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh's hatred of the government and his desire to take militant action against it. Both Fortiers testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Michael revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date, and Lori testified that she created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck.\n\nMcVeigh was represented by a defense counsel team of six principal attorneys led by Stephen Jones. According to law professor Douglas O. Linder, McVeigh wanted Jones to present a \"necessity defense\"\u00a0\u2013 which would argue that he was in \"imminent danger\" from the government (that his bombing was intended to prevent future crimes by the government, such as the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents). McVeigh argued that \"imminent\" does not mean \"immediate\": \"If a comet is hurtling toward the earth, and it's out past the orbit of Pluto, it's not an immediate threat to Earth, but it is an imminent threat.\" Despite McVeigh's wishes, Jones attempted to discredit the prosecution's case in an attempt to instill reasonable doubt. Jones also believed that McVeigh was part of a larger conspiracy, and sought to present him as \"the designated patsy\", but McVeigh disagreed with Jones arguing that rationale for his defense. After a hearing, Judge Matsch independently ruled the evidence concerning a larger conspiracy to be too insubstantial to be admissible. In addition to arguing that the bombing could not have been carried out by two men alone, Jones also attempted to create reasonable doubt by arguing that no one had seen McVeigh near the scene of the crime, and that the investigation into the bombing had lasted only two weeks. Jones presented 25\u00a0witnesses over a one-week period, including  Frederic Whitehurst. Although Whitehurst described the FBI's sloppy investigation of the bombing site and its handling of other key evidence, he was unable to point to any direct evidence that he knew to be contaminated.\n\nA key point of contention in the case was the unmatched left leg found after the bombing. Although it was initially believed to be from a male, it was later determined to be that of Lakesha Levy, a female member of the Air Force who was killed in the bombing. Levy's coffin had to be re-opened so that her leg could replace another unmatched leg that had previously been buried with her remains. The unmatched leg had been embalmed, which prevented authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine the leg's owner. Jones argued that the leg could have belonged to another bomber, possibly John Doe No. 2. The prosecution disputed the claim, saying that the leg could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg.\n\nNumerous damaging leaks, which appeared to originate from conversations between McVeigh and his defense attorneys, emerged. They included a confession said to have been inadvertently included on a computer disk that was given to the press, which McVeigh believed seriously compromised his chances of getting a fair trial. A gag order was imposed during the trial, prohibiting attorneys on either side from commenting to the press on the evidence, proceedings, or opinions regarding the trial proceedings. The defense was allowed to enter into evidence six pages of a 517-page Justice Department report criticizing the FBI crime laboratory and David Williams, one of the agency's explosives experts, for reaching unscientific and biased conclusions. The report claimed that Williams had worked backward in the investigation rather than basing his determinations on forensic evidence.\n\nThe jury deliberated for 23\u00a0hours. On June 2, 1997, McVeigh was found guilty on 11\u00a0counts of murder and conspiracy. Although the defense argued for a reduced sentence of life imprisonment, McVeigh was sentenced to death. In May 2001, the Justice Department announced that the FBI had mistakenly failed to provide over 3,000\u00a0documents to McVeigh's defense counsel. The Justice Department also announced that the execution would be postponed for one month for the defense to review the documents. On June 6, federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ruled the documents would not prove McVeigh innocent and ordered the execution to proceed. McVeigh invited conductor David Woodard to perform pre-requiem Mass music on the eve of his execution; while reproachful of McVeigh's capital wrongdoing, Woodard consented. After President George W. Bush approved the execution (McVeigh was a federal inmate and federal law dictates that the president must approve the execution of federal prisoners), he was executed by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute in Terre Haute, Indiana, on June 11, 2001. The execution was transmitted on closed-circuit television so that the relatives of the victims could witness his death. McVeigh's execution was the first federal execution in 38\u00a0years.\n\n===Terry Nichols===\n\nNichols stood trial twice. He was first tried by the federal government in 1997 and found guilty of conspiring to build a weapon of mass destruction and of eight counts of involuntary manslaughter of federal officers. After he was sentenced on June 4, 1998 to life without parole, the State of Oklahoma in 2000 sought a death-penalty conviction on 161\u00a0counts of first-degree murder (160\u00a0non-federal agent victims and one\u00a0fetus). On May 26, 2004 the jury found him guilty on all charges, but deadlocked on the issue of sentencing him to death. Presiding Judge Steven W. Taylor then determined the sentence of 161\u00a0consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole. In March 2005, FBI investigators, acting on a tip, searched a buried crawl space in Nichols's former house and found additional explosives missed in the preliminary search after Nichols was arrested.\n\n===Michael and Lori Fortier===\nMichael and Lori Fortier were considered accomplices for their foreknowledge of the planning of the bombing. In addition to Michael assisting McVeigh in scouting the federal building, Lori had helped McVeigh laminate a fake driver's license which was later used to rent the Ryder truck. Michael agreed to testify against McVeigh and Nichols in exchange for a reduced sentence and immunity for his wife. He was sentenced on May 27, 1998 to 12\u00a0years in prison and fined $75,000 for failing to warn authorities about the attack. On January 20, 2006, after serving ten and a half years of his sentence, including time already served, Fortier was released for good behavior into the Witness Protection Program and given a new identity.\n\n===Others===\nNo \"John Doe #2\" was ever identified, nothing conclusive was ever reported regarding the owner of the unmatched leg, and the government never openly investigated anyone else in conjunction with the bombing. Although the defense teams in both McVeigh's and Nichols's trials suggested that others were involved, Judge Steven W. Taylor found no credible, relevant, or legally admissible evidence, of anyone other than McVeigh and Nichols having directly participated in the bombing. When McVeigh was asked if there were other conspirators in the bombing, he replied: \"You can't handle the truth! Because the truth is, I blew up the Murrah Building, and isn't it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell?\" On the morning of McVeigh's execution a letter was released in which he had written \"For those die-hard conspiracy theorists who will refuse to believe this, I turn the tables and say: Show me where I needed anyone else. Financing? Logistics? Specialized tech skills? Brainpower? Strategy? ... Show me where I needed a dark, mysterious 'Mr. X'!\"\n\n==Aftermath==\nWithin 48\u00a0hours of the attack, and with the assistance of the General Services Administration (GSA), the targeted federal offices were able to resume operations in other parts of the city. According to Mark Potok, director of Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, his organization tracked another 60\u00a0domestic smaller-scale terrorism plots from 1995 to 2005. Several of the plots were uncovered and prevented while others caused various infrastructure damage, deaths, or other destruction. Potok revealed that in 1996 there were approximately 858\u00a0domestic militias and other antigovernment groups but the number had dropped to 152 by 2004. Shortly after the bombing, the FBI hired an additional 500\u00a0agents to investigate potential domestic terrorist attacks.\n\n===Legislation===\nIn the wake of the bombing the U.S. government enacted several pieces of legislation including the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. In response to the trials of the conspirators being moved out-of-state, the Victim Allocution Clarification Act of 1997 was signed on March 20, 1997 by President Clinton to allow the victims of the bombing (and the victims of any other future acts of violence) the right to observe trials and to offer impact testimony in sentencing hearings. In response to passing the legislation, Clinton stated that \"when someone is a victim, he or she should be at the center of the criminal justice process, not on the outside looking in.\"\n\nIn the years since the bombing, scientists, security experts, and the ATF have called on Congress to develop legislation that would require customers to produce identification when purchasing ammonium nitrate fertilizer, and for sellers to maintain records of its sale. Critics argue that farmers lawfully use large quantities of the fertilizer, and as of 2009, only Nevada and South Carolina require identification from purchasers. In June 1995, Congress enacted legislation requiring chemical taggants to be incorporated into dynamite and other explosives so that a bomb could be traced to its manufacturer. In 2008, Honeywell announced that it had developed a nitrogen-based fertilizer that would not detonate when mixed with fuel oil. The company got assistance from the Department of Homeland Security to develop the fertilizer (Sulf-N 26) for commercial use. It uses ammonium sulfate to make the fertilizer less explosive.\n\n====Oklahoma School Curriculum====\nIn the decade following the bombing, there was criticism of Oklahoma public schools for not requiring the bombing to be covered in the curriculum of mandatory Oklahoma history classes. Oklahoma History is a one-semester course required by state law for graduation from high school; however, the bombing was only covered for one to two pages at most in textbooks. The state's PASS standards (Priority Academic Student Skills) did not require that a student learn about the bombing, and focused more on other subjects such as corruption and the Dust Bowl. On April 6, 2010, House Bill 2750 was signed by Governor Brad Henry, requiring the bombing to be entered into the school curriculum for Oklahoma, U.S. and world history classes.\n\nOn the signing, Governor Henry said \"Although the events of April 19, 1995 may be etched in our minds and in the minds of Oklahomans who remember that day, we have a generation of Oklahomans that has little to no memory of the events of that day ... We owe it to the victims, the survivors and all of the people touched by this tragic event to remember April 19, 1995 and understand what it meant and still means to this state and this nation.\"\n\n===Building security and construction===\n\nIn the weeks following the bombing the federal government ordered that all federal buildings in all major cities be surrounded with prefabricated Jersey barriers to prevent similar attacks. As part of a longer-term plan for United States federal building security most of those temporary barriers have since been replaced with permanent and more aesthetically considerate security barriers, which are driven deep into the ground for sturdiness. Furthermore, all new federal buildings must now be constructed with truck-resistant barriers and with deep setbacks from surrounding streets to minimize their vulnerability to truck bombs. FBI buildings, for instance, must be set back  from traffic. The total cost of improving security in federal buildings across the country in response to the bombing reached over $600\u00a0million.\n\nThe Murrah Federal Building had been considered so safe that it only employed one security guard. In June 1995, the DOJ issued Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities, also known as The Marshals Report, the findings of which resulted in a thorough evaluation of security at all federal buildings and a system for classifying risks at over 1,300\u00a0federal facilities owned or leased by the federal government. Federal sites were divided into five security levels ranging from Level 1 (minimum security needs) to Level 5 (maximum). The Alfred P. Murrah Building was deemed a Level 4 building. Among the 52\u00a0security improvements were physical barriers, closed-circuit television monitoring, site planning and access, hardening of building exteriors to increase blast resistance, glazing systems to reduce flying glass shards and fatalities, and structural engineering design to prevent progressive collapse.\n\nThe attack led to engineering improvements allowing buildings to better withstand tremendous forces, improvements which were incorporated into the design of Oklahoma City's new federal building. The National Geographic Channel documentary series Seconds From Disaster suggested that the Murrah Federal Building would probably have survived the blast had it been built according to California's earthquake design codes.\n\n===Impact according to McVeigh===\nMcVeigh believed that the bomb attack had a positive impact on government policy. In evidence he cited the peaceful resolution of the Montana Freemen standoff in 1996, the government's $3.1\u00a0million settlement with Randy Weaver and his surviving children four months after the bombing, and April 2000 statements by Bill Clinton regretting his decision to storm the Branch Davidian compound. McVeigh stated, \"Once you bloody the bully's nose, and he knows he's going to be punched again, he's not coming back around.\"\n\n===Conspiracy theories===\n\nA variety of conspiracy theories have been proposed about the events surrounding the bombing. Some theories allege that individuals in the government, including President Bill Clinton, knew of the impending bombing and intentionally failed to act. Other theories focus on initial reports by local news stations of multiple other unexploded bombs within the building itself as evidence of remnants of a controlled demolition; following the attack, search and rescue operations at the site were delayed until the area had been declared safe by the Oklahoma City bomb squad and federal authorities. According to both a situation report compiled by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and a memo issued by the United States Atlantic Command the day following the attack, a second bomb located within the building was disarmed while a third was evacuated. Further theories focus on additional conspirators involved with the bombing. Additional theories claim the bombing was carried out by the government in order to frame the militia movement or to provide the impetus for new antiterrorism legislation while using McVeigh as a scapegoat. Other conspiracy theories suggest that foreign agents, particularly Islamic terrorists but also the Japanese government or German Neo-Nazis, were involved in the bombing. Experts have disputed the theories and government investigations have been opened at various times to look into the theories.\n\n==Evacuation issues==\nOnce the explosion took place at the Alfred P. Murrah building, chaotic response filled the surrounding streets. Those who were able to flee the Murrah building did so, while others, stuck in the rubble, awaited the assistance of rescue workers and volunteers. As reported on CNN, other federal buildings in the downtown area were not fully evacuated, but those who were able to leave the city were encouraged to do so. This traffic, along with the people leaving places around the Murrah Building clogged streets, delaying the arrival of rescue crews and relief agencies.\nSeveral agencies, including the Federal Highway Administration and the City of Oklahoma City have evaluated the emergency response actions to the bombing, and have proposed plans for a better response in addition to addressing issues that hindered a smooth rescue effort. Because of the crowded streets, and the number of response agencies sent to the location, communication between government branches and rescue workers was muddled. Groups were unaware of the operations others were conducting, thus creating strife and delays in the search and rescue process. The City of Oklahoma City, in their After Action Report, declared that better communication and single bases for agencies would better the aid of those in disastrous situations.\nFollowing the events of September 11, 2001, with consideration of other events including the Oklahoma City Bombing, the Federal Highway Administration proposed the idea that major metropolitan areas create evacuation routes for civilians. These highlighted routes would allow paths for emergency crews and government agencies to enter the disaster area more quickly. By helping civilians out, and rescue workers in, the number of casualties will hopefully be decreased.\n\n==Memorial observances==\n\n===Oklahoma City National Memorial===\n\nFor two\u00a0years after the bombing the only memorials to the victims were plush toys, crucifixes, letters, and other personal items left by thousands of people at a security fence surrounding the site of the building. Many suggestions for suitable memorials were sent to Oklahoma City, but an official memorial planning committee was not set up until early 1996, when the Murrah Federal Building Memorial Task Force, composed of 350\u00a0members, was set up to formulate plans for a memorial to commemorate the victims of the bombing. On July 1, 1997 the winning design was chosen unanimously by a 15-member panel from 624\u00a0submissions. The memorial was designed at a cost of $29\u00a0million, which was raised by public and private funds. The national memorial is part of the National Park System as an affiliated area and was designed by Oklahoma City architects Hans and Torrey Butzer and Sven Berg. It was dedicated by President Clinton on April 19, 2000, exactly five years after the bombing. Within the first year, it had 700,000\u00a0visitors.\n\nThe memorial includes a reflecting pool flanked by two large gates, one inscribed with the time 9:01, the other with 9:03, the pool representing the moment of the blast. On the south end of the memorial is a field of symbolic bronze and stone chairs\u00a0\u2013 one for each person lost, arranged according to what floor of the building they were on. The chairs represent the empty chairs at the dinner tables of the victims' families. The seats of the children killed are smaller than those of the adults lost. On the opposite side is the \"survivor tree\", part of the building's original landscaping that survived the blast and fires that followed it. The memorial left part of the foundation of the building intact, allowing visitors to see the scale of the destruction. Part of the chain link fence put in place around the site of the blast, which had attracted over 800,000\u00a0personal items of commemoration later collected by the Oklahoma City Memorial Foundation, is now on the western edge of the memorial. North of the memorial is the Journal Record Building, which now houses the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum, an affiliate of the National Park Service. The building also contains the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, a law enforcement training center.\n\n\n\n===St. Joseph's Old Cathedral===\nSt. Joseph's Old Cathedral, one of the first brick-and-mortar churches in the city, is located to the southwest of the memorial and was severely damaged by the blast. To commemorate the event, a statue and sculpture work entitled And Jesus Wept was installed adjacent to the Oklahoma City National Memorial. The work was dedicated in May 1997 and the church was rededicated on December 1 of the same year. The church, the statue, and the sculpture are not part of the Oklahoma City memorial.\n\n===Remembrance observance===\nAn observance is held each year to remember the victims of the bombing. An annual marathon draws thousands, and allows runners to sponsor a victim of the bombing. For the tenth anniversary of the bombing, the city held 24\u00a0days of activities, including a week-long series of events known as the National Week of Hope from April 17 to 24, 2005. As in previous years, the tenth anniversary of the bombing observances began with a service at 9:02\u00a0am, marking the moment the bomb went off, with the traditional 168\u00a0seconds of silence\u00a0\u2013 one\u00a0second for each person who was killed as a result of the blast. The service also included the traditional reading of the names, read by children to symbolize the future of Oklahoma City.\n\nVice President Dick Cheney, former President Clinton, Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry, Frank Keating, Governor of Oklahoma at the time of the bombing, and other political dignitaries attended the service and gave speeches in which they emphasized that \"goodness overcame evil\". The relatives of the victims and the survivors of the blast also made note of it during the service at First United Methodist Church in Oklahoma City.\n\nPresident George W. Bush made note of the anniversary in a written statement, part of which echoed his remarks on the execution of Timothy McVeigh in 2001: \"For the survivors of the crime and for the families of the dead the pain goes on.\" Bush was invited but did not attend the service because he was en route to Springfield, Illinois, to dedicate the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. Cheney attended the service in his place.\n\nDue to COVID-19 and 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic, the memorial site was closed to the public on April 19, 2020, and local television networks broadcast pre-recorded remembrances to mark the 25th anniversary.\n\n==See also==\n\n* List of terrorist incidents\n* Lone wolf (terrorism), a term to describe non-state actor terrorists that commit violence without any specific link to an organization.\n* 2011 Oslo bombing, lone wolf attack against government offices, using similar explosives and killing 77 people.\n* AMIA bombing\n* September 11 attacks, the deadliest instance of terrorism in the United States.\n\n==References==\n\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n\n==External links==\n\n*  Oklahoma City National Memorial official website\n*  The Denver Post: Oklahoma City Bombing Trial\n* \n*  List of victims of the bombing\n* \n*  Text, audio, and video of President Clinton's Oklahoma Bombing Memorial address\n*  Interactive timeline of the bombing events\n*  Terror Hits Home: The Oklahoma City Bombing from the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n*  The Oklahoma City Bombing 20 Years Later from the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n*  Voices of Oklahoma interview with Stephen Jones.

{"title":"1993 Bombay bombings","article":"The 1993 Bombay bombings were a series of 12 bomb explosions that took place in Mumbai, India, then known as Bombay, on 12 March 1993. The single-day attacks resulted in 317 fatalities and 1,400 injuries.\n\nThe attacks were reported to be coordinated by Dawood Ibrahim, leader of the Mumbai-based international organised crime syndicate D-Company. Ibrahim was believed to have ordered and helped organize the bombings through his subordinates Tiger Memon and Yakub Memon.\n\nThe Supreme Court of India gave its judgement on 21 March 2013, after over 20 years of judicial proceedings, upholding the death sentence against suspected ringleader Yakub Memon while commuting the previous death sentences against 10 others to life in prison. However, two of the main suspects in the case, Ibrahim and Tiger Memon, have not yet been arrested or tried. After India's three-judge Supreme Court bench rejected his curative petition, saying the grounds raised by him do not fall within the principles laid down by the apex court in 2002, the Maharashtra state government executed Yakub Memon on 30 July 2015.\n\n==Introduction==\n\n===Background===\nIn December 1992 and January 1993, there was widespread rioting throughout the nation following the Babri Masjid demolition in Ayodhya, where some of the most notable riots occurred in Mumbai. Five years after the December\u2013January riots, the Srikrishna Commission report found that 900 individuals had died and over 2,000 had been injured.\n\n===Confession of Gul Mohammed===\nOn 9 March 1993, three days before the bombings took place, a small-time criminal from the Behrampada slum in Northeast Mumbai named Gul Noor Mohammad Sheikh (Gullu) was detained at the Nag Pada police station. A participant in the communal riots that had rocked Mumbai the previous year, Gullu was also one of the 19 men handpicked by Tiger Memon, a silver smuggler and chief mastermind of the bombings, for training in the use of guns and bomb making.\n\nGullu had been sent to Pakistan via Dubai on 19 February 1993 and upon completion of his training returned to Mumbai on 4 March. In his absence the police had detained Gullu's brothers to encourage him to surrender, which he did. He confessed to his role in the riots, his training in Pakistan, and a conspiracy underway to bomb major locations around the city, including the Bombay Stock Exchange, Sahar International Airport and the Sena Bhavan. However, his conspiracy claim was dismissed by the police as \"mere bluff\".\n\nThe arrest of Gul Mohammed spurred Tiger Memon to advance the date of the bombings which had originally been planned to coincide with the Shiv Jayanti celebrations in April 1993.\n\n==The bombings==\nAt 1:30\u00a0p.m. on 12 March 1993, a powerful car bomb exploded in the basement of the Bombay Stock Exchange building. The 28-storey office building was severely damaged and many nearby office buildings also suffered damage. Reports indicate that 50 were killed by this explosion. About 30\u00a0minutes later, another car bomb exploded in front of the Mandvi branch of Corporation Bank near Masjid. From 1:30\u00a0p.m. to 3:40\u00a0p.m. a total of 12 bombs exploded throughout Mumbai. Most of the bombs were car bombs but some were in scooters.\n\nThree hotels \u2013 the Hotel Sea Rock, Hotel Juhu Centaur, and Hotel Airport Centaur \u2013 were targeted by suitcase bombs left in rooms booked by the perpetrators. Banks, the regional passport office, the Air India Building, and a major shopping complex were also hit. Bombs exploded at Zaveri Bazaar and opposite it a jeep-bomb exploded at the Century Bazaar. Grenades were thrown at Sahar International Airport and at Fishermen's Colony, apparently targeting certain citizens at the latter. A double-decker bus was very badly damaged in the deadliest explosion, with as many as 90 people killed.\n\nThe locations attacked:\n\n* Fisherman's Colony in Mahim causeway\n* Zaveri Bazaar Fort\n* Plaza Cinema Dadar\n* Century Bazaar\n* Katha Bazaar\n* Hotel Sea Rock\n* Terminal at Sahar Airport (now Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport [CSIA])\n* Air India Building\n* Hotel Juhu Centaur\n* Worli\n* Bombay Stock Exchange Building Fort\n* Passport Office\n* Masjid-Mandvi Corporation Bank Branch\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe official number of fatalities was 257 with 1,400 others injured (some sources reported that 317 people died; this misreport was due to a bomb which killed 69 in Calcutta on 16 March and was not part of 12 March Bombay bombings).\n\nOn 10 July 2006, the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Sharad Pawar, admitted that he had \"deliberately misled\" people following the 1993 Mumbai bombings by saying there were \"13 and not 12\" explosions and had added the name of a Muslim-dominated locality to show that people from both communities had been affected. He attempted to justify this deception by claiming that it was a move to prevent communal riots by falsely portraying that both Hindu and Muslim communities in the city had been affected adversely. He also admitted to lying about evidence recovered and misleading people into believing that it pointed to the Tamil Tigers as possible suspects.\n\nThe bombings also caused a major rift within D-Company, the most powerful criminal organisation in the Mumbai underworld, headed by Dawood Ibrahim. Infuriated at the bombings, Ibrahim's right-hand man, Chotta Rajan, split from the organisation and took most of the leadership-level Hindu aides with him, including Sadhu, Jaspal Singh and Mohan Kotiyan. Rajan's split divided the Mumbai underworld along communal lines and pitted Chhota Rajan's predominantly Hindu gang against Dawood Ibrahim's predominantly Muslim D-Company. The ensuing gang war took the lives of more than a hundred gangsters and continues in 2017. Seven of the accused (Salim Kurla, Majeed Khan, Shakil Ahmed, Mohammed Jindran, Hanif Kadawala, Akbar Abu Sama Khan and Mohammed Latif) were assassinated by Rajan's hitmen.\n\n==Arrests, convictions and verdict==\nMany hundreds of people were arrested and detained in the Indian courts. In 2006, 100 of 129 accused were found to be guilty and were convicted by Justice PD Kode of the specially designated Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) court. Many of those convicted have eluded custody, including the mastermind of the attacks, Tiger Memon.\n\nOn 12 September 2006, the special TADA court convicted four members of the Memon family on charges of conspiring and abetting acts of terror. They face jail terms from five years to life imprisonment, that would be determined based on the severity of their crime. Three other members of the Memon family were acquitted with the judge giving them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nYakub Memon was charged for possession of unauthorised arms. After the bombings, family members of Tiger Memon, including Yakub, escaped to Dubai and Pakistan. Correspondents say Tiger owned a restaurant in Mumbai and was allegedly closely associated with Dawood Ibrahim, the suspected mastermind.\n\nExcept for Tiger and Yakub, the entire family returned to India and were promptly arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation in 1994. Yakub was later taken into custody and was undergoing treatment for depression. The Memon family was tried in court and found guilty of conspiracy. The defence lawyers asked for leniency in the sentencing and caused delays in the process.\n\nYakub Memon was executed by hanging in Nagpur Central Jail at 6:35\u00a0a.m. IST on 30 July 2015.\n\nTwo of the accused, Mohammed Umar Khatlab and Badshah Khan (pseudonym given by the prosecution to hide his real identity) turned state approvers.\n\nDawood Ibrahim, believed to have masterminded the terrorist attacks, is the Don of the Mumbai organised crime syndicate D-Company. He is suspected of having connections to terrorist elements such as al-Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden, as well as Lashkar-e-Toiba, and was declared a terrorist by the governments of India and the United States in 2003. Ibrahim is now wanted by Interpol as a part of the worldwide terror syndicate of Osama bin Laden. He has been in hiding since the bombings and is believed to be hiding in Pakistan, which the Pakistani government denies just as they denied presence of Osama Bin Laden on its soil. The Bush administration in the United States imposed sanctions on Ibrahim in 2006.\n\nThe penalty stage of the longest-running trial in India's history continued. In February 2007, prosecutors asked for the death penalty for 44 of the 100 convicted. The prosecution also requested the death penalty for those convicted of conspiracy in the case.\nAsghar Yusuf Mukadam and Shahnawaz Qureshi, who have been found guilty for involvement in the bombings pleaded for leniency, claiming that they were not terrorists and were emotionally driven to participate in the act. Mukadam claimed that the main conspirators took advantage of his \"frame of mind\" after the demolition of Babri Masjid and the subsequent riots, alleging police partiality during the riots. \"Vested interests\" instigated him to act as he did. Quareshi was trained in Pakistan to handle arms and ammunition. He and Muquddam parked the explosive-filled vehicle at Plaza cinema which resulted in 10 deaths and 37 injuries. Qureshi reached Pakistan via Dubai, where he claims he was taken \"under the pretext of providing\u00a0... an alternative job\". He claims that his house was set on fire during the riots.\n\nSome of the conspirators who managed to flee India after the bombings were arrested and extradited to India. These conspirators were declared absconders during the course of the trial. Abu Salem, Mustafa Dossa, Firoz Khan, Taher Merchant, Riyaz Siddiqui, Karimullah Khan, and Abdul Qayoom amongst others were arrested and the trial continued against these absconders in a special TADA court in Mumbai. Ujjwal Nikam who was earlier the Special Prosecutor in these case was replaced by Deepak Salvi to continue with the trial in the light of the subsequent developments. On 16 June 2017 gangster Mustafa Dossa and Firoz Khan were found guilty of conspiracy, which can carry the death penalty. On 26 June 2017 Dossa died of cardiac arrest in a Mumbai Hospital. Qayoom Sheikh was acquitted due to lack of evidence.\n\n===The Memons===\n* Yakub Memon was held in prison beginning in 1994. He was convicted for conspiracy: arranging and financing training and purchasing vehicles used for the bombings. He was sentenced to death in July 2007 and was executed by hanging on 30 July 2015 at 6:35\u00a0a.m. IST at Nagpur Jail.\n* Isa and Yusuf Memon, brothers of Yakub, were both charged for using their residence to host conspiracy meetings and store arms and explosives. Yusuf also provided his van to plant bombs. Isa was sentenced to life imprisonment on October 2006. Yusuf, a chronic schizophrenia patient, was also sentenced to life imprisonment. As of 2015 both were in Harsul Central Jail in Aurangabad, Maharashtra. Yusuf died of a heart attack on 26 June 2020.\n* Rubina Memon. Her Maruti car was the first piece of evidence in the trial. She was convicted of allowing the use of her vehicle to deliver explosives and received a life sentence.\n* Three members of the Memon family \u2013 Suleiman, Hanifa and Raheen \u2013 were acquitted with the judge giving them the benefit of doubt.\n\n===The bomb planters===\nThe prosecution had sought the death sentence for all of the following except Imtiaz Ghavate. As he is HIV positive, the prosecution sought a lesser sentence for him.\n\n* Shoaib Ghansar, Asghar Mukadam's cousin, was convicted of putting RDX explosive in a scooter and planting it in Zaveri Bazaar where the explosion killed 17 and injured 57. He was sentenced to death on 19 July 2007.\n* Asghar Mukadam and Shahnawaz Qureshi planted an RDX-laden van in Plaza Cinema that killed 10 and injured 37 others. Mukadam loaded RDX in vehicles and disbursed money to conspirators while Qureshi undertook arms training and loaded contraband.  Both were sentenced to death on 19 July 2007.\n* Abdul Ghani Turk was found guilty of loading RDX explosive into a jeep and parking it at Century Bazaar killing 113 and injuring 227. He was sentenced to death on 18 July 2007.\n* Parvez Shaikh was found guilty of parking a bomb in Katha Bazaar that killed 4, and planting a bomb in Hotel Sea Rock that destroyed 9 crores ( 90\u00a0million) of property. He was sentenced to death on 18 July 2007.\n* Mohammed Iqbal Mohammed Yusuf Shaikh was convicted for throwing hand grenades in Sahar airport, parking an unexploded RDX-laden scooter in Naigaon, and loading RDX in vehicles. He was sentenced to death on 20 July 2007.\n* Naseem Barmare was found guilty of hurling hand grenades at Sahara airport, parking an unexploded scooter at Naigaum, weapons training, conspiracy, and preparing bombs. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and fined  2,30,000.\n* Mohammed Farooq Pawale planted an RDX-laden car at Air-India Building killing 20 and injuring 84, parked an RDX-laden van near Sena Bhavan killing 4 and injuring 50, participated in arms training and landing of arms and ammunition. He was sentenced to death on 25 July 2007.\n* Mushtaq Tarani participated in a meeting at hotel Taj Mahal and did a reconnaissance of the bombing sites. He planted bomb at Hotel Juhu Centaur injuring 3 and causing loss of property worth 2.10 crore ( 21\u00a0million) and planted an unexploded scooter at Sheikh Memen street in Zaveri Bazaar.  He was sentenced to death on 18 July 2007.\n* Imtiaz Ghavate planted an unexploded RDX-laden scooter at Dhanji street in South Mumbai, landed explosives, arms and ammunition, and was present where bombs were readied. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of  2,27,000.\n\nIn March 2013, most of these death sentences awarded by the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act court were commuted to life in prison until death by the Supreme Court of India. Only the death sentence of Yakub Memon was upheld.\n\n===Accused involved===\nMohammed Moin Qureshi, Feroz Amani Malik, Bashir Khairulla, Zakir Hussain and Abdul Akhtar Khan had thrown hand grenades in Mahim Causeway causing 3 deaths and injuring 6. The driver, Salim Shaikh, did not throw any hand grenades.\n\n* Bashir Khairulla was convicted for his participation in arms, ammunition and explosives training, conspirators' meetings, and filling of RDX in the vehicles. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on 20 July 2007.\n* Zakir Hussain was convicted for participating in the arms, ammunition and weapon training, conspirators' meetings and filling of RDX.

He was also found guilty for possession of 17 hand grenades. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on 24 July 2007.\n\n===Landing agents===\n* Dawood Phanse,  Dawood Taklya (Dawood Baldie), was found guilty of conspiracy, organising the landing of arms, ammunition and the nearly  of RDX at Shekhadi in Raigad district on 3 and 7 February 1993 and attending a conspiracy meeting in Dubai with Dawood Ibrahim and Tiger Memon. Due to his old age, he was given two life sentences (to be served concurrently) and fined 2 lakhs ( 200,000).\n* Sharif Abdul Gafoor Parkar, a.k.a. Dadabhai, was found guilty of bribing officials and police at Raigad to assist in the landing of RDX, arms and ammunition at Shekhadi, showed training camps at Sandheri and Bhor Ghat, and transportation of consignment. He was sentenced to 14\u00a0years imprisonment as he was aware of the content of the contraband, but acquitted of conspiracy. He was also fined  2,00,000, defaulting which he would have to serve three more years.\n\n===Customs officials===\n* S.N. Thapa, a former additional customs collector, was convicted for obtaining information about the landing at Shekhadi and identifying the main exit point. He is alleged to have laid a trap at Purarphata on Mhasla-Goregaon road on 30 January. Additionally, his team left their watch after 2 February in spite of warnings. However, confessions of some co-accused suggest that the landing took place many days after Thapa's team left for Mumbai and that the smugglers, in fact, postponed the landing as they heard from sources that an ambush had been laid for them by Thapa. These accusations stand to be the same even when contradicting others. Journalist S. Bhatt summarized the confessions thusly: \"[they] bribed all Customs officers except for Thapa, who incidentally is an accused in the case.\" In the 10,000-page judgement, TADA Court Judge P.D. Kode reasoned that even without evidence against Thapa, he received a life sentence because he was the senior-most customs officer and thus must be aware of the conspiracy. Thapa proclaimed his innocence and was confident that the greater conspiracy of his wrongful arrest, trial and conviction would be unveiled in the Supreme Court which, in 1994, granted him bail on lack of evidence. Thapa died due to lung cancer on 11 April 2008. His family expressed hopes that the supreme court would hear their plea for the truth.\n* R K Singh, a former assistant commissioner of customs, was convicted for facilitating the RDX landing in Shekhadi after accepting a bribe of more than 7.8\u00a0lakh ( 780,000).

{"title":"Tarata bombing","article":"The Tarata bombing was a terrorist attack in Lima, Peru, on July 16, 1992, by the Shining Path terrorist group. The blast was the deadliest Shining Path bombing during the Internal conflict in Peru and was part of a larger bombing campaign in the city.\n\nThe explosions happened on Avenida Larco, in the business area of Miraflores, an upscale district of the city. Two trucks, each packed with 1,000\u00a0kg of explosives, exploded on the street at 9:15 pm outside the Bank \u201cBanco de Cr\u00e9dito\u201d of Peru, killing 25 and wounding 155. The blast destroyed or damaged 183 homes, 400 businesses and 63 parked cars. The bombings were the beginning of a week-long Shining Path strike against the Peruvian government, a strike which caused 40 deaths and shut down much of the capital.\n\nIn the wake of the incident, galvanized by public outrage, President Alberto Fujimori intensified his crackdown on Peruvian insurgent groups.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1992, Peru was in the midst of terrorists groups, the most radical and active of which was Shining Path, a militant offshoot of the Peruvian Communist Party. That year, a coup led by President Alberto Fujimori on April 5, in which he dissolved Congress as part of a broader political crackdown, aggravated the domestic social conflict.\n\nEarlier Shining Path attacks that year included the February 15 murder of Mar\u00eda Elena Moyano, a community organizer in Villa El Salvador Ward, who was shot at close range then blown up with dynamite.  Also, on June 5 a car bomb exploded beside the Frecuencia Latina television station near midnight, killing journalist Alejandro Perez one of the survivors was Magali Veran.\n\n== The attack ==\nThe attack took place on Thursday July 16 and targeted the Credit Bank of Peru located on Avenida Larco. During the day, Shining Path forces in Lima conducted attacks against police stations and smaller financial institutions in order to disperse the police and clear the way for the main attack. Near the planned time, there was a wavering in electric power followed by one of the blackouts common in the city at that time. \n\nAccording to testimony of Shining Path militants interviewed by the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the twelfth Shining Path detachment in Lima, commanded by \"Comrade Daniel\" (later identified as Carlos Mora La Madrid in the Commission's records), was responsible for conducting the attack.\n\nThe original plan was to set off explosives in front of that bank at 9:20 pm, but the establishment did not allow them to park in the place agreed. They therefore decided to leave their vehicle at the next intersection (which was Tarata Street) and allow it to drift forward until it exploded.  Once in the street, the driver slowed down and abandoned the truck.\n\nThe explosive payload was 400\u2014500 kilograms of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil mixed with dynamite. The buildings most affected by their locations near the center of the blast were El Condado, San Pedro, Tarata, Central Residential and San Carlos. The shock wave extended for 300 meters. The explosion killed 25, wounded 155, and caused more than US$3 million in damage.\n\n== Impact ==\nResponse from around the world denounced the Shining Path and expressed support with the Peruvian government and people in overcoming the situation. \n\nAccording to specialists, it was the first time in the course of the civil war that \"traditional\" Lima society experienced the conflict. It was the first time that a terrorist act was carried out against a large-scale civilian target and the first direct attack on a city center.\n\nThe attack also led to self-examinations within the Shining Path, whose main leaders recognized the act as a \"mistake\" that should not have happened because it did not advance the group's main objective.\n\nThis attack was used as a justification for the La Cantuta massacre two days later on July 18, in which nine students and one teacher at the National University of Education Enrique Guzm\u00e1n y Valle, Shining Path suspects, were kidnapped and disappeared during the night by members of the Grupo Colina death squad. All were accused of having perpetrated the Tarata bombing.\n\nShining Path leader Abimael Guzm\u00e1n was arrested in September 1992 and sentenced to life imprisonment. In 2014 he and his wife Elena Iparraguirre were tried for having ordered the Tarata bombing.\n\n==References==\n\n\n*","urls":["https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-latin-america-17188842","http:\/\/fas.org\/irp\/world\/para\/docs\/sf2.htm","http:\/\/economistsview.typepad.com\/economistsview\/2006\/04\/history_of_the__1.html","http:\/\/www.micromuseo.org.pe\/rutas\/habanamemoriadelolvido\/atentado.html","http:\/\/cpj.org\/killed\/1992\/alejandro-perez.php","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20070611125152\/http:\/\/www.bcasas.org.pe\/prensa\/2006\/07\/16\/tarata-a-14-anos-del-terror\/","http:\/\/archivodepaisbizarro.blogspot.com\/2005\/10\/el-loco-ms-peligroso-de-amrica.html","http:\/\/www.caretas.com.pe\/2001\/1679\/articulos\/garrido.phtml","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2014\/jan\/21\/shining-path-leader-presidente-gonzalo-abimael-guzman"]}

The target of the bombing was the Barclay's Bank in the town. The perpetrators were never identified or convicted.

{"title":"Plaza Rep\u00fablica Dominicana bombing","article":"The Plaza Rep\u00fablica Dominicana bombing was an attack carried out by the armed Basque  separatist group ETA in Madrid, Spain on 14 July 1986, which killed 12 people and injured a further 32. The dead were all members of the Guardia Civil studying in the nearby traffic school on Pr\u00edncipe de Vergara. The ETA members later convicted of participation in the attack included significant figures in the group such as Antonio Troiti\u00f1o and I\u00f1aki de Juana Chaos.\n\n==Background==\nThe \"comando Espa\u00f1a\" of ETA had been responsible for 20 deaths in the previous year, these included an attack in Madrid three months earlier, which had resulted in five deaths, and an attack the previous month which had killed three people. ETA as a whole had been responsible for 24 deaths in 1986 prior to the attack, 18 of those had occurred in Madrid, leading to claims that the organisation was focusing on the Spanish capital because it believed that attacks there had greater influence on public opinion than attacks in the Basque region. The attack had the highest number of casualties since the El Descanso bombing, by suspected Islamic Jihadists in April 1985, had killed 18 people.\n\n==Targets==\nThe police convoy consisted of 70 civil guards, aged between 18 and 25, who had left a traffic school in order to head to Venta de la Rubia, on the outskirts of the Spanish capital, where police engaged in daily practice driving a motorcycle. The convoy consisted of a bus, a minibus and a Land Rover and followed the same route at the same time every day, making it easier for ETA to target it.\n\n==The attack==\nThe car bomb was loaded with 35 kilos of Goma-2 explosives and significant quantities of shrapnel and was triggered by remote control by Antonio Troiti\u00f1o, who had been waiting for the passing of the convoy at a nearby bus stop. One of ETA's most active members, Jose Ignacio de Juana Chaos, was waiting nearby in a vehicle to flee. The explosion threw the bus into the air. Four officers were killed instantly and 32 others were injured, including six civilians. A further four officers were pronounced dead shortly afterward at the nearby La Paz clinic, with a ninth dead announced at 21:30 the same day. Those injured included commuters waiting at a nearby bus stop, while cars and property in the Plaza were also damaged.\n\n==Reactions==\nThe Plaza Rep\u00fablica Dominicana attack occurred three weeks after the Spanish General Election and one day before the newly elected parliament opened. There was also speculation that the attack was in response to the French government's decision the previous day to extradite Jos\u00e9 Iturbe, the alleged military leader of ETA, from Gabon to face trial, though this theory was challenged by the Spanish deputy Prime Minister Alfonso Guerra, who pointed out that such an attack would have required a longer period of planning.\n\nMayor of Madrid, Juan Barranco, called for solidarity with the victims and their families and requested a three-minute silence at midday the same day.\n\n==Arrests==\nAnt\u00f3n Troiti\u00f1o, alias 'Miguel \u00c1ngel' and Jos\u00e9 Ignacio de Juana Chaos were finally apprehended on 16 January 1987, when anti-terrorist police mounted an operation against their base of operations, a flat on R\u00edo Ulla Street in Madrid. Four other ETA members: Cristina Arrizabalaga, Mar\u00eda Teresa Rojo, Esteban Esteban Nieto, In\u00e9s del R\u00edo Prada and Inmaculada Noble where arrested in the same operation. In 1989, Troiti\u00f1o was convicted of 22 murders and sentenced to 2,232 years in prison However he was released from prison on 13 April 2011. In\u00e9s del R\u00edo Prada received sentences totalling 3,828 years for her participation in this and other attacks. These sentences were to run concurrently, making her eligible for release in 2008. However the new government of Mariano Rajoy changed the laws, making ETA prisoners ineligible for early release on good behaviour grounds. As a result, del R\u00edo Prada became ineligible for release until 2017. She challenged this at the European Court of Human Rights and won her case, resulting in her release on 22 October 2013.\n\n==References==","urls":["http:\/\/www.eldiariomontanes.es\/rc\/20110714\/mas-actualidad\/nacional\/anos-atentado-201107141407.html","http:\/\/hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com\/preview\/1986\/07\/15\/pagina-4\/32884532\/pdf.html","http:\/\/www.elmundo.es\/suplementos\/cronica\/2006\/556\/1151186418.html","http:\/\/hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com\/preview\/1986\/07\/15\/pagina-3\/32884531\/pdf.html","http:\/\/hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com\/preview\/1986\/07\/15\/pagina-1\/32884529\/pdf.html","http:\/\/www.elmundo.es\/elmundo\/2011\/04\/13\/espana\/1302713210.html","http:\/\/elpais.com\/diario\/2011\/04\/14\/espana\/1302732001_850215.html","https:\/\/www.economist.com\/news\/europe\/21588434-european-court-orders-release-eta-terrorists-prison-assassin-walks-free"]}

{"title":"Harrods bombing","article":"The Harrods bombing refers to the car bomb that exploded outside Harrods department store in central London on Saturday 17 December 1983. Members of the Provisional IRA planted the time bomb and sent a warning 37 minutes before it exploded, but the area was not evacuated. The blast killed three police officers and three civilians, injured 90 people, and caused much damage. The IRA Army Council claimed it had not authorised the attack and expressed regret for the civilian casualties. After the bombing, the IRA shifted its emphasis towards attacks on military targets on the mainland.\n\nHarrods had been the target of other IRA bombings. On the 18 August 1973 two fire bombs exploded causing slight damage; again on 21 December 1974 another fire bomb was placed in the north-east corner of the first floor. There was a very short warning and the store was in the process of being cleared when it exploded. The 1974 bomb was the work of the infamous Balcombe Street Gang who also carried out high-profile bombings in Knightsbridge, Piccadilly, Oxford Street, Woolwich, and many other locations in London and Surrey. It was also the target of a much smaller IRA bomb almost ten years later, in January 1993, which injured four people (see 1993 Harrods bombing).\n\n==Bombing overview==\nFrom 1973 the Provisional IRA had carried out waves of bombing attacks on commercial targets in London and elsewhere in England as part of its \"economic war\". The goal was to damage the economy and cause disruption, which would put pressure on the British government to withdraw from Northern Ireland. Harrods\u2014a large, upmarket department store in the affluent Knightsbridge district, near Buckingham Palace\u2014had been targeted before by the IRA. On 10 December 1983, the IRA carried out its first attack in London for some time when a bomb exploded at the Royal Artillery Barracks, injuring three British soldiers.\n\nOne week later, on the afternoon of 17 December, IRA members parked a car bomb near the side entrance of Harrods, on Hans Crescent. The bomb contained 25 to  of explosives and was set to be detonated by a timer. It was left in a 1972 blue Austin 1300 GT four-door saloon car. At 12:44 a man using an IRA codeword phoned the central London branch of the Samaritans charity. The caller said there was a car bomb outside Harrods and another bomb inside Harrods, and gave the car's registration plate. According to police, he did not give any other description of the car.\n\nThe bomb exploded at about 13:21, as four police officers in a car, an officer on foot and a police dog-handler neared the suspect vehicle. Six people were killed (three officers and three bystanders) and 90 others were injured, including 14 police officers. The blast damaged 24 cars and all five floors on the side of Harrods, sending a shower of glass down on the street. The police car absorbed much of the blast and this likely prevented further casualties.\n\nFive people died at the scene of the bombing and a sixth later died in hospital. The bystanders who died were Philip Geddes (24), a journalist who had heard about the alert and went to the scene; Jasmine Cochrane-Patrick (25); and Kenneth Salvesen (28), a US citizen. The Metropolitan Police officers killed were Sergeant Noel Lane (28) and Constable Jane Arbuthnot (22). A third officer, Inspector Stephen Dodd (34), died in hospital from his injuries on 24 December. Constable Jon Gordon survived, but lost both legs and part of a hand in the blast.\n\nAt the time of the explosion, a second warning call was made by the IRA. The caller said that a bomb had been left in the C&A department store at the east end of Oxford Street. Police cleared the area and cordoned it off but this claim was found to be false. In the aftermath of the attack, hundreds of extra police and mobile bomb squads were drafted into London. Aleck Craddock, chairman of Harrods, reported that \u00a31 million in turnover had been lost as a result of the bombing. Despite the damage, Harrods re-opened three days later, proclaiming it would not be \"defeated by acts of terrorism\". Denis Thatcher, the husband of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, visited the store and told reporters \"no damned Irishman is going to stop me going there\".\n\n===IRA response===\nThe bombing badly damaged the IRA's support due to the civilian deaths and injuries. In a statement issued the day after, the IRA Army Council admitted that IRA members had planted the bomb, but claimed that it had not authorised the attack:The Harrods operation was not authorised by the Irish Republican Army. We have taken immediate steps to ensure that there will be no repetition of this type of operation again. The volunteers involved gave a 40 minutes specific warning, which should have been adequate. But due to the inefficiency or failure of the Metropolitan Police, who boasted of foreknowledge of IRA activity, this warning did not result in an evacuation. We regret the civilian casualties, even though our expression of sympathy will be dismissed. Finally, we remind the British Government that as long as they maintain control of any part of Ireland then the Irish Republican Army will continue to operate in Britain.\n\nLeon Brittan, the Home Secretary, commented: \"The nature of a terrorist organisation is that those in it are not under disciplined control\". In his book The Provisional IRA in England, author Gary McGladdery says the bombing illustrated one of the problems with the IRA's cell system, where units \"could become virtually autonomous from the rest of the organisation and operate at their own discretion\". The IRA had adopted the system in the late 1970s.\n\n===Memorials===\nThere is a memorial at the site of the blast. Yearly prizes in honour of Philip Geddes are awarded to aspiring journalists attending the University of Oxford. As a further commemoration, every year the Philip Geddes Memorial Lecture on the theme of the future of journalism is given by a leading journalist.\n\n==See also==\n*List of British police officers killed in the line of duty\n*Provisional Irish Republican Army campaign 1969\u20131997\n*1973 Old Bailey bombing\n*Oxford Street bombing\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n*  Witness accounts of the event on the BBC","urls":["https:\/\/api.parliament.uk\/historic-hansard\/written-answers\/1975\/nov\/11\/bombings<\/ref>","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1983\/12\/11\/world\/around-the-world-4-soldiers-wounded-by-bombing-in-london.html","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/fromthearchive\/story\/0,,1376054,00.html","http:\/\/www.margaretthatcher.org\/archive\/displaydocument.asp?docid=109280","http:\/\/cain.ulst.ac.uk\/sutton\/chron\/1983.html","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/onthisday\/hi\/dates\/stories\/december\/17\/newsid_2538000\/2538147.stm","https:\/\/news.google.com\/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19831221&id=-T0lAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jaUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1079,37495","http:\/\/www.citythemes.co.uk\/pdffiles\/police.pdf","http:\/\/www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk\/training\/021126ox.shtml","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20061208065546\/http:\/\/www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk\/training\/021126ox.shtml","http:\/\/www.ox.ac.uk\/gazette\/2004-5\/supps\/schols\/geddes.htm","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20050312072145\/http:\/\/www.ox.ac.uk\/gazette\/2004-5\/supps\/schols\/geddes.htm"]}
{"title":"1983 Kuwait bombings","article":"The 1983 Kuwait bombings were attacks on six key foreign and Kuwaiti installations on 12 December 1983, two months after the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing. The 90-minute coordinated attack on two embassies, the country's main airport, and petro-chemical plant was more notable for the damage it was intended to cause than what was actually destroyed. What might have been \"the worst terrorist episode of the twentieth century in the Middle East\" killed only six people because of the bombs' faulty rigging.\n\nThe perpetrators of the bombing are unknown but were purported to be connected to the Islamic Republic of Iran. The motivation of the bombing is suspected to have been punishment against Kuwait, the United States and France for their military and financial assistance to Iraq in the Iran\u2013Iraq War.\n\n==Bombings==\nOn 12 December 1983, a truck laden with 45 large cylinders of gas connected to plastic explosives broke through the front gates of the American Embassy in Kuwait City and rammed into the embassy's three-story administrative annex, demolishing half the structure. The shock blew out windows and doors in distant homes and shops.\n\nOnly five people were killed (two Palestinians, two Kuwaitis, and one Syrian) in large part because the driver did not hit the more heavily populated chancellery building and more importantly, only a quarter of the explosives ignited. An American diplomat told journalist Robin Wright: \"If everything had gone off, this place would have been a parking lot\".\n\nFive other explosions were attempted within an hour. An hour later, a car parked outside the French embassy blew up, leaving a massive 30\u00a0ft hole in the embassy security wall. No one was killed, and only five people were wounded.\n\nThe target intended to get the most powerful explosion was Kuwait's main oil refinery and water desalination plant, the Shuaiba Petrochemical Plant. 150 gas cylinders on a truck carrying 200 cylinders exploded 150 meters from the No. 2 refinery and only a few meters from a highly flammable heap of sulfa-based chemicals. Had that bombing been successful, it would have crippled the oil production of one of the world's major oil exporters and shut down most of the water supply of the nation.\n\nOther car bombs exploded at the control tower at the Kuwait International Airport, the Electricity Control Center, and the living quarters for American employees of the Raytheon Corporation, which was installing a missile system in Kuwait. Two bombs at Raytheon went off, the first intended to bring the residents outside and the second intended to kill. The attempt failed as the residents did not emerge. An Egyptian technician was killed in the control tower bombing, but none of the other bombings resulted in fatalities.\n\nThe bombing of the American embassy was an early instance of suicide bombing in the Middle East, along with the Hezbollah's bombing of the American Embassy and the bombing of the Marine barracks in Lebanon earlier that year in which Hezbollah is suspected to be the orchestrator.\n\n==Responsibility==\nIslamic Jihad Organization and Islamic Dawa Party were reported at the time to be involved in the bombing. Shortly after the blasts, Islamic Jihad called Kuwaiti authorities to take responsibility for the blast. The claim was taken seriously after the callers' boast that there was a \"seventh bomb\" was verified by the discovery of a car bomb in front of the Immigration Bureau.\n\nIslamic Dawa was connected to the bombing when the remains of a human thumb were found and its thumbprint identified as that of Raad Murtin Ajeel, a 25-year-old Iraqi Shia member of Dawa. Ultimately, 21 other defendants were put on trial (17 captured in a nationwide manhunt and 4 tried in absentia). After a six-week trial, six were sentenced to death (three of those were in absentia), seven to life imprisonment, seven to terms between five and fifteen years. One of those convicted by a court in Kuwait in February 2007 was Jamal Jafaar Mohammed, more commonly known by his nom de guerre as Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who was a member of Kata'ib Hezbollah and Iraq's parliament and military commander of the Popular Mobilization Forces.\n\n==Motivation==\nSome analysts claim the bombings were the work of Iran in cooperation with Shia allies from Iraq and Lebanon. Kuwait had given considerable support to Iraq in the 1980-1988 Iran\u2013Iraq War. Between 1983 and 1984, Kuwait provided $7 billion in financial assistance and was second to Saudi Arabia in aiding Iraq, Massive destruction and loss of life in Kuwait would also have provided an example to the other oil-rich, population-poor, Arab monarchies of the Persian Gulf, also helping Iraq against its larger, non-Arab, anti-monarchist revolutionary Islamic neighbor. In 1985, the Arab States of the Persian Gulf provided Iraq with financial contributions, totaling in the range of $40 to 50 billion.\n\nAmericans and the French are thought to have been targets in Kuwait because of their assistance to Iraq and lack of help to Iran. America had halted all shipments of arms to Iran, and extended $2 billion in trade credit to Iraq in \"Operation Staunch\" in 1983.\n\n==Response==\nThe blasts were said to have taken the Kuwaiti government \"completely by surprise\" and left it dumbfounded, terrified and shaken to their core that such a well-organized terrorist operation could have taken place under their noses. According to the Monday Morning gazette, the hitherto relaxed nation was transformed into a \"police state,\" with roundups of foreign workers, numerous roadblocks, identity checks, and guardsmen under orders to \"shoot whoever refused to stop or be searched.\"\n\n==Pressure on Kuwait to free the bombers==\nOf the \"Kuwait 17\", 12 were Iraqis in al-Dawa, and 3 were Lebanese. One was Mustafa Badr Al Din, who was sentenced to death. He was also a cousin and brother-in-law of one of Hezbollah's senior officers, Imad Mugniyah.\n\"Analysts say,... there is little doubt Mugniyeh and Al Din helped plan December 1983 bombings in Kuwait against the U.S. and French embassies there....\"\n\nBoth the organization of Hezbollah and the Islamic Republic of Iran and the location of Dawa's headquarters helped free their fellow Shia revolutionaries in Kuwait.\n\nIn Lebanon, Western hostages, including American Frank Regier and Frenchman Christian Joubert, were held by Shia radicals demanding the release of the al-Dawa terrorists as the price of the hostages' release. On 27 March 1984, following the conviction of the al-Da'wa defendants, the hostage takers threatened to kill their hostages if the Kuwaiti government carried through with the planned execution of the al-Dawa prisoners. A month later, American Benjamin Weir was kidnapped by actors demanding the same. Anglican hostage negotiator Terry Waite appealed to the Emir of Kuwait and tried to obtain a visa to come to Kuwait. His failure to make progress in freeing the convicted terrorists is thought to be the reason that he himself was kidnapped and spent five years as a hostage.\n\nAlthough those sentenced to death were to be hanged within 30 days, the Emir of Kuwait did not sign their death sentence. The executions were delayed for years until the men escaped.\n\n===Iran===\nChief Kuwaiti government spokesman Abdel Aziz Hussein called the bombings \"the first concentrated Iranian operation to export the revolution and destabilize the Persian Gulf after Iran failed to infiltrate the Iraqi [war] front.\" Kuwait was threatened with further attacks if the defendants were not released, with Tehran Radio regularly broadcasting warnings from Dawa that Kuwait would face \"serious consequences\" if the \"heroes\" standing trial were harmed.\n\n===Hezbollah===\nOver the next several years, Hezbollah perpetrated a string of kidnappings and bombings with the goal of forcing the Kuwaiti government to free the al-Dawa prisoners. Hostage Terry Anderson was told that he and the other hostages kidnapped in Beirut had been abducted \"to gain the freedom of their seventeen comrades in Kuwait.\"\n\nThe Kuwait 17 then played a role in the Iran-Contra scandal: the principals of Iran-Contra offered to sway Kuwait to release the Kuwait 17 as one of several incentives to free American hostages in Lebanon. However, when U.S. President Ronald Reagan learned of this offer, he allegedly responded \"like he had been kicked in the belly.\"\n\n==Aircraft hijackings (1984\u20131988)==\n===Kuwait Airways Flight 221===\nOn 3 December 1984, a Kuwait Airways flight from Kuwait City to Karachi, Pakistan was hijacked by four Lebanese Shi'a hijackers and diverted to Tehran. The hijackers demand was the release of the Kuwait 17, which was not met. During the course of the standoff women, children and Muslims were released and two American officials from the US Agency for International Development, Charles Hegna and William Stanford, were shot dead and dumped on the tarmac. The few dozen passengers left on board, particularly Americans were threatened and tortured. \"Every five minutes there was a frightening incident. There was no letup at all,\" British flight engineer Neil Beeston told the BBC. Paradoxically, the hijackers released a statement, claiming, \"We do not have any enmity toward anyone and we do not intend to deny the freedom of anyone or to frighten anyone....\" On the sixth day of the drama, Iranian security forces stormed the plane and released the remaining hostages. Authorities said they would be brought to trial, but the hijackers were released and allowed to leave the country. Some passengers and officials suggested complicity by Iran in the hijacking and that the hostage rescue had been staged. One Kuwaiti and two Pakistani passengers claimed that the hijackers received additional weapons and equipment once the plane had landed, including handcuffs and nylon ropes used to tie passengers to their seats. One American official wondered if the surrender was not preplanned: \"You do not invite cleaners aboard an airplane after you have planted explosives, promised to blow up the plane, and read your last will and testament.\"\n\nThe US State Department announced a $250,000 reward for information leading to the arrests of those involved in the hijacking but made no military response. Later press reports linked Hezbollah's Imad Mughniyah to the hijackings.\n\n===TWA Flight 847===\nOn 14 June 1985, TWA Flight 847 was hijacked en route from Athens to Rome. One of the demands of the hijackers was the release of the 17 prisoners held in Kuwait.\n\n===Kuwait Airways Flight 422===\nOn 5 April 1988, Kuwait Airways Flight 422 was hijacked from Bangkok to Kuwait with 111 passengers and crew aboard, including three members of the Kuwaiti Royal Family. Six or seven Lebanese men (including Hassan Izz-Al-Din, a veteran of the TWA 847 hijacking) armed with guns and hand grenades forced the pilot to land in Mashhad, Iran, and demanded the release of 17 Shiite Muslims guerrillas held in Kuwait. Lasting 16 days and traveling 3,200\u00a0mi from Mashhad in northeastern Iran to Larnaca, Cyprus, and finally to Algiers, it is the longest skyjacking to date. Two passengers, Abdullah Khalidi, 25, and Khalid Ayoub Bandar, 20, both Kuwaitis, were shot dead by the hijackers and dumped on the tarmac in Cyprus. Kuwait did not release the 17 prisoners, and the hijackers were allowed to leave Algiers.\n\n==1985 attempted assassination of Jaber==\nBy May 1985, Islamic Jihad had accumulated six hostages in Lebanon, four Americans and two French, and on 16 May, it released photos of them promising a \"horrible disaster\" if the jailed terrorists in Kuwait were not released. On 25 May 1985, a suicide car bomber attacked the motorcade of Kuwaiti ruler Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, killing two bodyguards and a passerby, wounding Jaber. Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility and again demanded the terrorists release.\n\n==Aftermath==\nEventually, the \"Kuwait 17\" prisoners gained freedom, reportedly during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, when 1,300 prisoners escaped from Kuwait's Saidia central prison. The 15 al-Da'wa prisoners were taken into custody and \"released to Iran\" by Iraqi officials.\n\nAl-Dawa has insisted that the attacks in Kuwait were perpetrated by agents \"hijacked\" by Iran. In February 2007, journalists reported that Jamal Jaafar Muhammad, who was elected to the Iraqi parliament in 2005 as part of the SCIRI\/Badr faction of the United Iraqi Alliance (UIA), was also sentenced to death in Kuwait for planning the al-Dawa bombings.\n\n==See also==\n*1981 Bahraini coup d'\u00e9tat attempt\n* Hezbollah\n* Lebanon hostage crisis\n* List of terrorist organisations\n\n==References==\n\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Jaber, Hala.

{"title":"Tyre headquarters bombings","article":"The Tyre headquarters bombings were two suicide bombings against the Israel Defense Forces' headquarters building in Tyre, Lebanon, in 1982 and 1983. The blasts killed 103 Israelis and 46\u201359 Lebanese, wounding 95 people and were some of the worst losses ever for the IDF. Israel believes both to be the responsibility of Hezbollah.\n\n==First bombing==\nAfter invading Lebanon in June, the Israeli military set up command posts to run the cities they occupied. On November 11, 1982, a Peugeot car packed with explosives struck the seven-story building being used by the Israeli military to govern Tyre. The explosion leveled the building and killed 75 Israeli soldiers, border policemen, and Shin Bet agents. In addition, anywhere from 14\u201327 Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners that were being held by Israel were killed. Twenty-seven Israelis and 28 Arabs were injured.\n\nThe Israeli government said soon after the blast, and insists to this day, that the explosion was an accident resulting from gas cylinders exploding.

{"title":"Tyre headquarters bombings","article":"The Tyre headquarters bombings were two suicide bombings against the Israel Defense Forces' headquarters building in Tyre, Lebanon, in 1982 and 1983. The blasts killed 103 Israelis and 46\u201359 Lebanese, wounding 95 people and were some of the worst losses ever for the IDF. Israel believes both to be the responsibility of Hezbollah.\n\n==First bombing==\nAfter invading Lebanon in June, the Israeli military set up command posts to run the cities they occupied. On November 11, 1982, a Peugeot car packed with explosives struck the seven-story building being used by the Israeli military to govern Tyre. The explosion leveled the building and killed 75 Israeli soldiers, border policemen, and Shin Bet agents. In addition, anywhere from 14\u201327 Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners that were being held by Israel were killed. Twenty-seven Israelis and 28 Arabs were injured.\n\nThe Israeli government said soon after the blast, and insists to this day, that the explosion was an accident resulting from gas cylinders exploding. This is contrary to the three witnesses who saw the Peugeot speed to the building, the identification of the car's parts in the rubble of the building, and the existence of a Shin Bet report detailing the Hezbollah preparations for the bombing.\n\nThere is a monument near Baalbek, Lebanon, dedicated to 17-year-old Ahmad Qassir, the suicide bomber responsible for the attack.\n\n==Second bombing==\nAlmost a year later, a nearly identical bombing happened in Tyre.

{"title":"Hyde Park and Regent's Park bombings","article":"The Hyde Park and Regent's Park bombings were carried out on 20 July 1982 in London, England. Members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) detonated two bombs during British military ceremonies in Hyde Park and Regent's Park, both in central London.\n\nThe explosions killed 11 military personnel: four soldiers of the Blues & Royals at Hyde Park, and seven bandsmen of the Royal Green Jackets at Regent's Park. Seven of the Blues & Royals' horses also died in the attack. One seriously injured horse, Sefton, survived and was subsequently featured on television programmes and was awarded \"Horse of the Year\".\n\nIn 1987, Gilbert \"Danny\" McNamee was convicted of making the Hyde Park bomb and jailed for 25 years. He served 12 years before being released under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement; his conviction was later quashed. In 2013, John Downey was charged with four counts of murder in relation to the Hyde Park attack; his trial began in January 2014 but collapsed the following month after a ruling upon a letter sent to him by police assuring him that he would not be prosecuted over the attack. On 18 December 2019 the High Court ruled, in a civil case, that John Downey was an \"active participant\" in the bombing.\n\nNo one has ever been charged in connection with the Regent's Park bombing.\n\n==The attacks==\n===Hyde Park bomb===\n\n\nAt 10:40 am, a nail bomb exploded in the boot of a blue Morris Marina parked on South Carriage Drive in Hyde Park. The bomb comprised  of gelignite and  of nails. It exploded as soldiers of the Household Cavalry, Queen Elizabeth II's official bodyguard regiment, were passing. They were taking part in their daily Changing of the Guard procession from their barracks in Knightsbridge to Horse Guards Parade. Three soldiers of the Blues & Royals were killed outright, and another, their standard-bearer, died from his wounds three days later. The other soldiers in the procession were badly wounded, and a number of civilians were injured. Seven of the regiment's horses were also killed or had to be euthanised because of their injuries. Explosives experts believed that the Hyde Park bomb was triggered by remote by an IRA member inside the park.\n\n===Regent's Park bomb===\nThe second attack happened at about 12:55 pm, when a bomb exploded underneath a bandstand in Regent's Park. Thirty Military bandsmen of the Royal Green Jackets were on the stand performing music from Oliver! to a crowd of 120 people.\n\nIt was the first in a series of advertised lunchtime concerts there. Six of the bandsmen were killed outright and the rest were wounded; a seventh died of his wounds on 1 August. At least eight civilians were also injured. The bomb had been hidden under the stand some time before and triggered by a timer. Unlike the Hyde Park bomb, it contained no nails and seemed to be designed to cause minimal harm to bystanders.\n\n===Fatalities===\n*WO2 Graham Barker, 1st Battalion The Royal Green Jackets\n*Corporal Major Roy Bright, The Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons)\n*Lieutenant Anthony Daly, The Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons)\n*Bandsman John Heritage, 1st Battalion The Royal Green Jackets\n*Corporal Robert Livingstone, 1st Battalion The Royal Green Jackets\n*Corporal Robert McKnight, 1st Battalion The Royal Green Jackets\n*Bandsman George Mesure, 1st Battalion The Royal Green Jackets\n*Bandsman Keith Powell, 1st Battalion The Royal Green Jackets\n*Bandsman Laurence Smith, 1st Battalion The Royal Green Jackets\n*Trooper Simon Tipper, The Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons)\n*Lance Corporal Jeffrey Vernon Young, The Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons)\n\n====Horses====\nThe seven horses of the Blues and Royals that were killed were Cedric, Epaulette, Falcon, Rochester, Waterford, Yeastvite and Zara.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAt least 51 people were injured, and a total of 22 people were admitted to hospital as a result of the blasts: 18 soldiers, a police officer, and three civilians. The IRA claimed responsibility for the attacks by deliberately mirroring Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's words a few months before when Britain entered the Falklands War. They proclaimed that: \"The Irish people have sovereign and national rights which no task or occupational force can put down\". Reacting to the bombing, Thatcher stated: \"These callous and cowardly crimes have been committed by evil, brutal men who know nothing of democracy. We shall not rest until they are brought to justice.\n\nThe bombings weakened public support in the United States for the Irish republican cause.\n\nSefton, a horse that survived the attack at Hyde Park despite suffering serious wounds, became famous after appearing in many television shows and was awarded Horse of the Year. Sefton's rider at the time of the bombing, Michael Pedersen, survived but believed he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder; after splitting from his wife he committed suicide in September 2012 after killing two of his children.\n\nA memorial marks the spot of the Hyde Park bombing; and the troop honours it daily with an eyes-left and salute with drawn swords. A plaque commemorating the victims of the second attack stands in Regent's Park.\n\n==Criminal proceedings==\n\nIn October 1987, 27-year-old Gilbert \"Danny\" McNamee, from County Armagh, was sentenced at the Old Bailey to 25 years in prison for his role in the Hyde Park bombing and others. In December 1998, shortly after his release from Maze prison under the Good Friday Agreement, three Court of Appeal judges quashed his conviction, deeming it \"unsafe\" because of withheld fingerprint evidence that implicated other bomb-makers. They stated that though the conviction was unsafe it did not mean McNamee was necessarily innocent of the charge.\n\nOn 19 May 2013, 61-year-old John Anthony Downey, from County Donegal, was charged with murder in relation to the Hyde Park bomb and intending to cause an explosion likely to endanger life. He appeared by videolink from Belmarsh prison for a bail hearing at the Old Bailey on 24 May and did not apply for bail so was remanded in custody. At a hearing on 1 August 2013, Downey was granted conditional bail and a trial was scheduled for January 2014.\n\nOn 24 January 2014, Downey appeared at the Old Bailey for the beginning of his trial; he entered a not guilty plea on the four murder charges and the charge of intending to cause an explosion. On 25 February 2014, it was revealed that Downey's trial had collapsed after the presiding judge had ruled, on 21 February, upon a letter sent by the Police Service of Northern Ireland to Downey in 2007, assuring him that he would not face criminal charges over the attack. Although the assurance was made in error and the police realised the mistake, it was never withdrawn, and the judge ruled that therefore the defendant had been misled and prosecuting him would be an abuse of executive power. Downey is one of 187 IRA suspects who received secret on-the-run letters guaranteeing them unofficial immunity from prosecution. In December 2019 the High Court ruled in a civil action against Downey  by the family of a victim that he had been an \"active participant\" in the Hyde Park bombing, subject to a claim for damages.\n\n== References ==","urls":["https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-northern-ireland-50835044]<\/ref>","https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Horse-Guards-General-Barney-White-Spunner\/dp\/140505574X","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/onthisday\/hi\/dates\/stories\/july\/20\/newsid_2515000\/2515343.stm","http:\/\/www.householdcavalrymuseum.co.uk\/in-memoriam-july-20th-1982\/","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/uk-news\/2017\/jul\/21\/ira-bombs-london-parks-kill-eight-soldiers-1982","https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1982\/07\/21\/world\/ira-bomb-attacks-in-london-kill-8.html","http:\/\/www.horseshowcentral.com\/flex\/sefton_battle_of_a_war_horse\/269\/1","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20091006045419\/http:\/\/www.horseshowcentral.com\/flex\/sefton_battle_of_a_war_horse\/269\/1","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-hampshire-20615831","https:\/\/www.londonremembers.com\/memorials\/hyde-park-bomb\/","https:\/\/www.royalparks.org.uk\/parks\/the-regents-park\/things-to-see-and-do\/memorials,-fountains-and-statues","http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/uk\/236898.stm","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-22625104","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-23533548","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-25886041","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-26342465","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-northern-ireland-26352967","https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-northern-ireland-50835044"]}
