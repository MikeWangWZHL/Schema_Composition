    "article": "The Kiryat Menachem bus bombing was a suicide bombing which occurred on November 21, 2002 in a public bus in the neighborhood of Kiryat Menachem in  Jerusalem, Israel. 11 people were killed in the attack and over 50 were injured.\n\nThe Palestinian Islamist militant organization Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\n== The attack ==\nOn November 21, 2002, at around 7:00 am,  Palestinian suicide bomber Na'el Abu Hilail, wearing an explosives belt packed with five-kilograms of explosives and shrapnel, boarded the public bus on Mexico Street in Jerusalem.\n\nThe suicide bomber detonated the explosives in the crowded bus, before the bus reached the next stop, while the bus was in the suburban neighborhood of Kiryat Menachem. 11 people were killed in the attack and over 50 were injured.\n\n=== Fatalities ===\n\n\n== The perpetrators==\nHamas took credit for the attack, which was carried out by Na'el Abu Hilail, 22, from el-Khader, just south of Bethlehem. Four of the victims were children on their way to school. Abu Hilail's father said he was pleased with his son, saying \"Our religion says we are proud of him until the day of resurrection.\" His friends said he was a supporter of Islamic Jihad.\n\n==See also==\n*Civilian casualties in the Second Intifada\n*Israeli casualties of war\n\n==References==\n\n\n== External links ==\n*  Bomb in Crowded Commuter Bus in Jerusalem Kills at Least 10 \u2013 The Washington Post, November 21, 2002\n*  Jerusalem suicide bombing kills 11 \u2013 The Guardian, November 21, 2002\n*  4 Children Are Among Dead In Jerusalem Bus Bombing \u2013 published on the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, November 22, 2002\n*  Jerusalem bus blast kills 11 \u2013 published on BBC News, November 21, 2002\n*  Suicide bomber kills 11 in Jerusalem \u2013 published on The Sun, November 22, 2002\n*  Bus Bomb Attack Kills 11 / Jerusalem blast injures 50; Sharon considering retaliation \u2013 published on Newsday, November 22, 2002\n*  Suicide bombing of No. 20 Egged bus in Kiryat Menahem, Jerusalem,  November 21, 2002 \u2013 Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs",
