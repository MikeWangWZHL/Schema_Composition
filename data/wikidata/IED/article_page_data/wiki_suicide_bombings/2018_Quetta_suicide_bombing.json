    "article": "On 25 July 2018, during polling for the 2018 Pakistani general election, a bomb blast outside a polling station in Quetta's Eastern Bypass area resulted in 31 people being killed and over 35 injured. Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the group\u2019s Amaq News Agency.\n\n== Attack ==\n\"The bomber was trying to enter the polling station. When police tried to stop him, he blew himself,\" a local administration official in Quetta, Hashim Ghilzai, has said. According to Bomb Disposal Squad, 18-20 kilograms of explosives were used in the suicide attack.\n\n== Responsibility ==\nIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the group\u2019s Amaq news agency. The group said the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber, but did not provide further detail or evidence for its claim.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nElection Commission of Pakistan (ECP) while condemning the attack had summoned report from Balochistan government.
