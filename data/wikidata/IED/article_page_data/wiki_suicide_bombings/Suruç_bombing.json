    "article": "The Suru\u00e7 bombing took place in the Suru\u00e7 district of \u015eanl\u0131urfa Province in Turkey at approximately 12:00 local time on 20 July 2015, outside the Amara Culture Centre. 33 people were killed and 104 were reported injured. Most victims were members of the Socialist Party of the Oppressed (ESP) Youth Wing and the Socialist Youth Associations Federation (SGDF), university students who were giving a press statement on their planned trip to reconstruct the Syrian border town of Koban\u00ee.\n\nKoban\u00ee, which is approximately 10\u00a0km from Suru\u00e7, was until January under siege by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) forces. More than 300 members of the SGDF had travelled from \u0130stanbul to Suru\u00e7 to participate in three to four days of rebuilding work in Koban\u00ee, and had been staying at Amara Cultural Centre while preparing to cross the border. The explosion, which was caught on camera, was identified as being caused by a suicide attack.\n\nThe next day, ISIL (the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) claimed responsibility for the attack. ISIL had allegedly made the decision to pursue more active operations in Turkey just days before the attack. The attacker, \u015eeyh Abdurrahman Alag\u00f6z (20), an ethnic Kurd from Ad\u0131yaman, reportedly had links to Islamic State militants.\n\nThis was possibly the first planned attack by ISIL on Turkish soil, although previous incidents such as the 2013 Reyhanl\u0131 bombings, the 2015 Istanbul suicide bombing, and the 2015 Diyarbak\u0131r rally bombings have also been blamed by some on ISIL. The bombing resulted in a new escalation between Turkey and ISIL, with Turkish soldiers and ISIL militants directly engaging in the border town of Kilis on 24 July 2015. This led to Turkey launching Operation Martyr Yal\u00e7\u0131n, a series of airstrikes against mostly Kurdish militant positions in Northern Iraq and Syria. Large-scale operations against PKK, but including some ISIL targets, began on 24 July; however, most arrests were of PKK members.\nThe bombing was met with international condemnation by a variety of organizations, as well as promises by the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) to tighten the Turkish-Syrian border following the attack. The opposition criticised the government for not securing the border beforehand, while the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) also came under scrutiny for endorsing the crossing of the victims past the border despite significant threats from ISIL.\n\n==Background==\nThe district of Suru\u00e7 is located on the Syrian-Turkish border in the Province of \u015eanl\u0131urfa, approximately  from the Syrian town of Koban\u00ee. The populations of both Suru\u00e7 and Koban\u00ee are mostly Kurds, with the cultural ties between the two having resulted in deadly riots in south-eastern Turkey in October 2014 when Koban\u00ee was under siege by Islamic State militants. The riots had mainly protested the Turkish government's lack of intervention in Koban\u00ee against ISIL. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan claimed he was not prepared to launch operations against ISIL unless it was also against the forces of Bashar Al Assad. Furthermore, allegations of covert funding and the arming of ISIL by the Turkish government, which came under particular scrutiny following the 2014 M\u0130T lorries scandal, also caused heavy controversy.\n\n===The Siege of Koban\u00ee (2014\u201315)===\n\nKoban\u00ee was retaken from ISIL forces in late January 2015, with the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) taking full control of the city. ISIL vowed to return, committing a series of massacres in the city in June 2015. The Socialist Youth Associations Federation (SGDF) of Turkey requested permission to cross the border and participate in the reconstruction of the war-torn city.\n\n===Turkish invasion threats===\n\nDuring late June and early July 2015, the Turkish and Jordanian governments made threats to invade Syria and set up buffer zones. Turkey also agreed to let the United States of America use Turkish bases for drone strikes against ISIL.\n\n==Explosion==\n===Perceived targets===\nThe bombing appeared to target members of the Socialist Youth Associations Federation (SGDF), the Youth Wing of the Socialist Party of the Oppressed (ESP), of which 300 members had travelled to Suru\u00e7 from \u0130stanbul in order to cross the border into Koban\u00ee to take part in reconstruction projects there. The members were staying at the Amara Culture Centre and were giving a press statement on the reconstruction of Koban\u00ee when the bombings took place. Shortly after the bombing in Suru\u00e7, there was an explosion at an old mortar warehouse in Koban\u00ee itself.\n\n===Bombing===\nA survivor present at the press statement when the bombing took place, theatre actor Murat Akda\u011f, said that the bomb exploded in the middle of the group listening to the statement being made. Wounds on casualties taken to hospital showed evidence of burns and cluster bomb fragments. A spokesperson for the municipality of Suru\u00e7 added that there was the potential for a second bombing, asking individuals close to the Amara Cultural Centre to evacuate the area. Initial reports identified an 18-year-old female suicide bomber as the perpetrator, although the government later formally identified a male disguised as a woman as the detonator of the bomb. The Turkish government began investigating domestic and international affiliations of the suspect shortly after identification.\n\n==Perpetrators==\nOn 21 July, website Euronews reported that ISIL had claimed the attack.\n\nOn 22 July, some Turkish media reports indicated the suspected perpetrator, \u015eeyh Abdurrahman Alag\u00f6z, whose ID card was found at the scene, was a 20-year-old Turkish Kurd from Ad\u0131yaman who had been recruited by ISIL six months earlier.\n\nThe pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) however named a 20-year-old woman, whom the police had recently released from custody, as perpetrator.\n\nAnother media report pointed at Dokumac\u0131lar, an ISIL-linked terrorist group.\n\n==Reactions==\n===Domestic reactions===\n\nThe Prime Minister of Turkey, Ahmet Davuto\u011flu, formed a crisis meeting and sent Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmu\u015f, Interior Minister Sebahattin \u00d6zt\u00fcrk and Minister of Labour and Social Security Faruk \u00c7elik to Suru\u00e7 to follow developments. Deputy Prime Minister Yal\u00e7\u0131n Akdo\u011fan condemned the bombing, stating on social media that Turkey would never yield to such terrorist attacks.\n\nThe President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, was in Northern Cyprus at the time of the bombing. In a statement, he condemned the attack and offered condolences to the relatives of the victims. He further claimed that government ministers would continue their investigations. Former President Abdullah G\u00fcl also condemned the attack and offered condolences.\n\nThe Governor of \u015eanl\u0131urfa, \u0130zzettin K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck, confirmed that the explosion was a result of a suicide bombing, but caused controversy when it emerged that he had previously claimed that there was no threat from ISIL to \u015eanl\u0131urfa before the bombing.\n\nThe Ministry of the Interior warned soon after the bombing occurred that casualties were likely to rise, adding that the perpetrators would be caught and brought to justice as soon as possible.\n\nThe Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) chairman Selahattin Demirta\u015f claimed that the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) were responsible for the attack, claiming the bombing could not have taken place without assistance from the state. The HDP's parliamentary group leader Pervin Buldan released a statement claiming that the HDP would treat the attacks as a suicide bombing perpetrated by ISIL until more reliable information is made available. HDP Member of Parliament Dengir Mir Mehmet F\u0131rat claimed that the target of the attack was the Turkish Republic itself. HDP Adana Member of Parliament Meral Dan\u0131\u015f Be\u015fta\u015f called the attack a 'massacre' and said the HDP Central Executive Committee would meet to discuss the bombing.\n\nThe main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) also sent a delegation to Suru\u00e7 formed of ten MPs led by CHP Deputy Leader Sezgin Tanr\u0131kulu. Another CHP Deputy Leader, G\u00fcrsel Tekin, stated that his party had consistently warned the government that the border between Syria and Turkey had been left undefended, while Tanr\u0131kulu criticised the AKP for being responsible for Turkey's situation.\n\nThe Kurdish con-federalist Group of Communities in Kurdistan (KCK) held the AKP responsible, accusing the AKP of funding ISIL, thus contributing to its terrorist attacks and efforts. The PKK blamed the Turkish government for the attack, saying the government is conspiring with ISIL.\nThis anger of the PKK contributed to PKK revenge attacks (see section Aftermath).\n\n===International reactions===\n*  - Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan released a statement condemning the attack and offering condolences to the families of the dead.\n*  - The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemned and extended deepest sympathy to the families of the victims. Ministry believes that perpetrators will be brought to justice.\n*  - The European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighborhood Policy Johannes Hahn using his Twitter account expressed condolences to people of Suru\u00e7 noting that again Syrian crisis influenced tragically neighboring countries.\n*  - The German Minister for Foreign Affairs, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, stated that Turkey was an important partner in fighting terror and offered sympathies with the injured and relatives of the dead. He stated that the fact that the attack targeted young people was particularly horrific.\n*  - The Youth Wing of the governing SYRIZA party of Greece released a statement stating that they would continue the work of their 32 fallen comrades.\n*  - The President of Northern Cyprus, Mustafa Ak\u0131nc\u0131, issued a joint press statement alongside Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who was visiting Northern Cyprus when the attack occurred. In his statement, Ak\u0131nc\u0131 said terrorism should always be condemned, regardless of its origin or methods.\n*  - The Pakistan embassy in Ankara released a statement reiterating Pakistan's unconditional condemnation for all attacks of terrorism and offered their condolences to the Turkish government and the Turkish people.\n*  - Terrorist attack condemned by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev expressed his condolences to relatives of the victims. Russian Federal Agency for Tourism urged Russian citizens vacationing in Turkey to remain in protected tourist areas and not to leave them for their own safety.\n*  - Togolese President Komi S\u00e9lom Klassou. expressed his sadness at the event. Togolese citizens living in Turkey were advised to flee the area.\n*  - The British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Philip Hammond, issued a statement on Twitter condemning the bombing and offering his sympathies for the injured and families of those killed.\n*  - The US embassy in Ankara released a statement condemning the attack and offering condolences to the families of the dead.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n\n=== Demonstrations ===\nDemonstrations were held in several provinces of Turkey to protest the attack. During a protest attended by approximately 1,000 people in Mersin two protestors were shot and lightly wounded by an unknown perpetrator with a hunting rifle.\n\n=== Ceylanp\u0131nar's double assassination ===\n\nTwo days after the bombing in Suru\u00e7 two police officers were found dead in the same building in the district of Ceylanp\u0131nar, which is also in \u015eanl\u0131urfa Province. At least one of the officers was identified as working for an anti-terrorism task force. The PKK claimed responsibility for the attack, as a revenge act for the events in Suru\u00e7. Following a statement from the \u015eanl\u0131urfa Governor \u0130zzettin K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck, a ban on press coverage came into effect and Twitter was blocked while sensitive content was removed from the site. 9 people were anonymously denounced and accused of the assassinations. As of April 16, 2019, the 9 accuses acquittal is uphelp by the Higher Court of Turkey. The assassinations is now commented as the casus belli used to drop the 2013-2015 Solution process, revive nationalist fervor and undo the June 2015 Turkey elections via the November 2015 Turkey elections.\n\n=== Anti-PKK offensives ===\nIn raids across the country, nearly 600 terror suspects were arrested including alleged members of ISIS. However the majority of those arrested were members of non-Islamist groups such as the PKK, Revolutionary People's Liberation Party\u2013Front and other left-wing groups.\n\nOn the following Friday, 24 July, Turkey for the first time carried out airstrikes against ISIS positions in Syria near the Turkish border, without entering Syrian airspace. However, the same day Turkey also began airstrikes against PKK camps in northern Iraq, despite the fact the PKK is fighting against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.\n\nOn the Saturday following the airstrikes the president of Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government, Masoud Barzani, called Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu. He urged Turkey to halt its airstrikes against the PKK over their territory and resolve their problem through negotiations.\n\n==See also==\n\n* List of terrorist incidents in 2015\n* 2015 Diyarbak\u0131r rally bombings\n* Turkish involvement in the Syrian Civil War\n* 2013 Reyhanl\u0131 bombings\n* Spillover of the Syrian Civil War\n* Turkey\u2013ISIL conflict\n\n==References==\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople killed by a suicide attack in Suru\u00e7.",
