Two car bombs exploded in al-Shaab, west of Aden, and an ambulance exploded near a checkpoint in the center of the city of Mansoura, declared \"provisional\" capital of Yemen, since its resumption in July 2015 by pro-government forces, after their fight against the Shiite Houthi rebels. The Yemeni branch of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\n==References==",
