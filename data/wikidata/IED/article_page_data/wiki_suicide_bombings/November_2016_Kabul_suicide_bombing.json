At least 32 people have been killed and above 80 were injured in a suicide bombing at a Kabul Shia mosque \"Baqir-ul-Olum\". People including women and children were commemorating Arba'een rituals.

It was just one in a string of major attacks in Kabul during 2016, and the third to be claimed by ISIL.\n\n==Reactions==\n\n===Domestic===\nPresident Ashraf Ghani strongly condemned the attack by calling the attack on the mosque an unforgivable and a major crime committed by the enemies of the country. He also further added that attacks on sacred and religious sites are a sign of clear enmity with Islam and the Afghan people.\n\n===Supranational bodies===\n*  - \"We offer our condolences to the families of the innocent men, women and children killed and wounded in today's attack. We will continue to stand with our Afghan partners and do everything possible to secure a peaceful, stable Afghanistan,\" commander of the Resolute Support Mission, Gen. John Nicholson said in a statement.\n*  - \"This appalling attack on worshippers is an atrocity, UNAMA expresses its revulsion at this latest effort by extremists to stoke sectarian violence in Afghanistan,\" said Pernille Kardel, the UN deputy special representative for Afghanistan said. She also added that \"Religious and ethnic tolerance are values the Afghan people hold strong, and I urge the Afghan authorities to do everything possible to defend Afghans of all faiths.\"\n\n===Countries===\n*  - Ned Price, spokesman of the National Security Council at the White House strongly condemning the terrorist attack by saying \"This cowardly attack was clearly intended to stoke sectarian tensions in Afghanistan\". He also added that \"We extend our deepest condolences to the families and friends of the victims of this attack and fully support efforts to bring those responsible to justice. The United States and our international partners remain committed to the people and Government of Afghanistan as we work together to build a more stable and prosperous peaceful Afghanistan\".\n*  - The government of Pakistan strongly condemns the suicide attack at the Baqir-ul-Ulum Mosque in Kabul that has led to loss of a number of precious lives and left many injured,\" the foreign ministry said in a statement. It also added that \"Pakistan conveys profound condolences to the families of those who lost their lives and prayers for early recovery of the injured\".\n*  - Prime minister Narendra Modi condemned the terror attack by saying \"For regional peace and security, all sanctuaries, safe havens and support to such terrorists must end\".
