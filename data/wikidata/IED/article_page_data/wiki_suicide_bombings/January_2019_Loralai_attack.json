    "article": "2019 Loralai attack took place on 29 January 2019 in Loralai, Balochistan, Pakistan. Nine people (eight policemen and a civilian) were killed while 22 others were injured when gunmen and suicide bombers attacked a Deputy Inspector General's (DIG) office. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe Pashtun Tahafuz Movement protested against the attack and held sit-ins in Balochistan's Quetta and Loralai. However, when the police launched a crackdown against the nonviolent protesters, Arman Loni, one of the leaders of PTM, was killed in Loralai.\n\nAnother attack occurred in Loralai on 16 February 2019.\n\n==References==",
