    "article": "The Dayah Hotel attack occurred on 25 January 2017 when a hotel in the Somali capital city Mogadishu was attacked by Al-Shabaab gunmen and car bombs, killing 28 people and injuring 43 others. Taking place shortly after 08:00 on a Wednesday morning, the attack began when a car filled with explosives rammed the gate of the Dayah Hotel, a luxury hotel popular with politicians, and detonated. Immediately after, four armed militants attempted to storm the hotel \u2013 however Somali security guards shot the men dead before they reached it. As emergency services and journalists converged on the scene, a second car bomb detonated, causing more casualties.\n\nRadio Andalus, a station with links to Al-Shabaab, reported that \"well-armed mujahideen attacked the hotel, and now they are fighting inside the hotel.\" The attack came shortly before the date of the country's presidential election was due to be announced.\n\n==See also==\n* Makka al-Mukarama hotel attack\n* Jazeera Palace Hotel bombing\n* June 2016 Mogadishu attacks\n* February 2017 Mogadishu bombing\n* Asasey Hotel attack\n\n==References==",
