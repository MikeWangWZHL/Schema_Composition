    "article": "The Bat Mitzvah massacre was a terrorist attack in Hadera, Israel, on Thursday, January 17, 2002, in which a Palestinian gunman, 24-year-old Abdul Salaam Sadek Hassouneh, killed six people and wounded 33 at a Bat Mitzvah celebration, a traditional Jewish celebration held for a 12-year-old girl.\n\n==Attack==\nThe attack took place at 9:45 pm (GMT+2) as guests were departing. The al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades  assumed responsibility for the attack, claiming it was vengeance for the killing of its leader Raed Karmi. An Israeli police spokesman said the man, apparently on a suicide mission, had thrown several grenades into the Armon David wedding hall, where the Bat Mitzvah celebration had taken place, and detonated explosives on himself. A belt filled with explosives was found on the attacker.\n\n=== Victims ===\n* Boris Melikhov, 56, of Sderot\n* Aharon Ellis, 32, of Ra'anana\n* Anatoly Bakshiev, 62, of Or Akiva\n* Avi Yazdi, 24, of Or Akiva\n* Edward Bakshayev, 48, of Or Akiva\n* Dina Binayev, 48, of Ashkelon\n\n== Media coverage ==\nThe Al Jazeera television network was criticized for bias in coverage of the massacre, failing to note that the victims were attending a bat mitzvah and that the gunman crashed the event at a crowded banquet hall, and failing to mention the number of people killed by Raed Karmi when covering his assassination several days earlier, which would have provided context for the story.\n\n== Perpetrator ==\nThe al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades said the attacker, 24-year-old Abdel Salam Hassouna, was from a village near Nablus and launched the attack to avenge the death of Raed Karmi.\n\nAfter the attack a video made earlier by the attacker was released, in which he is seen declaring: \"I am doing this to avenge all the Palestinian martyrs.\"\n\n== Official reactions ==\n\n;Involved parties\n\n\n:\n* The Palestinian Authority condemned the attack but blamed Israel for provoking it.\n\n;International\n* : the US government condemned the Hadera attack \"in the strongest possible terms,\" calling it a \"horrific act of terrorism.\"\n\n==See also==\n* List of massacres in Israel\n* Palestinian political violence\n* Passover massacre\n\n==References==\n\n\n== External links ==\n*  Seven killed in attack in Israel - published on BBC News on January 18, 2002\n*  Seven Suicide terrorist kills 6 at Bat Mitzvah in Israel - published on the New York Post on January 18, 2002",
