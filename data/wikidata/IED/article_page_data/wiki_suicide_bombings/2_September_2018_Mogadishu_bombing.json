It also caused a nearby school to collapse, damaged nearby houses, and blew the roof off a mosque, as well as destroying the targeted building.\n\n==Reaction==\nShortly after the attack, the Islamist militant group al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack. The group has often targeted the capital with bombings, including a truck bomb in October 2017 that killed 587 people.\n\n==References==",
