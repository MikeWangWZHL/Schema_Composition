The responsibility for the attacks was claimed by ISIL.\n\n==Attacks==\nIn the first attack a suicide bomber detonated his explosive vest around 6 p.m. local time at the Maiwand Wrestling Club. The second explosion took place when a car packed with explosives was detonated by the time emergency services, journalists and police had gathered at the scene.\n\nThe witnesses said on social media that the attacker killed the club guards before blowing himself up inside the club.\n\n==Casualties==\nThe toll were initially reported to be 20 killed and 70 injured but a later report by the deputy spokesman for the Ministry of Interior of Afghanistan said that the casualties had increased to 26 dead and 91 injured. Tolo News, a private broadcaster, said two of its \"best journalists\", Samim Faramarz, 28 and Ramiz Ahmadi, 23 were killed in the second attack  and NAI said at least four other journalists were among the wounded people also in the second attack. Hashmat Stanekzai, the Kabul police spokesman, said the second explosion came when police were helping victims and as a result some of officers were wounded.\n\n==See also==\n*List of terrorist incidents in September 2018\n*September 2016 Kabul attacks\n\n==References==\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategorY:Mass murder in 2018\n\nCategorY:Mass murder in Afghanistan",
