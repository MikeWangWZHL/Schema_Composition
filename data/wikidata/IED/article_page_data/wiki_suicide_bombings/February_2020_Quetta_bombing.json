    "article": "On 17 February 2020, a suicide bombing occurred in Quetta, Balochistan, Pakistan. The attacker was on a motorcycle and detonated his bomb as police tried to stop him entering a Sunni extremist religious rally near a press club. At least 10 people - including two police officers - were killed and another 35 people were injured.\n\nNo one has claimed responsibility for the attack. Quetta is frequently attacked by Sunni Islamists as well as by Baloch separatist insurgents.\n\n==References==",
