    "article": "The King George Street bombing was a suicide bombing which occurred on March 21, 2002 outside a clothing store and toy shop on King George Street in Jerusalem. Three Israeli civilians were killed in the attack.\n\nThe Palestinian militant organization al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\n==The attack==\nOn Thursday afternoon, 21 March 2002, a Palestinian suicide bomber detonated the explosive device, hidden underneath his jacket, in the middle of Jerusalem's shopping district in the King George Street in downtown Jerusalem amongst a crowd of shoppers.\n\nThe blast killed three civilians and more than 40 people were wounded, seven of them seriously.\n\n=== Fatalities ===\n* Yitzhak Cohen, 48, of Modi'in\n* Tsipi Shemesh, 29 (5 months pregnant with twins)\n* Gadi Shemesh, 34\n\n== The perpetrators ==\nAfter the attack the Palestinian militia al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades claimed responsibility for the bombing and stated that the perpetrator was Mohammad Hashaika, a 22-year-old from the West Bank village of Talluza near Nablus. Hashaika was a member of the Tanzim and a former Palestinian policeman. Later on, it was revealed that Hashaika was actually arrested for allegedly planning to carry out an earlier attack. Nevertheless, the Palestinian authority released him a week before he managed to carry out this suicide bombing.\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n*  Bomb rips through Jerusalem shopping centre - published on The Guardian on 21 March 2002\n*  Jerusalem Blast Kills 3, Hurts 100 - published on The Daily News of New York City on 22 March 2002",
