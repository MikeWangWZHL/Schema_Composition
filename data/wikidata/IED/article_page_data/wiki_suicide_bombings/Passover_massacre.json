    "article": "The Passover massacre was a suicide bombing carried out by Hamas at the Park Hotel in Netanya, Israel on 27 March 2002, during a Passover seder. Thirty civilians were killed in the attack and 140 were injured. It was the deadliest attack against Israelis during the Second Intifada.\n\n==The attack==\n\nDuring the Jewish holiday of Passover in 2002, Park Hotel in the Israeli coastal city of Netanya held its traditional annual Passover seder for its 250 guests, in the hotel dining room located at the ground floor of the hotel.\n\nOn the evening of 27 March 2002, a Palestinian bomber, Abdel-Basset Odeh (or Abd Al-Baset Odeh), disguised as a woman approached the hotel carrying a suitcase which contained powerful explosives. The suicide bomber managed to pass the security guard at the entrance to a hotel, then he walked through the lobby passing the reception desk and entered the hotel's crowded dining room.\n\nAt 19:30 (GMT+2) the suicide bomber detonated the explosive device he was carrying. The force of the explosion instantly killed 28 civilians and injured about 140 people, of whom 20 were injured severely. Two of the injured later died from their wounds. Some of the victims were Holocaust survivors.\n\nMost of the victims were senior citizens (70 and over). The oldest victim was 90 and the youngest was 20 years old. A number of married couples were killed, as well as a father together with his daughter. One of the victims was a Jewish tourist from Sweden who was visiting Israel for Passover.\n\nSeventy-three of the 140 injured in the attack were evacuated to Laniado Hospital in neighboring Kiryat Sanz, Netanya. Although established as a regional hospital, Laniado had established a trauma center and emergency protocol in the wake of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks in the Netanya area during the Second Intifada. In addition to medical teams, the hospital benefited from the volunteerism of Hasidim living in Kiryat Sanz, who donated blood, carried stretchers, and otherwise assisted the medical staff.\n\nThe initial plot for the Passover massacre included the use of cyanide; 4\u00a0kg of cyanide had been bought and prepared for a chemical attack. Tarak Zidan had been recruited to Hamas, and during 1997 he researched the use of chlorine and other nerve agents to be used in terror attacks. In 2002, 4\u00a0kg of chlorine had been bought and packed for the attack. For unknown reasons it was not used and passed to Abbas al-Sayyid instead.\n\n==Victims==\n\n\n; Families\n\n* Shula Abramovitch, 63, of Holon\n* David Anichovitch, 70, of Netanya\n* Alter Britvich, 88, of Netanya\n* Frieda Britvich, 86, of Netanya\n* Andre Fried, 47, of Netanya\n* Idit Fried, 47, of Netanya\n* Dvora Karim, 73, of Netanya\n* Michael Karim, 78, of Netanya\n* Eliezer Korman, 74, of Ramat HaSharon\n* Yehudit Korman, 70, of Ramat HaSharon\n* St.-Sgt.

The bomber was identified as Abdel-Basset Odeh (Abd Al-Baset Odeh), a 25-year-old from the nearby West Bank city of Tulkarm. Hamas spokesman Abdel Aziz Rantisi said, \"[a]s long as there is occupation, there will be a resistance\" and denied that the attack was timed to coincide with the peace initiative of the Saudi government at the Beirut Summit, an initiative rejected by Hamas.\n\n==Official reactions==\n; Involved parties\n:\n* Israeli government spokesman Gideon Meir related to the attack saying \"what we had tonight was a Passover massacre\" and added \"There is no limit to Palestinian barbarism.\"\n\n:\n* Palestinian National Authority: Palestinian Authority officials \"strongly condemned\" the attack.\n* During a television broadcast on the Palestinian TV channel, Yasser Arafat praised the Palestinian people for the current popular uprising against Israel, but stressed that \"We are against killing civilians on both sides\".\n*The Zionist Organization of America and Palestinian Media Watch reported that the Palestinian Authority sponsored a soccer tournament named the \"Tulkarm Shahids Memorial soccer championship tournament of the Shahid Abd Al-Baset Odeh\" describing the perpetrator as a \"shahid\" (\"martyr\"), claiming this promotes and glorifies terrorism. 71% of Palestinians polled about this event approved of naming a soccer tournament in honor of the bomber.\n\n; Supranational\n* : Kofi Annan, United Nations Secretary General stated that he condemned suicide bombings against Israeli civilians as morally repugnant.\n\n; International\n* : President of the United States George W. Bush condemned the attack and called on Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian Authority to do everything in their power to stop the terrorist killing.\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Diplomacy===\nIn his response to the Saudi initiative adopted at the Beirut Summit, Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel Shimon Peres noted that \"\u2026 the details of every peace plan must be discussed directly between Israel and the Palestinians, and to make this possible, the Palestinian Authority must put an end to terror, the horrifying expression of which we witnessed just last night in Netanya.\"\n\n===Israeli retaliation===\n\nThe attack was perceived in Israel as the high point of a bloody month in which more than 135 Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed in terror attacks.\n\nFollowing the Passover massacre attack the Israeli government declared a state of emergency, ordered the immediate recruitment of 20,000 reservists in an emergency call-up, and in the following day launched the large-scale counter-terrorism operation Operation Defensive Shield in the West Bank which took place between 29 March and 10 May.\n\nQeis Adwan, head of the suicide bombing network responsible for the massacre, was killed by IDF forces on 5 April 2002 during Operation Defensive Shield, after the IDF and the Yamam caught him in Tubas, some 70 kilometers north of Jerusalem. An armored IDF Caterpillar D9 bulldozer toppled the house where he was hiding, after he was given a chance to surrender and refused.\n\n===Arrests and killings of perpetrators===\nOne of the two chief planners of the attack, Qais Adwan, a Hamas member who was involved in numerous attacks in which a total of 77 people were killed, was killed in a shootout with the IDF during Operation Defensive Shield. In May 2002, Israeli forces arrested the other chief planner, Abbas al-Sayed. On 22 September 2005, al-Sayed was convicted of the Passover attack and also of ordering the May 2001 bombing of a Netanya mall. He received 35 life sentences for each murder victim and additional time for those who were wounded.\n\nFathi Khatib, who transported the bomber to his target, Mohand Sharim, who financed the operation and helped hide the bomber, Muammar Abu Sheikh, who recruited the bomber to Hamas and transferred the explosive belts used in the attack to an explosives expert for examination, and Nasser Yatiya, who helped transport the explosive belts, were tried and convicted together in an Israeli military court in April 2003 and handed 29 life sentences. Nasser Yatiya was released in the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange in 2011. Muhammad Taher, who prepared the explosive charges, was killed in a clash with Israeli Shayetet 13 naval commandos in June 2003.\n\nOn 26 March 2008 Hamas commander Omar Jabar, suspected of helping organize the attack, was arrested in Tulkarem by IDF troops of the Nahshon Battalion. In March 2013 he was convicted over his role and sentenced to 30 years in prison.\n\nIn September 2009, Muhammad Harwish, a senior Hamas militant and a planner of the Passover Massacre, was arrested by the Border Police's elite Yamam counter-terror squad in his home village along with an aide, Adnan Samara.\n\n===Soccer Championship tournament===\nIn 2003, the Palestinian Authority sponsored a soccer tournament, Tulkarm Shahids Memorial Soccer Championship Tournament of the Shahid Abd Al-Baset Odeh, describing the perpetrator as a \"shahid\" (\"martyr\").\n\n==See also==\n* List of massacres in Israel\n* List of terrorist incidents, 2002\n* List of Hamas suicide attacks\n* Battle of Jenin\n* Israeli casualties of war\n* Palestinian political violence\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n*  Passover suicide bombing at Park Hotel in Netanya \u2013 27 March 2002 \u2013 published at the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n*  \"Alleged Passover massacre plotter arrested\", CNN, 26 March 2008.\n*  \"Hotel blast survivors relive the Passover massacre\" The Daily Telegraph 29 March 2002\n*  US President George W Bush \"This cold blooded killing must stop\", 27 March 2002\n*  Israeli Government spokesman Gideon Meir \"Palestinian violence knows no boundaries\", 27 March 2002\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPark Hotel in Netanya.
