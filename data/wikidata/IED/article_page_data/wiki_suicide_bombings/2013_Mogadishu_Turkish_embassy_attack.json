At around 5:00\u00a0p.m. a minivan rigged with explosives detonated near the embassy compound. The explosion was followed by three armed militants attempting to storm the compound on foot, but they were repelled and killed by Turkish and Somali security guards.\n\nAl-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement. saying \u201cMujahideen forces in Mogadishu have just carried out an operation targeting a group of Turkish diplomats in Hodan district.\u201d The U.S. State Department labeled the attack a \"cowardly act\" while the United Nations Security Council released a statement condemning it in \"strongest terms.\"\n\n==See also==\n* June 2013 Mogadishu attack\n* 2009 African Union base bombings in Mogadishu\n* 2015 Ministry of Higher Education attack\n\n==References==",
