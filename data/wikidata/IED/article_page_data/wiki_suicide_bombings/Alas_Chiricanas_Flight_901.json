    "article": "Alas Chiricanas Flight 00901, registered  HP-1202AC, was an Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante aircraft flying en route from Col\u00f3n city to Panama City which exploded shortly after departing Enrique Adolfo Jim\u00e9nez Airport, on the night of July 19, 1994. All 21 on board, including 12 Jews, were killed in the bombing. Both Panamanian and American authorities consider the bombing an unsolved crime and an act of terrorism.\n\nThe wreckage of the Bandeirante was strewn about the Santa Rita Mountains near Col\u00f3n. Panamanian investigators quickly determined that the explosion had been caused by a bomb, probably detonated by a suicide bomber aboard the aircraft. Only one body was not claimed by relatives; this body is believed to be that of a man named Jamal Lya.  Officials suspected that the incident was an act of terrorism by  Hezbollah directed against Jews in part because it took place one day after the AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires, and due to an expression of support by \"Ansar Allah\", a Hezbollah affiliate in South America.\n\nIn 2018, the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela said \"recent evidence\" and intelligence reports \"clearly show it was a terrorist attack,\" and that he would ask local and international authorities to reopen the investigation. The FBI have in its investigations identified the perpetrator to have been a passenger named Ali Hawa Jamal.\n\n==See also==\n*List of unsolved deaths\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n* Acquittals in Argentine terror case cast a shadow across Panama\n* Argentine trials may shed light on Panama mystery,  Eric Jackson, Panama News Online, 17 October 2001.\n* \"Seeking Information\" page for Jamal Lya from the U.
