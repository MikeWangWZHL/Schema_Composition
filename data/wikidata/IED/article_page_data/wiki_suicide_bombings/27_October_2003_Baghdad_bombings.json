The attacks killed 35 people and injured another 244.\n\nThe bombings all occurred within about 45 minutes of each other. Four suicide bombers died but the fifth, a Syrian, who attempted to blow up the fourth police station, failed after the man's car apparently failed to explode. He was shot and wounded by the Iraqi police and arrested.\n\n==External links==\n\n* Up to 40 Killed, 200 Injured in Series of Baghdad Bombings\n* DEADLY ATTACKS\n* Baghdad Hotel Bombing, March 17, 2004\n* Bloody day in Baghdad, dozens killed in car bombs",
