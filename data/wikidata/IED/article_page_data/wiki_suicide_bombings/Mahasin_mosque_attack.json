The attack left four people plus the attacker dead and 18 others injured. The attack consisted of a shooting and suicide bombing and was allegedly directed by ISIL. \n\nThe two attackers, Abdurrahman Abdullah Suleiman al-Tuwaijiri (22-year old Saudi citizen) and Talha Hisham Mohammed Abda (Egyptian national), attempted to detonate themselves during Friday prayers at the mosque. Whilst Abdurrahman successfully blew himself up, Talha failed and he was arrested after the attacks.\n\n==See also==\n* List of terrorist incidents in Saudi Arabia\n* List of terrorist incidents, January\u2013June 2016\n* List of terrorist incidents linked to ISIL\n\n==References==",
