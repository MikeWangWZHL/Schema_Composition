    "article": "The 2011 Minsk Metro bombing occurred on 11 April 2011 when at least 15 people were killed and more than two hundred were injured in an explosion on the Minsk Metro, Belarus. The explosion happened at the central Kastry\u010dnickaja station at 17:55 local time.\n\nInitially the cause of the explosion was unclear, but was found to have been a bomb containing nails and ball bearings. President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko asserted that the explosion was aimed at undermining \"peace and stability\" and hinted at possible foreign involvement but also ordered an emergency investigation of domestic weapon storage facilities. The Prosecution Office launched a criminal investigation and classified the event as a terrorist attack.\n\nTwo suspects arrested on 13 April confessed to the bombing according to Belarus' deputy prosecutor general Andrei Shved. According to him they also pleaded guilty to Vitebsk cafe and Victory day bombings but the motives remain unclear. The investigation, which included law enforcement agencies from Russia, Israel and Interpol confirmed this view. Interpol stated that fingerprint evidence confirmed that the 2008 Victory day bombings and the 2011 Metro were committed by the same person.\nThe trials attracted international political condemnation and the verdicts passed out have been questioned, primarily by the Belarusian opposition and the EU. The bombing came at a time of economic problems and protests against Lukashenko's government. Natalia Koliada of the Belarus Free Theatre believes that the national intelligence agency of Belarus planted the device, rigged a show trial and tortured confessions out of the two suspects. According to the investigation, the bomb was unique and the foreign investigators also expressed great interest in it. In March 2012 both men (Kanavalau and Kavalyou) were executed by shooting.\n\n==Background==\nThe explosion in the Minsk metro led to the country's largest loss of life since 53 people were crushed to death at Nemiga in 1999. Previous bombings in the recent history of Belarus did not result in any fatalities. In September 2005, two bombings occurred in the northeastern city of Vitebsk. The former was blamed on criminal gangs, and the latter, in which 46 people were injured, was blamed on hooliganism.\n\nDuring the Belarus Independence Day celebrations on 4 July 2008, fifty people were injured when a bomb exploded at a concert in Minsk. Like the bombing at the Vitebsk cafe in 2005, the concert bombing in Minsk was blamed on hooliganism, and President Lukashenko stated that he didn't believe he was the target.\n\n==Incident==\n\n\n\n\n\nThe explosion happened at about 18:00 during rush hour at Kastry\u010dnickaja station, which provides the sole interchange between the two lines of the Minsk metro. Like nearly every station in Minsk, Kastry\u010dnickaja has an island platform, and during the explosion, trains were located on both tracks. According to the initial investigation, the bomb was located under a bench next to the inbound (Institut Kultury-bound) tracks. The bomb exploded next to the second car of an inbound train. At the moment of the explosion, there were 300 people in the area and an outbound (Uruchye-bound) train passed through the station without stopping. According to witnesses, there was \"a flash and a bang\" as passengers exited a train which had arrived at the station. The bomb was reported to have been packed with nails and ball-bearings, with an explosive force equivalent to 5\u00a0kg of TNT. It was said to be under a bench on the platform and could have been detonated by remote control. Interior Minister Anatoly Kuleshov said the perpetrators sought to \"kill as many people as possible.\"\n\nThe explosion caused a hole 80\u00a0cm in diameter. It was so powerful that it shook trains at the adjacent stations Pl. Lenina and Pl. Pobedy. The blast was equivalent to five to seven kilograms of TNT. According to Interfax, the bomb was partially composed of fragments of metal. The device was packed with ball bearings, indicating that it was a nail bomb; most of the injuries from the blast were caused by shrapnel. It is believed that the explosive device was radio-controlled and that the bomb was of advanced technical quality.\n\n===Victims===\nThe wounded victims were admitted to five hospitals in Minsk. Among the injured, 22 were in a serious condition, one of them died in the hospital. Another 30 suffered injuries of moderate severity.\n\n\nA national day of mourning was declared for 13 April 2011. Black ribbons were attached to flags, and all entertainment events cancelled.\n\n==Infrastructure==\nLike all metros built during the Soviet period, the Minsk Metro contains many artistic elements such as stylised lighting and decorative ceilings.  In his speech following the explosion, the president suggested that the design of Kastry\u010dnickaja station may have worsened the injuries. \"The metro should be decorated in a way so that nothing will fall onto people's heads,\" Lukashenko said. \"Not only from a blast.  People also received injuries from objects that fell from the ceiling.\"\n\nFollowing the attacks, Interior Ministry began installing metal detectors to all stations.\n\n==Investigation==\nPresident Lukashenko ordered a thorough investigation into the explosion. \"There should be results every day.  Work day and night,\" Lukashenko told the Belarus security apparatus. He urged Belarusian security officials to get in touch with Russian security to aid in the investigation due to their experience with terrorist attacks in Moscow Metro.\n\nThe president said \"We have been thrown a serious challenge. It requires an adequate response and it must be found. They will not let us have a peaceful life, I want to know - who\". He made an appeal to the Belarusian population to assist in the apprehension of the perpetrators: \"I would like to address the people honestly and openly: without you it will be difficult for us to find these monsters. You must help us.\" He also ordered the full transparency of the investigation and the full availability of information to the citizens.\n\nThe Belarusian State Security Committee announced that they would pay anyone who had photos or videos of the attack. The opposition newspaper Nasha Niva provided certain material.\n\nThree residents of Minsk were detained \"for spreading provocative rumors, sowing panic\". These people were alleged to be spreading false information about the new bombings on Internet forums and social networking sites.\n\nThe head of the investigation group, Deputy Prosecutor General of Belarus Andrei Shved, announced that several people were arrested on 12 April and the facial composite of the bomber was released. The head of the Belarusian State Security Committee Vadim Zaitsev said that three versions of the causes of the terrorist attack were being investigated: as a destabilisation attempt, the action of an extremist anarchist organisation and the action of an unhealthy person. Following the arrests, he said that the third version was now considered the correct one, that the attack was an act of an unhealthy person. Through cooperation with international investigators, it was confirmed that the perpetrator of the Metro attack was also linked to the Victory day bombings in 2008.\n\nLukashenko declared that they may have knowledge into who \"ordered the attack\". He also claimed they had admitted their guilt and described the investigation by the police and the Belarusian State Security Committee as a \"brilliant operation\". He claimed that they admitted they were also guilty for the Vitebsk cafe and Independence Day attacks. He also said their motives remain unclear. It was reported that psychiatrists interviewed the prime suspect and that he said that he \"enjoyed the suffering of others\" and did not claim any political motives. However, they considered him sane.\n\n==International reaction==\n\n;Supranational bodies\n* \u2014 Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said \"I do not know about the exact motives of what happened, but, as reported, it was the result of deliberate action. If so, then this is totally unacceptable and must be condemned. Whatever were the motives behind it, one can never justify the use of violent methods.\"\n**The Security Council issued a statement calling the incident an \"apparent\" terrorist attack. A diplomat from one of the 15 states on the Council said that: \"The word 'apparent' is included in this statement for a reason. There are credible indications in Belarus saying there is a more than even chance that the government was behind this.\" Another diplomat said: \"There was a lot of debate about this statement which is why it came out so late. But it just highlights international suspicions.\" The final statement read that \"The members of the Security Council condemned in the strongest terms the apparent terrorist attack that occurred in Minsk, Republic of Belarus, on April 11, 2011, causing numerous deaths and injuries. They expressed their deep sympathy and condolences to the victims of this heinous act and to their families, and to the people and government of the Republic of Belarus.\"\n* \u2014 High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton said \"I deeply regret the tragic loss of lives in the blast, which occurred yesterday. I want to express my sincere condolences and support to families of the victims and the people of Belarus\". European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek expressed condolences and said \"I wish a speedy and full recovery to the injured.

At this difficult time, our thoughts are with the Belarusian people.\"\n* \u2014 A statement from the Foreign Ministry described the incident only as an \"explosion.\"\n* \u2014 Press secretary of President of Georgia Manana Manjgaladze said that \"The president and all Georgian people deeply sympathise with relatives and friends of those killed during the terrorist attack in Minsk\".\n* \u2014 Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman expressed his condolences.\n* \u2014 First Deputy Prime Minister Omurbek Babanov said that the \"terrorist attack in Belarus will not affect the decision of Kyrgyzstan to join the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan\".\n* \u2014 President Valdis Zatlers has expressed condolences to the people of Belarus in the wake of an explosion in the Minsk metro, particularly expressing his concern for those who were injured or killed in the event and expressed hope that those who were hurt will soon get better.

The next day condolences came from the Foreign Minister of Germany, Turkey, Iran, Italy, Russia on 13 April. The President's office also received condolences from leaders of Turkey, Slovakia, Cuba.\n\n;Political Reaction\nPolitical interests outside of Belarus has questioned the official version of events as well as the investigation and court precedings, repeatedly calling for Belarus to pardon those convicted as well as abolishing the death penalty. According to the EU the investigation was not properly conducted and subsequently the trial not conducted on legal grounds, this point of view has even led the German Parliament to officially question the objectivity of the international investigation, accusing Interpol of willfully acquiescing to the \"faulty\" evidence provided by Belarusian investigators.\n\n===International aid===\nIsrael, Russia, United Kingdom \u2014 The press service of the Belarusian president has reported that Israel, Russia and the United Kingdom have offered to help in the investigation.
