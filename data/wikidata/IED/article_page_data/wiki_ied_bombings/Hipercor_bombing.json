    "article": "The Hipercor massacre was a car bomb attack by the Basque separatist organisation ETA. It took place on 19 June 1987 at the Hipercor shopping centre on Avinguda Meridiana, Barcelona, Spain. The bombing killed 21 people and injured 45, the deadliest attack in ETA's history. Controversy surrounded the timing of telephone warnings made before the attack and the authorities' response to them.\n\n==Background==\nIn the two years before the attack, ETA detonated six car bombs in Barcelona that killed three people.\n\nUp to this point, Spain's deadliest terrorist attack had been the El Descanso bombing in Madrid by suspected Islamic militants which had killed 18\u00a0Spaniards and injured 82\u00a0others, including 11\u00a0American servicemen, who were believed to have been the target of the attack. The ETA attack which had caused the most fatalities had occurred on 14 July 1986 when a car bomb on Rep\u00fablica Dominicana Square in Madrid had killed 12\u00a0civil guards and injured 50\u00a0people.\n\nOn 10 June 1987, 10\u00a0days before the bombing, ETA's political wing Herri Batasuna had received its highest vote share in the European Parliament elections, becoming the most voted for party in the three Basque provinces.\n\n==Attack==\n===Preparations===\nActing on orders received from the ETA leader Santiago Arrospide Sarasola, \"Santi Potros\", three members of ETA's 'Barcelona Commando' Josefa Ernaga, Domingo Troiti\u00f1o and Rafael Caride Sim\u00f3n, decided to place an incendiary bomb inside a Hipercor store.\n\nThe three visited various commercial centres and selected one where a car could be parked. They then met in a flat in Calle Casteldefels, Barcelona and assembled a bomb containing 30 kilos of ammonal and 100 litres of gasoline together with a timer device and an indeterminate quantity of glue and flakes of soap to create a bomb weighing up to 200 kilograms. This was then placed in a stolen Ford Sierra.\n\n===Bombing===\nThe attack occurred on a Friday afternoon. The car bomb, hidden in the boot of the vehicle, had been placed on the first floor of the three-storey subterranean car park below the commercial centre.\n\nAt approximately 16:12, a timer activated the bomb which exploded destroying 20\u00a0vehicles parked nearby and causing a hole of around 5 metres in diameter in the ground floor of the shopping centre through which a huge ball of flame penetrated. Several of those unaffected by the flames were asphyxiated by the toxic gases produced causing several fatalities. The damage at the scene was so extensive that several of the corpses could not be located until two hours later and some had been burned so severely that identification was impossible. Initially 15 people were killed, of whom ten were women (one of whom was pregnant), three men and two children. However, the death toll then rose to 21, as six victims soccumbed to their injuries.\n\n==Telephone warnings==\nIn a subsequent communique ETA said they had given advance warning of the bomb but the police had failed to evacuate the area. The police said that the warning had come only a few minutes before the bomb exploded.\n\nThe Spanish news agency said a man claiming to speak for ETA had told the Barcelona newspaper Avui 30\u00a0minutes before the blast at 16:15 that a bomb would go off in the store. \n\nA spokesman at the store said police officers and private security guards began searching the store minutes before the blast. However the store management decided not to evacuate the store as it was not the first time that a bomb threat had been received. Ferran Cardenal, the Barcelona Civil Governor, said at a news conference that the police had searched the building before the bombing but found nothing.\n\nThree telephone warnings  had been received from a man who claimed to be an ETA spokesman with the first of the calls coming 57 minutes before the explosion. Some relatives said they would sue the police and the Hipercor store for failing to clear the crowded building after receiving the warnings. A store spokesman said it was up to the police to clear a building. But the Government spokesman said the decision was up to management. \"The building is private property. It's difficult to go against the will of the owners. The police's action was appropriate at all times.\"\n\n==Reactions==\nPrime Minister Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez, cut short a visit to Brazil to return to Spain. He told reporters in Salvador, Brazil: \"This attack is of a different style than what we have seen to date. It is an attempt to force the Government to change tack. But we will not give in to indiscriminate violence. We shall continue fighting terrorism with all the means we have.\"\n\nThere was almost universal condemnation of the attack. Some leaders of Batasuna also felt compelled to condemn the attack, although they pointed out that they did so in a personal capacity and not as party spokesmen.\n\nAn estimated 750,000\u00a0people marched through Barcelona with banners declaring, \"Catalonia Rejects Terrorism\". Around 700,000\u00a0workers paused for five minutes of silence to condemn the attack. While an ETA spokesman apologised for the attack, this apology was criticised, with the Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia asking: \"Does anyone who does not want to kill many people plant a bomb in a supermarket, at a peak hour on a Friday?\"\n\nFollowing the arrest in 1993 of the bomber Sim\u00f3n, The Independent noted that \"The attack was seen by many as a turning-point in the organisation's fortunes, its cold-blooded murder of women and children sickening many Basques who until then had sympathised with the group's aims.\"\n\n==Subsequent arrests and trial==\nOn 9 September 1987, Domingo Troiti\u00f1o and Josefa Ernaga were detained and on 23 October 1989 both were given sentences of 794\u00a0years in prison and fined more than 1,000\u00a0million pesetas. The Spanish Central Criminal Court ruled that they had acted in a premeditated manner and had spent a considerable time before the attack weighing up all the possible consequences. \n\nBoth were ordered to pay 320\u00a0million pesetas to the stores and to 114 people who had been injured in the attack. Additionally they were ordered to pay 525\u00a0million pesetas by way of civil responsibility to the families of those who had been killed and 200,650,000\u00a0pesetas to another 45\u00a0people who had been injured in the bombing. At the trial Troiti\u00f1o and Ernaga attempted to justify their actions, stating that they had only intended to incinerate the stores, not cause deaths, although they were aware there were inhabited buildings at the back of Hipercor.\n\nIn 1993, Rafael Caride Sim\u00f3n was arrested in France. Spanish police alleged that Caride Sim\u00f3n had been the former head of ETA's so-called \"Barcelona Commando\" and had planned the Hipercor attack. On 23 July 2003 he was sentenced to 790\u00a0years in prison for carrying out the attack, while at the same trial, Santi Potros received the same sentence for ordering the attack.\n\n==References==",
