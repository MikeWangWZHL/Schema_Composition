    "article": "On 3 December 1996 an IED detonated on the southbound tracks of the Gare de Port-Royal R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional station in Paris, France. Four people were killed in the bombing: two French citizens, a Moroccan and a Canadian.\n\nFollowing the bombing, French officials activated the \"Vigipirate\" nationwide security plan drawn up a year earlier in the wake of a series of bombings by the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria (GIA). The plan included police and army patrols in sensitive public areas and spot checks across the country.\n\nNo group took responsibility for the attack, but the GIA was suspected of being behind the attack. However, unlike this bombing, the group had claimed all the bombings in the campaign.\n\n==See also==\n* 1995 France bombings\n\n== References ==",
