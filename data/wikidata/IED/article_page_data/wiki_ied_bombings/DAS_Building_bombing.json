    "article": "The DAS Building bombing was a truck bomb attack in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, at 7:30 am on December 6, 1989, targeting the Administrative Department of Security (DAS) headquarters.\n\nA truck parked near the building exploded, killing 63 people and injuring about 1,000. The bomb blast, an estimated 500\u00a0kg of dynamite, leveled several city blocks and destroyed more than 300 commercial properties.\nIt is widely believed that the Medell\u00edn Cartel was responsible for the attack, in an attempt to assassinate DAS director Miguel Maza M\u00e1rquez, who escaped unharmed. The same group was believed to be behind the bombing of Avianca Flight 203 the previous month.\n\nThe DAS building bombing was the last in the long series of attacks that targeted Colombian politicians, officials, and journalists in 1989, which started with the January 18 killing of 12 judicial officials in Simacota.\n\n==References==\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffects of the bomb.",
