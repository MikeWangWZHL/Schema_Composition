    "article": "The 2004 Multan bombing was a car bombing that took place in Multan, Punjab, Pakistan on October 7, 2004. The death toll was 40 and the number of injured was close to 100.\n\n==Incident==\nThe attack happened around 4:30 am and was carried out against Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan members who gathered in thousands to mourn the death of their leader Azam Tariq. The bomb, according to Interior Minister Aftab Khan Sherpao was remote-controlled and was placed inside of a Suzuki car. Eyewitnesses reported that they heard two blasts with a 20-second interval. Besides killing innocent civilians the bomb also damaged some nearby buildings and left puddles of blood and human flesh scattered around.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nAfter the attack the Pakistani police were deployed to the site amid the attacks from protestors who burned tires, damaged windscreens, and attacked two ambulances. Later on the police arrested Irfan Ali Shah who was eventually found guilty on 40 counts of terrorism for masterminding the double bombing and was sentenced to death in 2006.\n\n==References==",
