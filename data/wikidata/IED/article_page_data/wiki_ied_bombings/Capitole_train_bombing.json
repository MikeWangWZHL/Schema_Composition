    "article": "The Capitole train bombing was the bombing of a Le Capitole train on the Paris-Toulouse express near Limoges in France on 28 March 1982. The attack killed five people and injured 28 others. The bombing was claimed by a group calling itself \"International Terrorist Friends of Carlos\", and was later attributed to Venezuelan terrorist Carlos the Jackal. In December 2011 Carlos was convicted for the bombing whilst he was already serving life imprisonment. The attack was followed with the bombing of an anti-Syrian newspaper office in Paris in April.\n\n==See also==\n*Terrorism in France\n*List of terrorist incidents in France\n*TGV train and Marseille station bombings\n\n==References==",
