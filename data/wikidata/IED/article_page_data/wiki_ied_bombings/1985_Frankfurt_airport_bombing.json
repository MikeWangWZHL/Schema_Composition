    "article": "On 19 June 1985, a bombing at the Frankfurt Airport, West Germany, killed three and wounded 74 people. A second bomb was found and defused not far from the first explosion. Two of those killed were Australian children, 2-year-old and 5-year-old siblings, and the third a Portuguese man.\n\nAbout 30 groups claimed responsibility, among them an unprecedented group calling itself Arab Revolutionary Organisation, having done so because of West German intelligence recruiting Arabs to assassinate members of Arab revolutionary movements in Lebanon. In July 1988, West German investigators concluded that the Palestinian Abu Nidal Organization, which itself had also claimed responsibility, had perpetrated the attack, and that the Libyan embassy in Bonn had pre-knowledge of the attack. The investigators also claimed that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi may have played a role in the attack.\n\n==See also==\n*1985 Rome and Vienna airport attacks\n*1985 Rhein-Main Air Base bombing\n*1986 West Berlin discotheque bombing\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n*  View of the destroyed hall B after a bomb exploded at the airport in Frankfurt (Germany) on 19 June 1985",
