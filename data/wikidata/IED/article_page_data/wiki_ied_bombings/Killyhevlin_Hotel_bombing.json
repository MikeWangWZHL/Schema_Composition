    "article": "On Saturday 13 July 1996 a bomb planted by the Continuity IRA blew up in Killyhevlin Hotel, Enniskillen, County Fermanagh during a Catholic wedding. The bomb was estimated to have contained  of home-made explosive. The blast slightly injured 17 people. It left a crater  wide in the car park and destroyed at least a dozen cars. The hotel received two bomb warnings at 11.40 p.m. The warning stated that a silver grey Isuzu jeep with the registration number 92RN92 contained a bomb and was parked in the hotel car park.\n\nThe attendants at the wedding blamed the group for ending the wedding on what they called a terrible note.\n\n==Precursor events and reaction==\nA silver Isuzu Trooper jeep was stolen in Dublin on 3 July. On 4 July it was stopped at a Garda Siochana checkpoint at midnight near Redhills in County Cavan. The driver was asked for insurance and identification and drove off quickly.\n\nThe RUC were warned to watch out for the jeep. Three days later the RUC spotted it near Newtownbutler in Fermanagh. The RUC officers left the jeep and when they returned the vehicle was gone.\n\nLiz O'Donnell of the Progressive Democrats said: \"There will have to be questions asked at the most senior level. There has obviously been a lapse... Clearly, from their own security point of view, if a suspect vehicle is pointed out it should be followed up.\"\n\nThe Irish Minister for Justice Nora Owen said the slip-up was raised at the Anglo-Irish Conference.\n\n==See also==\n* Timeline of Continuity Irish Republican Army actions\n\n==References==",
