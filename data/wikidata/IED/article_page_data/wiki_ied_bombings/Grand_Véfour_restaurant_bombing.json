    "article": "On 23 December 1983, the Le Grand V\u00e9four restaurant in Paris was damaged in a bomb attack, in which twelve people were wounded. The attack in one of Paris's most exclusive restaurants left a large crater in its front. Five of the injured diners were Americans, and two were Japanese.\n\nRaymond Oliver, owner of Le Grand V\u00e9four, was quoted by his daughter as saying \"I am ruined. My clients trust me and this had to happen to me as I reach the end of my career.\"\n\nNobody claimed responsibility for the attack. The Action Directe terror group also denied involvement, saying it did not carry any political significance. The case file was closed by police and no one has been apprehended.\n\n==See also==\n*Chez Jo Goldenberg restaurant attack\n\n==References==",
