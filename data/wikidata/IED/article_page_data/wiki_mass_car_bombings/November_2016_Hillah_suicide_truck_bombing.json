    "article": "-->\n}}\n\n\nA suicide bombing occurred in Iraq on 24 November 2016 when a truck bomb exploded at a petrol station in Hillah, some 100 kilometers (62 miles) from southern Baghdad, killing at least 125 people and injuring many others.\n\nShia pilgrims were en route back to Iran after the 2016 Arba'een Pilgrimage. Besides Iranians, people from Basra and Nasiriyah were also killed in the attack.\n\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for it.\n\n==Bombing==\nThe pilgrims were on their way back to Iran from the holy city of Karbala after participating in the annual Arba'een Pilgrimage. According to a police official, five buses filled with pilgrims stopped by a famous restaurant, next to a petrol station, burst into flames after the detonation of an \"explosives-laden truck\". According to a report, the bomb had been packed with 500 liters of ammonium nitrate.\n\nReportedly, the Hillah suicide truck bombing happened a day after dozens of bombings in and around Baghdad by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in which 31 people were killed and over 100 injured. There were some attacks during Arba'een this year, but these were insignificant compared to incidents in previous years. Despite ongoing dangers, people from around the world continued their journey to Karbala. According to Iraqi officials, approximately three million Iranians visited Iraq, making them the largest contingent of foreigners at the Arba'een Pilgrimage in 2016.\n\n==Perpetrator==\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\n==Motivation==\nAfter the offensive launched on 17 October to liberate the last remaining city in Iraq under ISIL control, Mosul, Daesh intensified their attacks aiming to weaken the Mosul offensive.\n\n==Reactions==\n*  \u2013 Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi condemned the attack and said that Iran would continue to support Iraq's \"relentless fight against terrorism.\" Furthermore, in a message, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani criticized the attack stating that it is a sign of frustration among the terrorists who could not bear the peaceful rituals managed and observed in the city of Karbala during the current Arbaeen pilgrimage.\n*  \u2013 The White House issued a statement that read it condemns the attack saying the bombing \"was clearly intended to stoke sectarian tensions.\"\n* Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani condemned the Hilla attack and warned that the perpetrators would receive a response to their crimes on the battleground at Mosul.\n\n==See also==\n* List of Islamist terrorist attacks\n* List of mass car bombings\n* List of terrorist incidents in November 2016\n* List of terrorist incidents linked to ISIL\n* March 2016 Hillah suicide truck bombing\n* 2005 Al Hillah bombing\n* Number of terrorist incidents by country\n* Terrorist incidents in Iraq in 2016\n* Timeline of ISIL-related events (2016)\n* Timeline of the Iraq War (2016)\n\n\n\n==References==",
