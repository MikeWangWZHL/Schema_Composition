    "article": "The Omagh bombing was a car bombing  on 15 August 1998 in the town of Omagh, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. It was carried out by a group calling themselves the Real Irish Republican Army, a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) splinter group who opposed the IRA's ceasefire and the Good Friday Agreement. The bombing killed 29 people (including a woman pregnant with twins) and injured some 220 others, making it the deadliest single incident of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Telephoned warnings had been sent almost 40 minutes beforehand but were inaccurate, and police had inadvertently moved people toward the bomb.\n\nThe bombing caused outrage both locally and internationally, spurred on the Northern Ireland peace process and dealt a severe blow to the dissident Irish republican campaign. The Real IRA denied that the bomb was intended to kill civilians and apologised; shortly after, the group declared a ceasefire. The victims included people of many backgrounds and ages: Protestants, Catholics, six teenagers, six children, a woman pregnant with twins, two Spanish tourists and others on a day trip from the Republic of Ireland. Both unionists and Irish nationalists were killed and injured. As a result of the bombing, new anti-terrorism laws were swiftly enacted by both the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. \n\nIt has been alleged that the British, Irish and US intelligence agencies had information which could have prevented the bombing, most of which came from double agents inside the Real IRA, but this information was not given to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). In 2008, the BBC reported that British intelligence agency GCHQ was monitoring conversations between the bombers as the bomb was being driven into Omagh.\n\nA 2001 report by the Police Ombudsman said that the RUC Special Branch failed to act on prior warnings and criticised the RUC's investigation of the bombing. Police reportedly obtained circumstantial and coincidental evidence against some suspects, but they were unable to convict anyone of the bombing. Colm Murphy was tried, and convicted. He was released on appeal after it was revealed that the Garda\u00ed forged interview notes used in the case. Murphy's nephew Sean Hoey was also tried but was acquitted. In June 2009, the victims' families won a \u00a31.6 million civil action settlement against four defendants, who were found liable for the bombing. In 2014, Seamus Daly was charged with the murder of 29 people; however, the case against him was withdrawn in 2016.\n\n== Background ==\n\nNegotiations to end the Troubles had failed in 1996 and there was a resumption of political violence, which peaked during the Drumcree crises. The peace process resumed in 1997. Sinn F\u00e9in accepted the Mitchell Principles in September 1997, which involved commitment to non-violence, as part of the peace process negotiations. Dissident members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (Provisional IRA), who considered this as a betrayal of the republican struggle for a united Ireland, left in October 1997 to form the Real Irish Republican Army (Real IRA).\n\nThe Real IRA's tactics were the same as those of the IRA before it. It targeted the British security forces and also carried out bombings of symbolic or economic targets. The goal was to damage the economy and cause severe disruption, to put pressure on the British government to withdraw. Warnings were sent before such bombings, along with a code word so that the authorities would know it was genuine. The Real IRA began its paramilitary campaign with an attempted car bombing in Banbridge, County Down on 7 January 1998. The  explosive was defused by security forces. Over the following months, it mounted several car bomb and mortar attacks. There were attacks or attempted attacks in Moira, Portadown, Armagh, Newry, Lisburn, Belfast, and Belleek, as well as another car bombing in Banbridge on 1 August, which caused thirty-five injuries but no deaths.\n\nThe Omagh bombing took place 13 weeks after the Good Friday Agreement of April 1998 was signed. Intended to be a comprehensive solution to the Troubles, it had broad support both in Ireland and internationally.\n\n== Attack ==\n\n=== Preparation and warnings ===\n\nOn 13 August, a maroon Vauxhall Cavalier was stolen from outside a block of flats in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, Republic of Ireland. At that time it bore the County Donegal registration number of 91 DL 2554. The bombers replaced its Republic of Ireland number plates with fake  Northern Ireland plates (MDZ 5211), and loaded the car with about  of fertiliser-based explosives.\n\nOn Saturday 15 August, the bomb car was driven from County Monaghan across the Irish border to Omagh, travelling north and west. A 'scout car' drove ahead of the bomb car to warn it of any checkpoints, and the two cars were in constant contact by mobile phone. At 14:19, the bomb car was parked outside S.D. Kells' clothes shop on Omagh's Market Street, at the eastern edge of the town centre, near the crossroads with Dublin Road. The driver could not find a parking space near the intended target, Omagh Courthouse. The two male bombers armed the bomb and set the timer to detonate it in 40 minutes. They left the car and walked east down Market Street towards Campsie Road, before leaving Omagh in the scout car. A family of Spanish tourists happened to take photos by the car. The photographer died in the bombing, but the man and child in the photograph survived.\n\nAt around 14:30, three phone calls were made warning of a bomb in Omagh, using the same codeword that had been used in the Real IRA's bombing in Banbridge two weeks earlier: \"Martha Pope\". The calls were made from telephone boxes many miles away in southern County Armagh. The first warning was telephoned to Ulster Television saying, \"There's a bomb, courthouse, Omagh, main street, 500lb, explosion 30 minutes\". One minute later, the office received a second warning saying, \"Bomb, Omagh town, 15 minutes\". The caller claimed the warning on behalf of \"\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann\". The next minute, the Coleraine office of the Samaritans received a call stating that a bomb would go off on the \"main street\" of Omagh \"about 200 yards\" (180 m) from the courthouse. The recipients passed on the information to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).\n\nThe BBC News stated that police \"were clearing an area near the local courthouse, 40 minutes after receiving a telephone warning, when the bomb detonated. But the warning was unclear and the wrong area was evacuated\". The warnings mentioned \"main street\" when there was no street by that name in Omagh, although Market Street\u2013High Street was the town's main shopping street. It runs for hundreds of yards east\u2013west from the site of the bomb to the courthouse. Given the warnings, police believed the bomb was near the courthouse, so they evacuated the surrounding buildings and streets. As it happened, they moved people away from the courthouse and towards the site of the bomb, placing a cordon at Scarffe's Entry. The courthouse is roughly  from the spot where the car bomb was parked. During the later Special Criminal Court trial of Real IRA director Michael McKevitt, witnesses for the prosecution said that the inaccurate warnings were accidental.\n\n=== Explosion and aftermath ===\n\nThe car bomb exploded at about 15:10 BST in the crowded shopping area. It tore the car into deadly shrapnel and created a fireball and shockwave. People were caught in \"a storm\" of glass, masonry and metal, as the blast destroyed shop fronts and blew the roofs off buildings. A thick cloud of dust and smoke filled the street. The blast was so strong that it tore up concrete and pipes burst. The water running down the street, turned red from the blood of wounded people. Within 25 minutes journalists were on the street taking pictures. Twenty-one people who had been standing near the bomb were killed outright. Eight more died on the way to or in hospital.\n\nInjured survivor Marion Radford described hearing an \"unearthly bang\", followed by \"an eeriness, a darkness that had just come over the place\", then screams as she saw \"bits of bodies, limbs\" on the ground while she searched for her 16-year-old son, Alan. She later discovered he had been killed yards away from her, after the two became separated minutes before the blast.\n\n\n\nThe BBC News said that survivors described scenes of \"utter carnage,\" with the dead and dying \"strewn across the street and other victims screaming for help\". The injured were initially taken to two local hospitals, the Tyrone County Hospital and the Erne Hospital. A local leisure centre was set up as a casualty field centre, and the British Army's Lisanelly Barracks served as a makeshift morgue. According to the Conflict Archive on the Internet, rescue workers likened the scene to \"battlefield conditions\". Tyrone County Hospital became overwhelmed, and appealed for local doctors to come in to help.\n\nBecause of the stretched emergency services, buses, cars and helicopters were used to take the victims to other hospitals in Northern Ireland, including the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry. A Tyrone County Hospital spokesman stated that they treated 108 casualties, 44 of whom had to be transferred to other hospitals. Paul McCormick of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said, \"The injuries are horrific, from amputees, to severe head injuries to serious burns, and among them are women and children.\" The morning after the bombing, a man was killed when his car collided with an ambulance ferrying bomb victims to hospitals in Belfast.\n\nOmagh Leisure Centre was used as a base for relatives and friends of the victims. There they could receive news updates.\n\n====Victims====\nA total of 18 Catholics, (including two Spaniards), and 11 Protestants were among the victims.\n\n* Catholics\n** James Barker (12), Se\u00e1n McLaughlin (12) and Oran Doherty (8), from County Donegal\n** Fernando Blasco Baselga (12) and Roc\u00edo Abad Ramos (23) from Spain\n** Geraldine Breslin (43)\n** Gareth Conway (18)\n** Breda Devine (1)\n** Aidan Gallagher (21)\n** Mary Grimes (65)\n** Brenda Logue (17)\n** Brian McCrory (54)\n** Se\u00e1n McGrath (61)\n** Jolene Marlow (17)\n** Avril Monaghan (30; Monaghan was pregnant with twins)\n** Maura Monaghan (1)\n** Elizabeth Rush (57)\n** Philomena Skelton (39)\n\n* Protestants\n** Deborah-Anne Cartwright (20)\n** Esther Gibson (36)\n** Olive Hawkes (60)\n** Julia Hughes (21)\n** Ann McCombe (48)\n** Samantha McFarland (17)\n** Alan Radford (16)\n** Veda Short (56)\n** Fred White (60)\n** Bryan White (26)\n** Lorraine Wilson (15)\n\nSe\u00e1n McGrath was the last victim to die. He was in a critical condition in hospital for three weeks before dying from his injuries on 5 September 1998.\n\n=== Reactions ===\nThere was a strong international and regional outcry against 'dissident' republicans and in favour of the Northern Ireland peace process. Prime Minister Tony Blair called the bombing an \"appalling act of savagery and evil.\" Queen Elizabeth II expressed her sympathies to the victims' families, while the Prince of Wales paid a visit to the town and spoke with the families of some of the victims. Pope John Paul II and President Bill Clinton also expressed their sympathies. The Spanish Ambassador to Ireland visited some of the injured. \n\nChurches across Northern Ireland called for a national day of mourning. Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh Robin Eames said on BBC Radio that, \"From the Church's point of view, all I am concerned about are not political arguments, not political niceties. I am concerned about the torment of ordinary people who don't deserve this.\" \n\nSocial Democratic and Labour Party leader John Hume called the perpetrators of the bombing \"undiluted fascists\".\n\nSinn F\u00e9in's Martin McGuinness said, \"This appalling act was carried out by those opposed to the peace process,\" while Gerry Adams said, \"I am totally horrified by this action. I condemn it without any equivocation whatsoever.\" McGuinness mentioned that both Catholics and Protestants alike were injured and killed, saying, \"All of them were suffering together. I think all them were asking the question 'Why?', because so many of them had great expectations, great hopes for the future.\" Sinn F\u00e9in as an organisation initially refused to co-operate with the investigation into the attack, because the Royal Ulster Constabulary was involved. On 17 May 2007, McGuinness stated that Irish republicans would co-operate with an independent, international investigation if one were created.\n\nThe security forces believed the Real IRA were responsible. RUC Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan accused the bombers of deliberately trying to direct civilians towards the bomb. \n\nAs the trial of a suspect started in 2006, British government prosecutor Gordon Kerr QC called the warnings \"not only wrong but... meaningless\" and said that the nature of the warnings made it inevitable that people would be moved towards the bomb. \n\nThree days after the bombing, the Real IRA claimed responsibility for planting the bomb but strongly denied intending to kill civilians and apologised to the victims. It also announced that \"all military operations have been suspended\". The group came under intense pressure to end its campaign. Provisional IRA members visited the homes of 60 people connected with the Real IRA, and ordered them to disband and stop interfering with its arms dumps. On 7 September, the Real IRA called a ceasefire, although it would later resume its campaign.  The Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) also called a ceasefire on 22 August. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism has accused the INLA of providing supplies for the bombing. The INLA continued to observe the ceasefire and later began to disarm. The BBC News reported that, \"Like the other bombings in the early part of 1998 in places like Lisburn and Banbridge, Omagh was a conscious attempt by republicans who disagreed with the political strategy of Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, to destabilise Northern Ireland in that vulnerable moment of hope. It failed\u00a0\u2013 but there is a terrible irony to the way in which the campaign was halted only by the wave of revulsion triggered by the carnage at Omagh.\"\n\nIn response to the bombing, both the British and Irish governments vowed to enact tougher anti-terrorism laws. On 3 September, the British parliament passed the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998, and the Irish parliament passed the Offences Against The State (Amendment) Bill. Members of both governments described the measures as \"draconian\" and the bills were rushed through, despite protests from members of parliament and civil liberties groups. The new measures included allowing suspected members of terrorist groups to be convicted on the word of a senior police officer, curtailment of the right to silence, and longer detention periods.\n\n== Responsibility ==\n\n=== Allegations ===\nThe Real IRA claimed responsibility for the bombing at the time. However, on 7 February 2008, a RIRA spokesman stated that the group \"had minimal involvement in Omagh. Our code word was used; nothing more. To have stated this at the time would have been lost in an understandable wave of emotion\" and \"Omagh was an absolute tragedy. Any loss of civilian life is regrettable.\"\n\nOn 9 October 2000, the BBC's Panorama programme aired the special Who Bombed Omagh?, hosted by journalist John Ware. The programme quoted RUC Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan as saying, \"sadly up to this point we haven't been able to charge anyone with this terrible atrocity\". The programme alleged that the police on both sides of the Irish border knew the identity of the bombers. It said, \"As the bomb car and the scout car headed for the border, the police believe they communicated by mobile phone. This is based on an analysis of calls made in the hours before, during and after the bombing. This analysis may prove to be the key to the Omagh bomb investigation.\" Using the phone records, the programme reported the names of the four prime suspects as Oliver Traynor, Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy, and Seamus Daly. The police had leaked the information to the BBC since it was too circumstantial and coincidental to be used in court.\n\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson praised the Panorama programme, calling it \"a very powerful and very professional piece of work\". Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern criticised it, saying that \"bandying around names on television\" could hinder attempts to secure convictions. First Minister David Trimble stated that he had \"very grave doubts\" about it.\n\nLawrence Rush, whose wife Elizabeth died in the bombing, tried legally to block the programme from being broadcast, saying, \"This is media justice, we can't allow this to happen\". Democratic Unionist Party assembly member Oliver Gibson, whose niece Esther died in the bombing, said that the government did not have the will to pursue those responsible and welcomed the programme.\n\nThe police believe that the bombing of BBC Television Centre in London on 4 March 2001 was a revenge attack for the broadcast. On 9 April 2003, the five RIRA members behind the BBC office's bombing were convicted and sentenced to between 16 and 22 years.\n\n=== Prosecutions and court cases ===\nOn 22 September 1998, the RUC and Garda\u00ed arrested twelve men in connection with the bombing. They subsequently released all of them without charge. On 25 February 1999, they questioned and arrested at least seven suspects. Builder and publican Colm Murphy, from Ravensdale, County Louth, was charged three days later for conspiracy and was convicted on 23 January 2002 by the Republic's Special Criminal Court. He was sentenced to fourteen years. In January 2005, Murphy's conviction was quashed and a retrial ordered by the Court of Criminal Appeal, on the grounds that two Garda\u00ed had falsified interview notes, and that Murphy's previous convictions were improperly taken into account by the trial judges.\n\nOn 28 October 2000, the families of four children killed in the bombing \u2013 James Barker, 12, Samantha McFarland, 17, Lorraine Wilson, 15, and 20-month-old Breda Devine \u2013 launched a civil action against the suspects named by the Panorama programme. On 15 March 2001, the families of all twenty-nine people killed in the bombing launched a \u00a32-million civil action against RIRA suspects Seamus McKenna (died 14 July 2013), Michael McKevitt, Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy, and Seamus Daly. Former Northern Ireland secretaries Peter Mandelson, Tom King, Peter Brooke, Lord Hurd, Lord Prior, and Lord Merlyn-Rees signed up in support of the plaintiffs' legal fund. The civil action began in Northern Ireland on 7 April 2008.\n\nOn 6 September 2006, Murphy's nephew, Sean Hoey, an electrician from Jonesborough, County Armagh, went on trial accused of 29 counts of murder, and terrorism and explosives charges. Upon its completion, Hoey's trial found on 20 December 2007 that he was not guilty of all 56 charges against him.\n\nOn 24 January 2008, former Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan apologised to the victims' families for the lack of convictions in relation to the Omagh bombing. This apology was rejected by some of the victims' families. After the Hoey verdict, BBC News reporter Kevin Connolly stated that, \"The Omagh families were dignified in defeat, as they have been dignified at every stage of their fight for justice. Their campaigning will go on, but the prospect is surely receding now that anyone will ever be convicted of murdering their husbands and brothers and sisters and wives and children.\" Police Service of Northern Ireland Chief Constable Sir Hugh Orde stated that he believed there would be no further prosecutions.\n\nOn 8 June 2009, the civil case taken by victims' relatives concluded, with Michael McKevitt, Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly being found to have been responsible for the bombing. Seamus McKenna (died 14 July 2013) was cleared of involvement. The others were held liable for  of damages. It was described as a \"landmark\" damages award internationally. Murphy and Daly appealed and were granted a retrial, but this second trial also found them responsible for the bombing, with the judge describing the evidence as overwhelming.\n\nOn 10 April 2014 Daly was charged with murdering the 29 victims of the Omagh bombing and with other offences. Daly lived in Cullaville, County Monaghan, Republic of Ireland. He was arrested in Newry by police after he crossed the border into Northern Ireland. The case against Daly was withdrawn in February 2016, with the Public Prosecution Service deciding there was \"no reasonable prospect of conviction\".\n\n=== Police Ombudsman report ===\nPolice Ombudsman Nuala O'Loan published a report on 12 December 2001 that strongly criticised the RUC over its handling of the bombing investigation. Her report stated that RUC officers had ignored the previous warnings about a bomb and had failed to act on crucial intelligence. She went on to say that officers had been uncooperative and defensive during her inquiry. The report concluded that, \"The victims, their families, the people of Omagh and officers of the RUC were let down by defective leadership, poor judgement and a lack of urgency.\" It recommended the setting up of a new investigation team independent of the new Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), which had since replaced the RUC, led by a senior officer from an outside police force.\n\nInitially, the Police Association, which represents both senior officers and rank and file members of the Northern Ireland police, went to court to try to block the release of the O'Loan report. The Association stated that, \"The ombudsman's report and associated decisions constitute a misuse of her statutory powers, responsibilities and functions.\" The group later dropped its efforts. RUC Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan called the report \"grossly unfair\" and \"an erroneous conclusion reached in advance and then a desperate attempt to find anything that might happen to fit in with that.\" Other senior police officers also disputed the report's findings. Flanagan issued a 190-page counter-report in response, and has also stated that he has considered taking legal action. He argued that the multiple warnings were given by the RIRA to cause confusion and lead to a greater loss of life. Assistant Chief Constables Alan McQuillan and Sam Kincaid sent affidavits giving information that supported the report.\n\nThe families of the victims expressed varying reactions to the report. Kevin Skelton, whose wife Philomena died in the attack, said that, \"After the bomb at Omagh, we were told by Tony Blair and the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, that no stone would be left unturned\u00a0... It seems to me that a lot of stones have been left unturned,\" but then expressed doubt that the bombing could have been prevented. Lawrence Rush, whose wife Elizabeth died in the attack, said that, \"There's no reason why Omagh should have happened \u2013 the police have been in dereliction of their duty.\" Other Omagh residents said that the police did all that they could. The Belfast Telegraph called the report a \"watershed in police accountability\" and stated that it \"broke the taboo around official criticism of police in Northern Ireland\". Upon leaving office on 5 November 2007, Nuala O'Loan stated that the report was not a personal battle between herself and Sir Ronnie, and did not lead to one. She stated that the \"recommendations which we made were complied with\".\n\n=== Independent bombing investigation ===\nOn 7 February 2008, the Northern Ireland Policing Board decided to appoint a panel of independent experts to review the police's investigation of the bombing. Some of the relatives of the bombing victims criticised the decision, saying that an international public inquiry covering both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland should be established instead. The review is to determine whether enough evidence exists for further prosecutions. It is also to investigate the possible perjury of two police witnesses made during Sean Hoey's trial. Sinn F\u00e9in Policing Board member Alex Maskey stated that, \"Sinn F\u00e9in fully supports the families' right to call for a full cross-border independent inquiry while the Policing Board has its clear and legal obligation to scrutinise the police handling of the investigations ... We recognise that the board has a major responsibility in carrying out our duty in holding the PSNI to account in the interests of justice for the Omagh families\".\n\n=== Advance warning allegations ===\nIn 2001, a double agent known as Kevin Fulton claimed he told his MI5 handlers three days before the bombing that the RIRA was about to bring a \"huge bomb\" across the border. Fulton claims he also told them who he believed was making it and where it was being made. He said that MI5 did not pass his information over to the police.\n\nRUC Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan called the allegations \"preposterous\" and said the information Fulton gave his handlers was full of \"distortions and inaccuracies\". However, Flanagan admitted that some of Fulton's information was not passed to RUC Special Branch, due to \"an administrative error\". In September 2001, British security forces informer Willie Carlin said the Ombudsman had obtained evidence confirming Fulton's allegations. A spokesman for the Ombudsman neither confirmed nor denied this assertion.\n\nDavid Rupert, an American citizen, was jointly run as an agent by MI5 and the FBI. He worked as a fundraiser for the RIRA. On 11 August 1998, four days before the bombing, Rupert informed his MI5 handlers that the RIRA was planning a car bomb attack in Omagh or Derry. It is not known whether this information was passed to the RUC Special Branch.\n\nThe Garda\u00ed also had an agent close to the RIRA at the time. The agent, Paddy Dixon, stole cars for the RIRA, who used them to transport bombs. Days before the bombing, the RIRA had Dixon steal the maroon Vauxhall Cavalier it would use in the attack. Dixon immediately told his handler; Detective Sergeant John White. On 12 August, White passed this on to his superior; Detective Chief Superintendent Dermot Jennings. According to White, Jennings told him that they would let the bomb go through, mainly so that the RIRA would not become suspicious of Dixon.\n\nDixon fled the Republic of Ireland in January 2002. The following year, a transcript of a conversation between Dixon and White was released. In it, Dixon confirms that Garda\u00ed let the bomb go through and says that \"Omagh is going to blow up in their faces\". In February 2004, PSNI Chief Constable Hugh Orde called for the Republic of Ireland to hand over Dixon. In March 2006, Chief Constable Orde stated that \"security services did not withhold intelligence that was relevant or would have progressed the Omagh inquiry\". He stated that the dissident republicans investigated by MI5 were members of a different cell than the perpetrators of the Omagh bombing.\n\nA 2013 independent report concluded that the British, Irish and American intelligence agencies \"starved\" police in Omagh of intelligence that could have prevented the bombing. The report was commissioned by the victims' families and produced by Rights Watch (UK).\n\n=== GCHQ monitoring ===\nA BBC Panorama documentary, named \"Omagh: What the police were never told\", was aired in September 2008. It revealed that the British intelligence agency GCHQ was monitoring mobile phone calls between the bombers as the bomb was being driven into Omagh. Ray White, former Assistant Chief of RUC Special Branch, said GCHQ had been monitoring mobile phones at their request. He said he believed GCHQ were listening to the phone calls 'live', rather than merely recording them for later. Panorama journalist John Ware claimed that a listening device had been hidden in the car and that GCHQ had recordings of what was said. None of this information was given to the RUC in Omagh at the time. Transcripts of the phone calls were later handed over to RUC Special Branch.\n\n== Victims' support group ==\nThe families of the victims of the bomb created the Omagh Support and Self Help Group after the bombing. The organisation is led by Michael Gallagher, whose 21-year-old son, Aidan, was killed in the Omagh attack. Its web site provides over 5000 newspaper articles, video recordings, audio recordings, and other information sources relating to the events leading up to and following the bombing as well as information about other terrorist attacks.\n\nThe group's five core objectives are \"relief of poverty, sickness, disability of victims\", \"advancement of education and protection\", \"raising awareness of needs and experiences of victims, and the effects of terrorism\", \"welfare rights advice and information\", and \"improving conditions of life for victims\". The group also provides support to victims of other bombings in Ireland, as well other terrorist bombings, such as the 2004 Madrid train bombings. The group has protested outside meetings of the 32 County Sovereignty Movement, an Irish republican political activist group opposed to the Good Friday Agreement that the families believe is part of the RIRA.\n\nIn April 2000, the group argued that the attack breached Article 57 of the Geneva Convention and stated that they will pursue the alleged bombers using international law. Michael Gallagher told BBC Radio Ulster that, \"The republican movement refused to co-operate and those people hold the key to solving this mystery. Because they have difficulty in working with the RUC and Garda\u00ed, we can't get justice.\" In January 2002, Gallagher told BBC News that, \"There is such a deeply-held sense of frustration and depression\" and called the anti-terrorist legislation passed in the wake of the Omagh bombing \"ineffective\". He expressed support for the controversial Panorama programme, stating that it reminded \"people that what happened in Omagh is still capable of happening in other towns\".\n\nIn February 2002, Prime Minister Tony Blair declined a written request by the group to meet with him at Downing Street. Group members accused the Prime Minister of ignoring concerns about the police's handling of the bombing investigation. A Downing Street spokesman stated that, \"The Prime Minister of course understands the relatives' concerns, but [he] believes that a meeting with the Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office is the right place to air their concerns at this stage.\"\n\nThe death of Adrian Gallagher, along with the experiences of his father Michael and those of other families in the Omagh Support and Self Help Group formed the story of the television film Omagh, a Channel 4-RT\u00c9 co-production. Film-maker Paul Greengrass stated \"the families of the Omagh Support and Self Help Group have been in the public eye throughout the last five years, pursuing a legal campaign, shortly to come before the courts, with far reaching implications for all of us and it feels the right moment for them to be heard, to bring their story to a wider audience so we can all understand the journey they have made.\"\n\nIn promotion for the film, Channel 4 stated that the group had pursued \"a patient, determined, indomitable campaign to bring those responsible for the bomb to justice, and to hold to account politicians and police on both sides of the border who promised so much in the immediate aftermath of the atrocity but who in the families' eyes have delivered all too little.\"\n\n== Memorials ==\n\n=== Media memorials ===\nThe bombing inspired the song \"Paper Sun\" by British hard rock band Def Leppard.\n\nAnother song inspired by the bombings was \"Peace on Earth\" by rock group U2. It includes the line, \"They're reading names out over the radio. All the folks the rest of us won't get to know. Sean and Julia, Gareth, Ann, and Breda.\" The five names mentioned are five of the victims from this attack. Another line, \"She never got to say goodbye, To see the colour in his eyes, now he's in the dirt\" was about how James Barker, a victim, was remembered by his mother Donna Barker in an article in the Irish Times after the bombing in Omagh. The Edge has described the song as \"the most bitter song U2 has ever written\". The names of all 29 people killed during the bombing were recited at the conclusion of the group's anti-violence anthem \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" during the Elevation Tour; one performance is captured on the concert video U2 Go Home: Live from Slane Castle, Ireland.\n\nIrish state broadcaster RT\u00c9 and UK network Channel 4 co-produced the 2004 film Omagh dramatising the events surrounding the bombing and its aftermath. It was directed by Pete Travis and was first shown on television in both countries in May 2004.\n\n=== Omagh memorial ===\n\nIn late 1999, Omagh District Council established the Omagh Memorial Working Group to devise a permanent memorial to the bombing victims. Its members come from both public and private sectors alongside representatives from the Omagh Churches Forum and members of the victims' families. The chief executive of the Omagh Council, John McKinney, stated in March 2000 that, \"we are working towards a memorial. It is a very sensitive issue.\" In April 2007, the Council announced the launch of a public art design competition by the Omagh Memorial Working Group. The group's goal was to create a permanent memorial in time for the tenth anniversary of the bombing on 15 August 2008. It has a total budget of \u00a3240,000.\n\nSince space for a monument on Market Street itself is limited, the final memorial was to be split between the actual bombing site and the temporary Memorial Garden about 300 metres away. Artist Sean Hillen and architect Desmond Fitzgerald won the contest with a design that, in the words of the Irish Times, \"centres on that most primal yet mobile of elements: light.\" A heliostatic mirror was to be placed in the memorial park tracking the sun in order to project a constant beam of sunlight onto 31 small mirrors, each etched with the name of a victim. All the mirrors were then to bounce the light on to a heart-shaped crystal within an obelisk pillar that stands at the bomb site.\n\nIn September 2007, the Omagh Council's proposed wording on a memorial plaque \u2013 \"dissident republican car bomb\" \u2013 brought it into conflict with several of the victims' families. Michael Gallagher has stated that \"there can be no ambiguity over what happened on 15 August 1998, and no dancing around words can distract from the truth.\" The Council appointed an independent mediator in an attempt to reach an agreement with those families. Construction started on the memorial on 27 July 2008.\n\nOn 15 August 2008, a memorial service was held in Omagh. Senior government representatives from the UK, the Republic of Ireland and the Stormont Assembly were present, along with relatives of many of the victims. A number of bereaved families, however, boycotted the service and held their own service the following Sunday. They argued that the Sinn F\u00e9in-dominated Omagh council would not acknowledge that republicans were responsible for the bombing.\n\nA memorial service was held on 15 August 2018 to mark twenty years since the bombing. A bell was rung 32 times at 15:10, the time the bomb went off, to represent the 31 victims with an extra peal for those who have lost their lives in attacks all over the world.\n\n== See also ==\n* Timeline of Real IRA actions\n* Timeline of the Northern Ireland Troubles\n* The Troubles in Omagh\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n*\n*\n*\n\n== External links ==\n*  Bombing Memorial Website\n*  Omagh Support and Self Help Group\n*  Reflections on Omagh bombing from five years on\n*  Intelligence on Omagh bomb 'withheld from police'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLower Market Street, site of the bombing, 2001.
