    "article": "The 2011 Al Hillah bombing was an attack that took place in the city of Hillah on 5 May 2011. A suicide bomber detonated a car full of explosives at a local police station, killing 24 recruits and injuring at least 72 more. A few days after the explosion the Islamic State of Iraq claimed responsibility for it, saying it was revenge for the death of Osama Bin Laden on 2 May 2011. The insurgents apparently scouted the police HQ for some time before attacking during peak hours when more than 200 people were inside the building.\n\n==See also==\n\n\n* List of terrorist incidents, 2011\n\n== References ==",
