    "article": "The CID building attack was the result of a car bomb in Karachi, Pakistan, which occurred on 11 November 2010. Initial reports indicated the building housing the CID had collapsed and blast crater of 5 metres was discovered in close proximity. At least 18 people were killed and 100 injured, though casualty figures were expected to rise. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan claimed responsibility for the attack through Azam Tariq, their spokesman. However, the involvement of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi was also contested with interior minister Rehman Malik appearing sure of the possibility.\n\n== Attack ==\nThe attack was coordinated on the headquarters of Pakistan's Criminal Investigation Department (C.I.D), a department responsible for anti-terrorism operations, in what is described as the city's \"highest security zone\" \u2013 just metres away from the house of the provincial Chief Minister of Sindh and two five-star hotels. According to Tariq, the attack was carried out in retaliation for the continued drone attacks in northwest Pakistan. Authorities reported that five to six people were seen throwing grenades and firing at the gate of the building, consequently killing the guards posted there; moments later, a vehicle packed with explosives made its way inside and exploded just metres away from the building, causing damage and destruction to nearby structures as well. Additionally, other witnesses reported that prior to the blast, a gunfight had taken place between heavily armed militants and security forces; a local resident remarked that this firing continued for 20 minutes before the explosion had occurred.\n\n==See also==\n* List of terrorist incidents, 2010\n\n==References==",
