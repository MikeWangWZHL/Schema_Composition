    "article": "The Tyre headquarters bombings were two suicide bombings against the Israel Defense Forces' headquarters building in Tyre, Lebanon, in 1982 and 1983. The blasts killed 103 Israelis and 46\u201359 Lebanese, wounding 95 people and were some of the worst losses ever for the IDF. Israel believes both to be the responsibility of Hezbollah.\n\n==First bombing==\nAfter invading Lebanon in June, the Israeli military set up command posts to run the cities they occupied. On November 11, 1982, a Peugeot car packed with explosives struck the seven-story building being used by the Israeli military to govern Tyre. The explosion leveled the building and killed 75 Israeli soldiers, border policemen, and Shin Bet agents. In addition, anywhere from 14\u201327 Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners that were being held by Israel were killed. Twenty-seven Israelis and 28 Arabs were injured.\n\nThe Israeli government said soon after the blast, and insists to this day, that the explosion was an accident resulting from gas cylinders exploding. This is contrary to the three witnesses who saw the Peugeot speed to the building, the identification of the car's parts in the rubble of the building, and the existence of a Shin Bet report detailing the Hezbollah preparations for the bombing.\n\nThere is a monument near Baalbek, Lebanon, dedicated to 17-year-old Ahmad Qassir, the suicide bomber responsible for the attack.\n\n==Second bombing==\nAlmost a year later, a nearly identical bombing happened in Tyre. On November 4, 1983, a suicide bomber drove a pickup truck filled with explosives into a Shin Bet building at an army base in Tyre. The explosion killed 28 Israelis and 32 Lebanese prisoners, and wounded about 40 others.\n\n==See also==\n*1983 Beirut barracks bombing\n*1983 United States embassy bombing\n\n==References==\n\n\n==External links==\n*  When in Rome, don't forget the bombs of 1983 - Article on Ahmed Qassir\n*  Sacrifice and \"Self-Martyrdom\" in Shi'ite Lebanon\n*  Suicide Superpower: Martyrdom as a Weapon of Mass Destruction",
