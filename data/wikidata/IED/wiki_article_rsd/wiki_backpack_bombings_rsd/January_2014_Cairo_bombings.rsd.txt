On 24 and 25 January 2014 a series of bombs exploded in Greater Cairo. The first four explosions occurred on the day before the anniversary of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, with the fifth coming on the anniversary itself.

==24 January==


===Police headquarters===
The first was at the police headquarters in Cairo, Egypt, which were attacked with a large truck bomb just after 06:30 local time. CCTV caught a white truck stop at 06:29 outside the building, with the driver jumping into another car. The blast could be heard across the city, and gunfire was heard after the explosion. At least five people were killed and 75 injured. The front of the multi-storey building was badly damaged, as were the National Archives building and the Museum of Islamic Art, whose collection was severely damaged. Irina Bokova, Unesco's director-general, said: "This raises the danger of irreversible damage to the history and identity of the Egyptian people." After the explosion a large crowd gathered, some of whom sang chants against the Muslim Brotherhood, including ""The people demand the execution of the Brotherhood."

===Other bombs===
Three more bombs exploded in western Cairo: the first was near the Behoos Metro Station in the Dokki district (two people killed), the second was at a police station near the Giza pyramids (no casualties), and the third at the Radobis cinema in Giza (one person killed).

==25 January==
On 25 January another bomb exploded at 07:00 local time in the Ein Shams district of eastern Cairo but there were no casualties.

==Claims of responsibility==
