On 30 September 1983, a bomb detonated during an international fair at the Palais des Congr√®s (exhibition centre) in Marseille, France. One person was killed and 25 other people were injured in the attack, which happened near the American and Algerian stands.

Many groups claimed responsibility, including the Charles Martel Group, the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia, the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Factions and Commando Delta. The real culprits were never identified.
