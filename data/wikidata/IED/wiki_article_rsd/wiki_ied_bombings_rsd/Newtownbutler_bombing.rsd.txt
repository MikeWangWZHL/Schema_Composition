The Newtownbutler bombing was an attack on the village of Newtownbutler, County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland.

==History==
Around 10:30 BST 19 August 2019, a roadside bomb exploded at Cavan Road close to the village of Newtownbutler, County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland. It was preceded by the detection of a hoax device nearby at Wattlebridge Road, which is believed to have been a lure meant to attract police officers and soldiers into the area. It is suspected that the New IRA or the Continuity IRA were the perpetrators.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar condemned the attack in a joint statement. In addition, MLA Arlene Foster (DUP) and MP Michelle Gildernew (SF) of Fermanagh and South Tyrone issued statements against it.
