The 1987 Karachi car bombings were two car bomb blasts that took place on the evening of 14 July 1987 in the Saddar area of Karachi, Pakistan. The blasts killed 72 people and injured another 250. Many of those killed were street vendors selling mangoes, second-hand clothing and trinkets. The injured were taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre.

The Sindh government declared three days of official mourning. No group claimed responsibility, but the government issued a statement saying: "The explosions appeared to be the work of saboteurs of foreign origin."
