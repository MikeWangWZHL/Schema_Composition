On 15 January 1982, a bomb exploded in the Jewish Mifgash-Israel restaurant in West Berlin, West Germany, killing a child and wounding 46 people. Responsibility was claimed by Palestinian nationalists under the names "People's Federation for a Free Palestine" and the "Arab May 15 Organization for the Liberation of Palestine" in two separate claims. Six Palestinian suspected members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) were detained by police but released. Mohammed Rashid of the 15 May Organization who led the bombing of Pan Am Flight 830 on 11 August 1982 later reportedly provided information to investigators about the attack. Yehuda Zvi Blum, Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, said that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was responsible for the attack.
