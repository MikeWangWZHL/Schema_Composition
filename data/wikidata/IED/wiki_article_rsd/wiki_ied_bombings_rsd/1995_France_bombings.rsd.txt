The 1995 France bombings were a series of attacks that targeted public transport systems in Paris and Lyon Metropolis, as well as a school in Villeurbanne. They were carried out by the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), who were broadening the Algerian Civil War to France. The attacks killed eight people, all during the first attack on July 25th. The attack also injured about 157.

The assassination of Abdelbaki Sahraoui, a co-founder of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was a prelude to the extension of the Islamists' terrorist campaign to France.

==Attacks==
On July 25, 1995, a gas bottle exploded in the Saint-Michel station of line B of the RER. Place Saint-Michel and the surrounding bridges and streets filled with emergency vehicles. Parvis Notre-Dame became a helicopter landing site whilst a nearby café, Le depart Saint-Michel, was used as a field hospital. At 8pm, France 2 news announced that four people had been killed and another 40 injured in a "mysterious explosion". At that time, no official sources had confirmed that it was a terrorist attack. The terrorist attack was later confirmed, and the final outcome was said to be eight deaths and 117 injured. It was the deadliest terror attack in France since the 1983 Orly Airport attack, and would be the only deadly attack for the GIA's 1995 bombing campaign in France.

On August 17, a second bomb hidden in a trash can at the Arc de Triomphe wounded 16 people. The bomb was composed of a gas bottle with nails.

On August 26, a huge bomb was found on the railroad tracks of a high-speed rail line near Lyon. It was supposed to explode when a train passed. Fingerprints of Khaled Kelkal and Boualem Bensaïd were found on the bomb. The leader of the group, Khaled Kelkal was quickly identified and his picture appeared all over France. Bombing attacks continued with an attack on September 3 at an open market in the 11th arrondissement of Paris, causing three injuries; and on  September 7 when a car bomb exploded near a Jewish school in Villeurbanne, a town near Lyon, causing thirteen injuries.

The wanted suspect, Khaled Kelkal, was killed on September 29 by members of the French EPIGN gendarmerie unit near Lyon as he resisted arrest. Nonetheless, the attacks continued on October 6, the day of Khaled Kelkal’s funeral; another gas bottle exploded in the Maison Blanche station of the Paris Métro, wounding twelve people. Boualem Bensaïd’s fingerprints were again found on the bomb. The next day, a statement from GIA commander Djamel Zitouni, written on September 23, arrived at the Reuters press agency in Cairo. He said the "Jihad"- the "military strikes at the heart of France", were intended to punish it for supporting the Algerian government. A letter was also sent to Jacques Chirac through the French Embassy in Algiers, urging him to convert to Islam.

On October 17, a gas bottle exploded between the Musée d'Orsay and Saint-Michel–Notre-Dame stations of RER Line C, wounding 29. Investigators found a transportation card on Smaïn Aït Ali Belkacem used a few minutes before the attack in a nearby subway station.

Additional bombs were found and cleared without casualties during morning searches of Metro and RER stations, often in restrooms. Increased security mandated the removal of all public trash cans, to prevent bombs from being hidden within.

== Arrests and trials ==
Members of the Armed Islamic Group and the "Kelkal Group" have since been prosecuted on various charges. Some suspects fled to the United Kingdom. Extradition proceedings against Rachid Ramda began in 1995 and went on for nearly ten years, during which Ramda remained detained in London's Belmarsh Prison. Ramda was eventually extradited to France on December 1, 2005 in connection with the bombings. On October 26, 2007, Ramda was sentenced to life in prison for financing the attacks.

According to FBI terrorism consultant Evan Kohlmann, part of the money used to finance the bombings came from people connected to the Brandbergen Mosque in Haninge, Sweden.

== Aftermath ==
Algeria-France relations were heavily affected by these events. Chirac refused to welcome the Algerian ministers, openly saying that the GIA could have been manipulated by the Algerian secret services.

Legislation on terrorism in France was reinforced with a new law in 1996 allowing police forces to perform searches at night. Paris also suspended the Schengen Acquis and did not lift the border controls until March 1996.

Vigipirate, activated in September 1995, is still in place in 2020. The crisis lessened when Lionel Jospin became prime minister in 1997 and Abdelaziz Bouteflika became the new Algerian president.
