On 28 April 1996, a bomb hidden in the fuel tank of a crowded bus exploded in Bhai Pheru (now Phool Nagar), Kasur District, Punjab, Pakistan. The bus had stopped to pick up passengers at a village marketplace, when the blast made the bus burst into flames, killing over 50 people and injuring another 24.
