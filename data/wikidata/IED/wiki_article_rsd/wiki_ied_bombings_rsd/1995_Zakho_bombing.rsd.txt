At 8:18am on 27 February 1995, a car bomb exploded in Zakho, a city which is 12 miles from the Turkish border in Dohuk Governorate, Kurdistan Region, Iraq. It happened during the Iraqi Kurdish Civil War, which began nine months earlier. The bomb was made from 330 pounds of dynamite and exploded whilst the car was outside a coffee house which was on a street located in a busy marketplace. At least 54 people were killed. No-one claimed responsibility; the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan were suspected.
