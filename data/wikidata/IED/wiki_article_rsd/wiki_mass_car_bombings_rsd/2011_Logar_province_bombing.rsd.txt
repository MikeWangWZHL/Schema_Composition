The 25 June 2011 Logar province bombing was a suicide car bombing that occurred on 25 June 2011 in Azra District, Logar Province, Afghanistan targeting Akbar Khail hospital, a 10-bed facility  near the Pakistani border, killing at least 43 people, including children, pregnant women, and medical staff. The suicide bomber drove a sport utility vehicle through the front gate of the facility, striking a guard, before detonating his explosives. The blast destroyed the one-story hospital and buried people under the rubble. The Taliban denied responsibility for the attack, claiming the perpetrator to be  "someone with an agenda," possibly the Haqqani network.
