The March 2012 Damascus bombings were two large car bombs that exploded in front of the air intelligence and criminal security headquarters in the Syrian capital of Damascus. At least 27 people were reported killed and over a 140 injured in the fourth major bombing since the beginning of the uprising and the second in the city. As in previous cases, the opposition blamed the government for orchestrating attacks, while the government placed the blame on terrorists and foreign groups. 

==Background==
The bombing came near the date of the one year anniversary of the 2011-2012 Syrian uprising. There had already been two bombings in Damascus and one in Aleppo. Another Aleppo car bombing came the next day, followed by a car bombing in Daraa.

Two large car bombs exploded on 17 March 2012 at 7:30 AM in front of the air intelligence and criminal security headquarters in the Syrian capital of Damascus. At least 27 people were reported killed and over a 140 injured.
