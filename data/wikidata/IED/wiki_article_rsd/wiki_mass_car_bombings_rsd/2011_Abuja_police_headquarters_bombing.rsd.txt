The 2011 Abuja police headquarters bombing was believed to be the first suicide bombing in Nigeria's history. The attack occurred on 16 June 2011, when a suicide bomber drove a car bomb onto the premises of the Louis Edet House in Abuja, the headquarters of the Nigeria Police Force. He may have been trying to kill Inspector-General of Police Hafiz Ringim, whose convoy he followed into the compound, but he was stopped by security before he could do so.

It was confirmed that the bomber and a traffic policeman were killed, although authorities said there may have been up to six casualties.

The Sunni Islamist group Boko Haram claimed the explosion.
