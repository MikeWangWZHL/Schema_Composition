The 3 March 2010 Baqubah bombings were a series of three bombings in Baqubah, Iraq, on 3 March 2010 that killed at least 33 people and injured 55 others.  Baqubah, a mixed Sunni and Shia town, is the capital of Diyala Governorate, approximately  north of the country's capital, Baghdad.

The bombings occurred in the lead-up to the parliamentary elections scheduled for 7 March 2010. At 9:45Â am local time, a car bomb was detonated near a police station in the western part of the city.  A few moments later, approximately  away, another car bomb was detonated near the provincial building.  A suicide bomber later detonated a bomb at the hospital where some of the wounded were being treated.  The hospital bomber posed as a police lieutenant and rode an ambulance to the hospital. A fourth bomb was found near the hospital and defused.

After the bombings, a full curfew was imposed on the city of Baqubah, barring even pedestrians.  Among the dead were ten policemen, and Dr. Ali al-Timimi, head of Diyala Governorate's health department.

The perpetrator of the bombings has yet to be identified, but Al-Qaeda in Iraq had previously promised to disrupt the elections on 7 March.  Authorities, both American and Iraqi, have reportedly warned that more attacks could occur before, and even after the elections.  Despite the concerns, early voting began, as scheduled, the morning of 4 March.

Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said "It's disgraceful, it's deplorable. We strongly condemn it, that said, neither this attack nor any of the previous attempts to derail the electoral process and to destabilise the government have been or will be successful."
