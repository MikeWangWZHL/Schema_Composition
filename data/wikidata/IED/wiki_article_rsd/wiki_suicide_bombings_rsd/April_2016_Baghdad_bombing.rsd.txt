On 30 April 2016, a car exploded in southeastern Baghdad, targeting Shia pilgrims, walking to the Kadhimiyah shrine. It resulted in at least 38 deaths and 86 other wounded, according to local police officials. Numbers may still increase. However, other government security officials suggested, the target was an open-air market.
