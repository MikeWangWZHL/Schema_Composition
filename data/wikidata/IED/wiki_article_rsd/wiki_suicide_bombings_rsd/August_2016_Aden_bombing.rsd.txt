On the morning of August 29, 2016, a powerful car suicide bombing was conducted by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, on an army camp in Aden, Yemen in which 72 people died and 67 were wounded. The attack took place as new military recruits were signing up in a local government school. According to military sources, the recruitment was being done for new soldiers joining the Yemeni and Saudi Arabian led coalition army, fighting the Huthi rebels at the northern border with Saudi Arabia. ISIS claimed responsibility and referred to the bombing as a "martyrdom operation". The bombing was one of a series of terrorist attacks by Islamist militants, including Islamic State, in Yemen. The attacks were especially directed at soldiers, public defense workers, and recruits, as a consequence of the 18-month-old civil war between the Houthi movement and Hadi's supporters.

== Incident ==
On 29 August 2016, recruits at an army training camp had queued in line for breakfast, which was brought into the compound by a truck. The suicide bomber, a suspected member of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, entered the compound behind this truck. He then drove his vehicle into the gathering of people, blowing himself up in a suicide car bomb attack and killing himself. The large explosion collapsed the roof of a building, burying many people while causing damage to nearby buildings. Debris from the bombing was found all over the compound. At least 72 people were killed while at least 67 people were injured.

Editor-in-Chief of Yemen Post Hakim Almasmari called the incident a massacre, while stating that it is the worst terrorist attack that has ever occurred in Aden. Although Al-Qaeda has a large presence in the area, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant were the only ones to claim responsibility for the bombing.

== Reaction ==
President of Yemen, Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi condemned the bombing and called it a "cowardly terrorist act" of militants.
