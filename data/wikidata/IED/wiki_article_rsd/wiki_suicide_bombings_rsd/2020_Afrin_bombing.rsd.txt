On the afternoon of 28 April 2020, a truck bombing occurred a few meters away from the governorâ€™s residence in Raju street in Afrin, Aleppo Governorate, Syria. A bomb in a tank truck was detonated at an open-air market in Souk Ali in the city centre. The attack killed at least 53 civilians (including 11 children) and 12 Turkish-backed fighters, as well as injuring over 50 others.

The Turkish government blamed the People's Protection Units (YPG). The Syrian Democratic Council and the commander-in-chief of the Syrian Democratic Forces, Mazloum Abdi, condemned the bombing and blamed Turkish policy, pointing out that "gangs armed by Turkey" had been involved in similar attacks.

According to the German Marxist newspaper Junge Welt, the nature of the attack and recent tensions suggests a jihadist group. Clashes between jihadist militias of the Syrian National Army are regular occurrences in the Afrin and Idlib regions. Significant tensions have recently re-emerged between Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the main rebel jihadist force in Idlib, and the Turkish government. HTS has accused Ankara of treason since the Russian-Turkish ceasefire agreed in early March 2020. The week prior to the Afrin bombing, the militiamen destroyed a Turkish tank while the Turkish Air Force allegedly destroyed a HTS base by drone.
