At least 22 people were killed and 41 wounded in a suicide blast at the Supreme Court of Afghanistan in Kabul. The attacker, who was wearing a suicide vest, targeted a bus carrying judicial personnel who were leaving work for the day. All of the casualties were civilians. Islamic State claimed responsibility. The Supreme Court was locked down after the attack out of fear that gunmen might storm the building. In a separate incident, another bombing killed Abdul Khaliq Noorzai, the Afghan district governor of Khak-e-Safed in Farah Province.
