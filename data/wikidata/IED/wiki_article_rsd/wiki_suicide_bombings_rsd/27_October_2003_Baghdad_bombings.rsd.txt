The 27 October 2003 Baghdad bombings were the simultaneous suicide car bombings targeting the Red Cross compound, and four Iraqi police stations in Baghdad. The attacks killed 35 people and injured another 244.

The bombings all occurred within about 45 minutes of each other. Four suicide bombers died but the fifth, a Syrian, who attempted to blow up the fourth police station, failed after the man's car apparently failed to explode. He was shot and wounded by the Iraqi police and arrested.
