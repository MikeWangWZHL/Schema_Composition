On January 17, 2014 a suicide bomber detonated explosives at the gate of the Taverna du Liban, a heavily fortified restaurant in Kabul popular with foreign nationals, including diplomats, aid workers and journalists; two gunmen then entered the building and began "shooting indiscriminately." 21 people were slain.

The Taliban immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
