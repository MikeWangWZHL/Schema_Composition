A suicide bombing killed seven people on the morning of 11 February 2020 in Kabul, Afghanistan. It happened at a police checkpoint near the entrance to Marshal Fahim Military Academy in the west of the city. Two civilians, four military personnel and the bomber were killed. Twelve other people - including five civilians - were wounded.

In May 2019, a suicide bomber killed six people at the academy. No-one claimed responsibility for the February attack in Kabul, a city which has been bombed many times in recent years by both the Taliban and Islamic State.
