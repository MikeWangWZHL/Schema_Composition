Hamas took credit for the attack, which was carried out by Na'el Abu Hilail, 22, from el-Khader, just south of Bethlehem. Four of the victims were children on their way to school. Abu Hilail's father said he was pleased with his son, saying "Our religion says we are proud of him until the day of resurrection." His friends said he was a supporter of Islamic Jihad.
