A suicide bomber detonated a truck at a checkpoint outside the Somali Youth League hotel at 7:45pm on 26 February 2016 in Mogadishu, Somalia. It was followed by his accomplices clashing with the hotel's security guards. The police said that they ended the attack by killing the four insurgent gunmen. Five militants, including the suicide bomber, as well at 14 civilians were killed. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility. Sixteen other people were injured.

Five people were killed in a suicide bombing at the same hotel in January 2015.
